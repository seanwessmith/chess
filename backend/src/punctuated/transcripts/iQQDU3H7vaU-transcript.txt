Okay, so let's go [Music] okay, so we got felix bernas 1672, who plays the scandi? Now you guys already know that in the scandi it's standard routine to attack the queen, and if the queen goes to a5, which is the main line we go d4 occupying the center bishop f5 is the main line. We simply develop our pieces and knight c6, which is a a move that we've encountered in a slightly different version. Now we already know if you guys were attentive yesterday. The purpose of this move is to apply pressure on the d4 pawn. So from a logical perspective. Where can we develop this bishop to neutralize the knight yeah bishop b5 also remember that if he castles long he's liable to get his pawn structure completely ruined with bishop takes c6. So this is a good example of dynamic development. We tailor our development uh, based on what our opponent does, rather than kind of put our head down and develop our pieces to squares that just look nice regardless. Normally, if black plays c6 here, the bishop would come out to c4. But specifically here it's a good idea to come up to b5. Okay, so already black is in trouble. Actually this is a bad move and yeah and a move like bishop d7 with a singular jupiter would signal to us that it's time to punish him for this. So how can we apply? Some heat? Add some tabasco sauce to the position. How do we add some tobasco sauce to the position? Yeah? Absolutely we can go d5, and this is justified because we've got three pieces. Developed he's got only two. His king side is undeveloped and his queen is kind of stuck in mud here, so whoa knight, 65 pre-move, so he's got to go knight, b8, otherwise we're going to take his b yeah. So, okay, now, let's figure out what we should do here now uh we can take his bishop, but then we help him right. We help him redevelop his knight, which doesn't make much sense. The great thing about where his bishop is right now is that it's actually going to stop his knight from coming out to a good square. So the correct move in my opinion here would be something that a lot of people would struggle to play and, as I've said before, people just people struggle to play. Retreating moves, but retreating moves can be absolutely desp are absolutely indispensable. So, let's just drop our bishop back to c4 or d3. I like bishop c4 because it keeps the d5 pawn nice and protected. If we'd gone bishop d3, maybe he would have developed his knight to f6 and attacked the pawn. So he goes queen c5 now, instead of just meekly dropping the bishop back, we can ask ourselves: can we perhaps defend this bishop and make a useful move toward our development? And we actually can we can go queen e2 that x-rays, his king? We prepare bishop, e3 and long castle and we defend the bishop on c4, so the move yeah. So let's go bishop e3 attacking the queen with tempo and then basically against any move, we're going to complete our development by castling and now we are ready to move in for the kill, because he's he's not going to have enough time to complete his development. Just watch um. Let's see what he does, my guess is that he's going to probably play g6, no knight a6. So what does he want with this move? He probably wants to castle long and the first possible possibility, of course, is to take on a6, but you know I'm not sure that it's worth taking this pawn, because it opens up the b file for him and he can perhaps mount some counter play against against our arcane. So we got to ask ourselves: instead, how do we prevent him from castling here? Is there a inactive move that prevents him from castling and I'm looking for a subtle prophylactic move, a nice prophylactic move? That's also an active move, regardless of the fact that it's prophylactic very good guys, the move is 95.. If he castles, we can either play bishop takes a6, crushing him or knight takes f7, crushing him. So when you're stopping your opponent's threats, you want to also make sure that you're you're doing it in a way. That's not like you're, not going out of your way. Okay, so choose your poison. Let's actually just do this first, for the sake of simplicity. Now queen takes a6 is very tempting uh, but it actually meets with bishop to b queen to b7 so uh. I wouldn't burn that bridge just yet. Let's play knight takes f7 first, let's see how he plays if he goes rook g8 see now, ladies and gentlemen, if we play knight takes d8 at least he gets an exchange for the queen, so we play queen takes a6 so that after he goes queen b7, we can take his queen, but the point is not to trade queens. The point is that we are able to take the entire rook and then evacuate our night and the game is over. Does that make sense and look at this pawn also freezing his development entirely he's to try to fianchetto, but I mean doesn't matter what we do here. It's just over uh. We can do a bunch of different things. Let's uh, let's play it simple. Let's just double rooks on this open file and uh win the game. Man, I'm feeling pumped after that match good day good day, so he wants to get his knight to d6 and um. You know I. I call this a gate move. It's like he tries to close the gate and we got to get this rook to a good square before he closes the gate. What do I mean by that? Where can we put this rock? Where can we put this rook? No, but the gate? Okay. The gate is closed along the default. Of course, we can go rook a4. We can go like this, but I call this slipping through the gate. Right, we've slipped through the gate. Now the knight on d6 doesn't bother us because this rook on d7 combines with the knight to cause tremendous harm to black's king in black's, pawn okay. So this is just winning okay c6. Of course, here we can just play knight takes e7 check, that's the simplest! All points are refunded. Yes and uh. That's it. We will bring our other rook into the game as we like to do. Okay, let's just trade and go rook d1 and promote this pawn on e6 just go e7, rook, d8 and win the game. We can actually just remove it knight, d6 I'll, take the knight and then promote all right. My friend, I think, it's time to resign. What do you think you are andrew, tang, yes, good, so nice yeah, so basically a very simple game: uh we developed our pieces. He played knight c6, which is a very poor move. Bishop b5 is the key d5, basically closing him in, and then the glue move was bishop c4 see this move is what people really struggle to play at the approximate 1600 level, because it it you know, you associate retreating moves with something bad right. A retreating move means that something has gone wrong, but that absolutely is false and you can see that it's a retreating move in name only because we are basically leaving him unable to develop his queen side pieces in any adequate way and not to mention the fact that he hasn't developed his king's side. Chess.Com refunds, the point so queen e2 to defend the bishop. Now I want people to understand why the move b3 is not good. Can somebody explain to me conceptually why b3 is not good now in this specific position? It's fine, but but there is a specific concept here that I want everybody to fully understand: okay, so exactly you're leaving your knight on c3, undefended uh and that's a very dangerous thing to do. Okay and black can go b5 and he can try to dislodge the bishop and win the knight, be very careful about leaving your pieces undefended on squares, where they're accessible to your opponent's pieces a queen to d4 uh, beast slayer would not be good because it trades queens- and here in this position you want to preserve the queens in order to be able to attack. Why would you want to attack because you're ahead in development? The rest was very straightforward, literally just taking all of his pieces? Okay, next game, this was very simple yeah I won the bullet match ralph saad, let's go e4 again and he plays a okay, e6 c6. Now we already know this is weird uh we're not going to change our strategy based on weird moves that try to intimidate us okay, so he plays kind of a cross between a french and a chiropractor, not a great idea, because it's just very passive uh now. Should we play e5 here? What do you guys think? Should we play e5? Some people say yes, we can, but it's actually not a good idea. It's actually not a great move and after the game, I will explain in detail the two reasons and I'm just writing all this down. Sorry, why it's not a great move. Should we take on d5? Definitely not because that allows him to recapture and vacates the natural development square for the knights we're going to do nothing and he takes great look at how nice our knights are. Where should we put this bishop? Should we put it on c4? What do you guys think d3? Absolutely we shouldn't put it on c4, then it would be biting at granite, knight, f6. Now we can take the knight we can also not take the knight it doesn't really matter. We can drop the knight to g3 or we could support it with queen e2. There's a lot of ways to do this. Let's play it very simple: just take it and um. How should we solidify this pawn? What would be the best way of solidifying this part? I remember the key principle which I always share, which is that uh you want the piece of least value to do a particular task, so you have a choice between bishop e3 and c3, which be should you delegate the task of defending upon it? Certainly we should be the pawn building up a nice pawn chain now, black's bishop is very weak. Now I want to introduce you guys to a version of the greek gift sacrifice which a lot of people are not aware of. Now the greek gift sacrifice. I won't talk about at length in the interest of time, but you guys can see the elements of the greek gift in action. What is the problem here? Why can't we take on h7 and go knight g5? Obviously, black has a bishop that controls the square. So what can we do to take the g5 square under control? First, in preparation for the great gift sacrifice, and this is a attacking technique that everybody should be familiar with h4, let's see if he can, let's see if he actually spots, nope beautiful guys. This is our first greek gift sacrifice. Bishop takes h7 and I'm going to do some interesting research after the game, knight g5. Now what was the purpose of h4 if he takes on g5? What are we going to take with, of course, we're going to take with a pawn now, you guys might be like whoa whoa, but but he's taking our knight. What are we gonna attack with? Well, if you look, if he would have taken, we would have taken with a pawn and then the queen would have combined with a rook to deliver decisive threats down the h file. We have checkmate in three moves here or, like four moves. Something like that three moves. We have. We have two choices: we can go h5 and we can send the king onto a square where it can be discovered by the knight, but even better, is to go queen to d3 uh, because if he goes king h6, we don't even need to deliver a discovered check. We can simply checkmate him on h7. Now he goes king h5. We need to reason, logically, if we can find a way to send his king back to h6, then we will have queen h7 checkmate, but if we can find a way to send his king forward, let's say to g4, then we're gonna have queen f3 checkmate. Of course the move is g4 and he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't and it's checkmate. This is a very classic greek gift attack. Okay, so h4 was the key move right. It sets up the g5 square. Now I actually was going to research, who was the first ever person to actually come up with a great gift sacrifice. So, according to my research, the first person- and let me let me do a little search on megabase, the first person to have actually played a greek of sacrifice in an actual game. Let me see graco g aquino, graco 1620. I think graco invented the greek gift sacrifice. Now, where can we check this information classical era? Modern chess? Let's see if he talks about it, who invented the gree gift, sacrifice or the trojan sacrifice? Yeah, it's not um, but it looks like gioquino graco, who is a 17th century italian chess player, who wrote several manuscripts where he analyzed a bunch of openings and among them he came up with agree gift sacrifice um now a couple of you might ask a couple of you might ask yeah, let's change the title. Um speed run yes now um a couple of you might ask after h4 now, let's say that black sniffs this out and goes h6. Can anybody propose now a um a way that we can start to develop the attack on the king side? There's actually two possible moves and then we'll dial it back and I'll. Explain why not e5 in the opening, so knight g5 is possible, but he can actually not take the knight he'll just ignore the knight, so the first is to attack with a pawn. Now the pawn on h6 is what's called a hook. A hoke is a pawn that has moved from its original spot and is located near the king. A hook can be used by your pawns or by your pieces to open up the king side easy in an easier way, and you can do that by simply advancing to g5, okay uh. So that's number one number two is called building a battery and you can do that by playing bishop c2, followed by queen to d3. Now, why is the inclusion of h4h6 in white's favor watch? Let's say that black develops his knight and you go queen d3 you're, threatening checkmate on h7. Black is only one plausible way to defend against this, which is what well black technically has two ways, but really only one way to stop the queen from coming to h7. That is the move g6. But here's the thing look at this pawn very carefully guys. We can capture it. Not only can we capture that pawn, we can use the h-bond as a battering ram and shatter the other palm black loses, and if you compare that to the immediate bishop c2 then after g6, it is true that you can play h4 now and you can try to use the same pawn as the same battering ram the pawn on g6 is a lot better protected. So h4 is good not only because it sets up the greek gift sacrifice, but even if it is stopped, black must make concessions on his king side, which you can then use by building a battery, and if I were actually playing black here, how would what would I do? Um black's position is already very bad, but I would probably let me think, hmm yeah. No, this position is uh very, very bad for, like maybe g6 I don't know, no black's position is extremely difficult. Folks, there is one thing you can try, there's a trap you can set, you can try to go queen to d5 and what is the purpose of this move? Let's imagine the y now takes on h7 plays knight g5 king g8, and how is the uh? The greek gift usually followed up in this position. Obviously green h5, and why did I put a queen on d5? Can anybody tell me what is the purpose of queen d5? What move does black now have? This is often missed in greek gift sacrifices. The fact that you can actually defend the square on h7 you can play queen to f5, and then black screen comes around to g6 and the attack evaporates. So that's actually a way that you can defend against the great gift. You can allow the knight to get to g5 and the queen to h5, and then you can either place a bishop on this diagonal or a queen and defend the h7 pawn. Okay. Hopefully that makes sense now. The only thing I wanted to point out here is why the movie five is bad. It's not that it's bad! It's just that black has already spent three moves, moving his pawns. So, from a purely logical perspective, we want to keep the center as open as possible and e5 closes it up, which lessens the impact of black making crappy moves in the opening. The second thing that um, that I want you guys to notice is this: this is a pawn chain. Do does black, usually well, not just black but uh, when, when your opponent is a pawn chain, do you want to attack the tip of the pawn chain or the base of the pawn chain, usually by nimzovich's principle, now, not always but generally the base? Now? What can you tell me about the can black attack the base of the pawn chain? Can black attack the base of the pawn chain? And, if so, how? Yes, with c5- and here, is the problem in such positions? White wants to be able to play c3 in order to defend the base of the pawn chain here, believe it or not, the knight on c3 as natural as it looks, actually obstructs the pawn from coming to c3, which means that white's pawn chain collapses, not a disaster right. You can take big deal, but you know now: the pawn on e5 is weak and now black has good development for his pieces. So in positions where you have this kind of pawn chain with a pawn on e5 and upon d4, you usually want to make sure that you can play c3 in the event that black plays c5. Okay, but that's not that's a secondary thing. The primary thing is that I want to keep the center as open as possible. Uh, so remember you don't always have to react to some sort of move by your opponent. You can just continue developing. You can do nothing, okay, uh and hopefully that makes sense guys. We took c3 to defend the pawn and h4 to set up. The greek gift, sacrifice: okay, ready for the next game, guys, let's go m d bar mbdar: let's go with a sitilian: let's go with an accelerated dragon. Okay, so he goes c4, which is a move. It's a rare move. What is the prop? What is the uh drawback of this move? What is the drawback of this move? It's 2 am d4 is weak. Let's go knight. C6, how should we develop our pieces to maximally emphasize our control and cement rather our control over the d4 score? Where should this bishop go? Should it go on um on e7, or should it go somewhere else? So, d6 e5, ladies and gentlemen, would be counterproductive because it would weaken our own d5 square. You want to make sure that you're not overdoing this right. If you go e5, you create a symmetrical weakness on d5, and so we simply want a fiance with a bishop. We can basically pre-move it he's probably not going to go d4 and blender the pawn exactly now we go bishop g7, then we're going to go d6 and we can go knight f6. Another way of playing here would be e6 knight, ge7, that's the botvinic setup, but I think it's simpler to just go d6 preparing to develop the bishop. Now here's a question from a purely positional standpoint. What do we want to do here in in terms of again uh in enhancing our dominance over the d4 score? You guys have seen this idea before many times in various types of positions. What should be our plan here? Our next two moves, pin the knight and then what do we do and then take take the knight, because now we enhance our control over d4 now do we want to go knight d4? Quite yet? No, we do not. We can, but the threat is stronger than the execution. There's no point in rushing the move, knight, t4, let's wait for a better moment: let's complete our development. How should we complete our development uh? I don't love knight f6 as much, because it interferes it interferes with our control over the d4 square. Does that make sense? If we go knight f6, he can actually try to go d4 and absolve himself of that weakness, so we should think about where else we should put this knight before we go queen b6 and delegate our queen, the task of sort of artificially controlling d4. We should ask ourselves if the knight may have alternate accommodations made for it and it can e6 knight g7. Some of you might be looking at this and saying: wait. That's two moves right. Isn't it good to develop in one move? Well, yes, but look at how passive white's pieces are. You can afford to take the luxury of spending two moves if it means that you, you know you do something as important as keep control over this square. Okay, it goes b3. Now how should we proceed uh in this position? Well, I think we've completed our development. The time has come for us to put a knight on t4. Where can this knight on e7 go later I mean on the next move. Basically, where can it go bingo bingo? It can go to c6 and it can. It can support its brother over on d4. Look at this beautiful look at these stallions. Ladies and gentlemen, these are some stallions. Now he's probably gonna go f4, which is the correct idea that is white's. Only source of active counter play. Let's see what he does. How should we stop the move? F5, let's stop f5! I don't want it. I don't want to allow it. No you don't! No! No! No! Not on my watch not on my watch, give him the kemba mutombo not on our watch now, literally not on my watch. So how should we proceed in this position, and this is where a lot of people struggle uh, it seems like we've made all the necessary improvements, but now we need to continue applying pressure. There are several ways of doing that. The first question we should ask ourselves is: are there any pieces which can be activated, and certainly there are, if we look at our queen, our queen is not doing anything. Let's employ the queen. Let's give it a nice little job and its job is going to be to add pressure on the knight and add pressure on the a2 pawn. Then we can look at the rook on aid and say this rook is not doing anything. We can bring it to a more civilized square on e8, where it's at least in the center okay, queen h4. I will explain after the game why it's not good, although queen h4, actually is kind of, is totally fine. Also yeah, queen h4, is perfectly good, uh and uh. Some of you might be thinking, but wait a second. Isn't it a bad idea to bring the queen away from our king side? White is not attacking the king's side, so this is fine um. Actually, somebody put forward a really interesting idea. What about a queen side attack, let's make a queen side attack happen. How can we do that in order to get a queen-side attack going? We have to chip away at his pawn chain. We have to find a way to. You know, add some salt and pepper to this position, so we need to go b5, but let's not go b5 immediately. Let's prepare it by playing a6 so that, if he takes we can recapture with the fun and open up that a file. Then we justify the fact that we haven't moved the rook. Ah a4 perfect. We got him, we got him and, of course, the piece that wins the game is precisely the knight on d4 boom goes to dynamite. Knight takes you one and here's the funny thing. The other knight is then going to come to d4, but I have the most in your oh okay, thank you for the knight he should have taken with a rook. Okay g takes f5 taking tour of the center. Now, let's defend the pawn now, I want you guys to tell me the most like in your face: positional move. Ever we shouldn't go knight d4. There is a slightly more subtle move here. Bishop d4 get rid of this bishop. So then we have an eternal knight on d4. Exactly and let's not forget, our initial intention was to play p5. He rudely interrupted us by blundering a rook, but that doesn't mean we still don't have the idea of going p5 that that hasn't gone anywhere, we're going to go p5. We damn well we're going to go b5 because now we're off a rook there we go so not only did we complete our plan, we want to rook on the way and the game is over so rude. Okay, obviously, trading rooks here is perfectly good for us. If he doesn't trade, we're going to infiltrate we're going to threaten checkmate and we're going to attack the bishop and let's see if we can deliver a cool checkmate, let's bring the other rook into the game and I'm going to show you guys a very typical checkmating idea. Basically, our plan is going to be to make him resign, which he did okay great game now again here. A couple of you were very quick to say that we should play e5 to increase our control over the square, but be careful because this creates a symmetrical weakness on d4. Now here we play bishop g4 bishop takes f3 right. That's what I call the smith's love idea. Vasily smith love the former world champion from the soviet union had a very famous game which is shown to all all russian young chats players where he does exactly this. He goes like bishop g5 takes f6 and then he puts a knight on d5. I even showed you guys uh a couple of those examples. Yesterday, great stream, thank you lily and uh. This was actually a pivotal moment where we played e6 right um. So I just wanted to make sense to everybody why knight f6 is not quite as good. Now the smith's love game I've already showed, but if you guys want to see the the segment that I'm referring to uh here, it is sure, of course I can always show. So this is the smith's love game. You see smith rutakovsky, championship final moscow 1945.. So to test my hypothesis, let's see if this book is featured in, do I have a book that teaches young soviet children how to play chess? I do my favorite book. This is from 1952. This is a basically a complete manual of chess. Let me see if it's in the book short game. Smith's love is in the book, but not against rutakovsky. So here it's not but anyways, it's a very famous game. So this is liz sidson's book uh. What should uh? What should y do here, ladies and gentlemen, yep bishop g5 boom boom boom. That's it got a knight to d5 now, by the way queen takes c2 here, uh there's a tactical reason why this is not possible, because, basically, you force the queen off of the c file and then you give a fork uh. So smithslav gets the 995.. So that's why? I call this the smithslav idea, okay, and we do exactly the same thing here- just wearing different clothes right: bishop g4, bishop f3. This is how pattern recognition works. Now we get to get a knight to d4. The other knight comes to its aid f5 to stop his ideas, queen a5, to employ the queen a6 to prepare a pawn breaker, which he prevents forgetting that he's weak in the b3 square. Now we literally take everything complete our plan, get the rook to the second, get the other rook into the game. He resigns um. Okay, any questions about this game. Could you discuss queen h4 instead yeah, so queen h4 would also have been possible um. Now I would be a little bit hesitant about putting it on h4, because it's right in the middle of a lot of white pieces and you've got to be a little bit careful about that. You know bishop f2 might become possible, although it is true that you can take the pawn, I'm just not sure how this can be followed up. The queen alone is not going to really create that many chances here and I'm not sure exactly how you can follow this up. Uh can I show the mate I talked about sure. So let's say he does this basically the mate. I talked about nothing extraordinary black to play in this position black to play in this position very simple, so rookie, two yeah rookie, two and rook takes c2 and uh knight both defends the rokin and takes away the only only possible retreat square okay. So that's the entire idea. I was going to show uh very important, continue to look for mating nets, even in the end game. Do not forget to do that after knight, d4 bishop takes. Do we take with the bishop, asks, malcolm tucker, yes, malcolm, so, basically, we, of course we take with the bishop. Nimzovich makes the rather gruesome analogy to a dentist right. A weak square he says is like a cavity, and the reason you don't usually take back with pawns in such situations is because that's like voluntarily, taking your opponent to the dentist and and paying for his cavity being filled. Pawns aren't very good at occupying weak squares because they don't really do anything. It's exactly like a dental filling according to the nymphs. I didn't invent this analogy now. Bishop takes d4, you guys might be like wait, a second didn't. We want a knight on d4. Well, yes, but eventually we're going to get a knight on d4 and the bishop is the next best thing. The bishop is beautiful here as well. Does that make sense now do I am I saying that it's always a bad idea to recapture with a pawn that a pawn is always bad at occupying weak squares? Absolutely not! I can give you guys many exceptions to the rules. Sometimes, for example, uh. You know you take back with a pawn and you vacate or or you cement your control over another weak square. You know there's exceptions, but basically this is a quite a firm rule. When you have a weak square, you want to make sure that pieces occupy that square, not months.
