Let's move on seeking a game and yeah it's taking us longer to find five-minute games. At this level, I've decided that we're going to go approximately until 2500, because I think yeah srp. Thank you van hargraves, okay. Oh we already play this guy uh, so let's go e4 [Music] and he plays the karaoke now against the karaoke. There's many good lines, but one very let's say pure line that I like to showcase is the two knights we just developed both of our knights and he goes bishop g4 brandon. Thank you for the sub. Now against bishop g4, the theoretical continuation is to first play, h3. Okay, he takes on f3 and we get the two bishops. Now. How should we position our pieces? Well, what do you guys think we should do here yeah. We have several possibilities here. Um one possibility is to fianchetto the bishop, so we can actually either play it with d3 or d4. So think of it. This way, if you play d3 that obstructs the diagonal for the bishop, so then we're gonna have to feed and get of the bishop or the move that I like to play is d4, that's simple and it's uh, it's an old-school move now. What should we take with? And now it's time for us to experiment a little bit so taking with the queen protects the pawn, but if we were to play in tall like fashion, we would take with the knight we're going to play this in. In my style, this is not entirely sound, but why are we sacrificing upon? Because we have a lead in development and we have the two bishops and this combination of factors to me, particularly in a blitz game, gives quite a bit of compensation. Also, his queen is stuck in the middle, where it can be assailed by by certain pieces. We can develop a tempo that doesn't mean you immediately. Should I think that black can neutralize my initiative with accurate play, but to play accurately here is certainly not easy at all, and this is again the judgment call that I'm making now. Having said a, you have to say b, as the russian expression goes and b means sacrificing another pawn on b2 um if he takes that pawn, his queen gets even further into my territory, and I can use that okay, so he smartly dips this queen back. But what move is now possible I'll talk about this uh after the game? I'll explain why queen takes b2 is not that good for black. Well now we can castle exactly look. How quickly we're developing. We have pressure down the d-file. You guys should just visually be able to see the compensation okay. Now one of the hardest things about attacking in these positions is finding ways to just keep twisting the knife. So one way to think about it is this. Trades in general are good for him, so this knight on e4. We only have one night left uh, which is why I want to keep it right if he trades the knight, we won't have any like screwdriver pieces. Now we got to think about where we want to put this knight. We don't want to dip it back to c3. That would be passive. So can we find any more active squares for the knight and what I'm not going to tell you guys right now. Is that seeing this move and playing it hinges on seeing a sacrifice, because you guys might look at this and say well, wait a second can't. He chase the knight away with h6, but in this position, because all of our pieces are nicely deployed, you should already be looking for sacrifices and tactical ideas. That should not be a surprise to anyone that these kinds of things already kind of exist. Now it's harder to actually find the type of sacrifice, but the fact that they exist shouldn't be surprised to anybody and h6 weakens the g6. Where we'll get into that after the game, he didn't do it. He went knight, e5, okay, not a problem um. He actually helps us by opening up the default. We just need to find a good square for the queen, and a good square would be somewhere out of the way of the other pieces and g3 comes to mind it's out of the way it doesn't stumble in front of the other pieces, but at the same time it does a lot controls the diagonal and it buttresses the knight, which is an important piece. Let's see if he takes the bishop, we're going to pre-move rook takes d3, um f4 would be a little bit more uh in the face right and it would walk into ideas like 95. Potentially I'm not saying he would have done that, but potentially a queen on f4 would also interfere with the bishop's control of the knight, so, okay, bishop d6. This is another reason why we put the queen on g3, because now we can better deal with this pin. If we put the queen on f4, it would be harder for us to deal with the pen, but we got to be very, very careful. A lot of people, I'm sure, are thinking bishop f4, but bishop f4 walks into knight to h5. That's an important detail to account for so. Instead of bishop f4 uh, we are going to play f4, which is actually not like an ideal move, but at least our pawn now supports the knight, and we continue the initiative in such positions you have to you know you have to keep it going uh. Sometimes the attack won't work out immediately, but if you can keep the pressure on your opponent, if you can keep the foot on the gas pedal eventually something's going to give, and you got to believe that uh- that's why this is also kind of fun, you're you're living on the edge here. I don't think this is entirely objectively sound, but I do believe that my opponent's, eventually going to fold over, let's double the rooks yep, bring the rook into the game. Knight d5, though, is a very strong defensive resource, although I have a response planned for it. Okay, so knight e5. Let's think of this move in terms of its drawbacks. The drawback of the movement d5 is that it weakens the e4 square. Actually so we can dip our knight back to e4, pressuring the bishop on d6. Now you guys might look at this and say well, wait! A second aren't you allowing bishop takes up f4, which is probably what he's going to play, which leads to mass trades, and the short answer is yes. I am, but I've calculated this line a little bit further. So, let's see what happens, we have to trade queens but believe it or not. In my opinion, that's not as big of a problem as it seems because where can a rook now go, we can go rook to d7. I have to give compliments to my opponent, he's playing this like a gm he's playing extremely well he's beating back my attack, but now, in the end game we still have an initiative. We have a rook on the seventh we're two pawns down we're going to win one of the pawns back. He might also capture the pawn on g2, but his knight might get in trouble so um it's it's unclear. We have peace activity. We still have an initiative in the end game, but um. You know this isn't necessarily what I was looking for, but this is also what I talked about. If you keep on keeping on uh, your opponent is eventually going to get tired and that's literally a thing. So what do we want to accomplish in a position like this? Well, ideally, we want both rooks to be on the seventh ring. That's called piggies on the seventh well, can we get that done? Can can we get that done? We can go c4, but there's a problem with c4. He goes knight e3. I want you guys to follow carefully. He goes knight e3 um and then he can potentially come back and take the pawn. So can we prepare the move c4? I know this looks lame, but um and there's several ways to do, but we're gonna go b3 and, in addition to preparing rook d7 um we're also building a potential pawn train. So, even if we don't get our rook to d7 and we do play c4 that pawn on c4 is independently of anything else just going to be protected and when you have these types of end games where both knights are kind of, you know hacking away at each other's pawns. It's a very good idea to make sure that you have as many puns, unprotected protected by other pawns as possible. I don't know if that makes sense, but he doesn't actually prevent us from getting the rook to d7. So, in the end game you can think of the position as a function of two main things: peace, activity and material and people tend to underestimate the role of peace activity. People tend to prioritize counting up the material in the endgame. That's completely understandable, because it is important, but don't forget that peace activity can be an absolute game changer. What do we do now? How do we keep on pressuring his position right? We need to get to his king. What's stopping us from getting to his king? Well, the immediate target is the f pawn, so we can go knight. G5, knight, d6, would have done the same thing now. It is true that he also um. He also is trying to get to our king, but he doesn't have enough firepower to do that, because his f8 rook is passive. He's opened up the a file which is a good thing, but we are ready to take on f7 and cut open, an immediate artery to his king, and then the tactics begin so yeah. I know we're 21 35 we're moving right along making progress. I I never call the knights horses. So rookie is a good move and um. Well, we got to think about whether we want to trade rooks. Do we want to trade rocks and if not, how do we avoid the trade of brooks okay? I gotta make a move guys. I've got no time so rook to c7. We do not want to trade rooks, because we want to keep the piggies on the seventh and we are actually threatening a really cool tactical idea. Does anybody see what white is threatening here? Okay, that's not a problem! Okay, he actually defends so let's go g4 defending the pawn, we're still threatened, I take c6 is correct and if he takes, he gets checkmated. I hope that he lets us. Do it now. The reason we shouldn't be afraid of this is he just doesn't have enough pieces in the attack right. He doesn't have enough to to really do anything to my king and the king. Has this escape route? Should that be necessary, and actually I'm going to exploit that escape route? Watch my king now the king is actually an asset, not a weakness. The king actually kind of like that goalkeeper, which goes in to kick the corner, is now an asset. I'm threatening a similar idea. Oh and now a beautiful idea to win the game. Somebody name it for me bingo. Actually I got to be a little careful. I think I cut this a little bit too close one sec, okay, mate! That's where uh that that's where I come in, you know: don't try this at home. Um! All right, don't try this at home. I got a little bit nervous there. I think I cut it too close when I was trying to get people to find knight, h6, okay um, so he plays the karo khan. Now the karo khan was named after two people, uh ilya khan. I think and horatio cairo. So it's the karo dash con. It wasn't one person and nor do I think they work together. I think cairo and khan sort of independently developed the system and uh kara khan was first played in the year. 1845. caro in 1886 played it, but he was only like the tenther. Oh khan, played it before karo, but before either kara or khan played it. There were a couple of other players who played it. Um some guy named weiss played it five times in 1883 r, climbing. Thank you. So you know again it's one of those things where it's not that people didn't play this before caro and con it's just that they perhaps were the ones that played it most consistently and um. You know, probably they also wrote some sort of treaties on on on the kara khan. So that's why this came to be known as as the karo khan and uh. This is most similar to the french. It's it's what I would call a well it's! Basically, you prepare d5, there's two moves where you prepare d5 and the other one is e6. It's a modern opening and it's very, very popular. It's withstood the test of time and it's a very good opening, um good night- and I don't know yeah, so I decided to play the two knights right, developing both knights. He he goes for the bishop g4 system. His idea is to give up his bishop first and then go e6. Why didn't he go e6 immediately, because then the bishop would be stuck behind the pawn chain. This would be very passive. Thank you, zach miller, priming appreciate it all pawns and no hope is right. The french is not bad. So here I played d4. This is an old school move. I think. Nowadays people tend to prefer g3, bishop g2 and then d3 um. So you, basically you don't claim as much of the center, but the center you do claim is very well protected. So the drawback of d4 is precisely that you can play dxc4. There was a famous fish or tall game in this line. Now queen takes e4 does protect the pawn yeah. The system is viable against the french, but it's not quite as good and uh knight, f6 yeah. So if he goes bishop h5 there is a very sharp line where basically white gets a big initiative by giving a check and slamming the knight into e5. This line is uh considered to be very dangerous for black. Although there's a lot of theory here, I don't want to delve into that, but that's why he took on f3. Thank you dragon transformer another sub with the prim um, but I decided to play knight txt4 so from a purely objective perspective. This is not a very sound sacrifice, although it's not bad um, I think it's not terribly unsound either, but um after knight f6, our opponent lets us develop a tempo and now we castle- and here actually I'm not sure about the move that I played knight g5. I was kind of attracted to the idea of sacking on e6, but I think that it would have been better to be prophylactic, so our opponent wants to go 95. Oh yeah, queen takes b2. Sorry I forgot about that. So if queen takes b2, we simply castle- and I just want you guys to visually- compare the development of white in the development of black. Thank you. Moksha nirvana for the 300 right white's got literally everything developed black has virtually nothing developed and once I go, rook b1 on rook takes b7. Black is just basically going to get trackmated, even if like manages to castle short, it actually won't matter because of the firepower that white has here. Really it isn't about the pawns. All pawns are no hope, as one wise man said. Does that make sense? So again we can delve into the detail here, but you guys should really just see this from a visual perspective. Above all else, so he jumped dips back, and here I actually think I was invasion. Now our opponent wants knight to e5. He wants to trade off this bishop on d3, which is sort of a very important cog in the machine. Could you guys propose a move whereby I can both prevent 95, but to do so, while also improving my position in a tangible way, three bucks from a zenith, sound bite. Thank you! Well I'll I'll have to do that later after the speed run concludes so bishop c4 is possible, queen g3, very good, move and uh, as is yeah good job, guys, bishop d4, also good, because that would centralize the bishop, okay, that would centralize 547. If I look at that, that's a sexy number, if I may say so, myself so yeah that would have been good. I kind of missed this move to be honest. Now, if he played h6, this weakens the g6 square and there's a very thematic idea. Actually, gary gaspara once fell into this against deep blue and just look at how bad the king badly the king is placed. We can bring the rook into the game and x-ray the king black can very easily get checkmated in a position like this now I know a lot of people are looking at this and saying wait a second. Why not bishop c5- and this is a piece of advice. I have everybody, be very careful very, very careful not to underestimate the amount of pieces that you are giving away in return for the queen. Okay, this is something I see all the time like. You'll people will find some crazy sequence of work, I'm winning and then they'll give up two rooks and three pieces and five pawns for the queen right there. You can collect sufficient material for the queen, and this is a case of that. You have a rook in two pieces for the queen and white white's attack kind of fizzles out. There's no need for this. It's much better to just accumulate, prepare slowly attack fast, rather than do something like that. Okay um! Well! No, I didn't have this idea here, first and foremost, because actually maybe I did actually that's not so bad no, but he can move his queen away. This is actually funny because if I take c6, you can do this, but the same thing applies here: black is a million pieces for the queen, so this isn't that good yeah, so queen g3 instead, bishop d6 is a very good move. Now, if bishop f4, knight h5 forks the bishop and the queen, leading to a lot of problems, yeah- and I gotta attribute that to my coach lap size, so we go f4 and actually here I think there was a critical moment. So queen c7 is good and now knight d5 super annoying, and this is a very typical thing in the car con that happens right. He gets this stronghold on d5, which shuts down the d file. I have to reopen the default knight. E4 gets the knight back to a relatively civilized square and we attack g7. We basically force the transition into the end game now, if you take it on e3 first, who can tell me why this doesn't like win a lot of material? What is the important detail here? Knight takes, d6 is correct, followed by queen takes c3 and white wins a p. So that's an important detail now in the end game white. Just to reiterate the the sort of the fact that white is down two pawns is is compensated by the fact that y has the rook on d7. I have control over the d file and uh. His rooks are very very passive. Now, when you turn on the computer, it gives a hefty advantage for black, but I would argue, I would have the audacity to argue that the reality is uh from a blitz perspective. From a practical perspective, this is a difficult position to play for black and I think you guys saw that manifest itself in the game. It's very hard. The computer knows exactly. You know how to wiggle his its way out of things and computer is never afraid of peace activity. The humans are, and they should be so knight t5- is already inaccurate. According to the computer, which greedily prefers b6, not an easy move to play, because basically you're supposed to allow this to happen and just trade one pair of rocks, rook 88, you know it all seems very obvious. It's like my game against l, shot right uh. When you look at the game with a computer, you think you're an idiot really, and this persists all the way to the gm level. So it's a little bit depressing to do that. Take the computer suggestions of the grain of salt, no you're, not an idiot you're, not dumb. It's just that computers are so much better than humans ever will be, in my opinion, it's important to analyze with a computer insofar as it reveals mistakes, but you should certainly not take it as a sign that you suck or anything like that, because you do suck and I suck and magna sucks and we all suck in comparison to computers. That doesn't mean we don't want to improve. Okay- and I didn't really follow my own advice, because I hold myself to very high standards, but you guys should not do that to the same extent that I do it my opinion. The knight t5 rook, takes b7 castles. Now c4 would meet with knight e3 right and I didn't want to give away a pawn for nothing, even though we do get a rook to d7. So that's why we play b3 preparing the move, c4 and building up a punch chain at this point already um he's in trouble, rook d7, getting the knight to g5. Why are we not worried that he opens up the afl because he doesn't have the other rook and with only a rook and a knight, he can't create any chances. Now knight takes c6 here. How does this idea work? So if ftxd6, this is a concept everybody should commit to memory. This mating idea is very common when you've got piggies on the seven. Thank you joshua all day, but the problem is what what does black have in this position? Yeah, I could have considered that goran zarge. That would have led to some really interesting complications, but he first takes g2. He defends the pawn preemptively. Now he takes e6. That is why I had to play g4. Now we have to escape the potential for discovery very patiently. Wiggling the king to c5. Now I can't take on e6, but I can take on f7 and knight takes h6 check is exactly the same concept if he takes check, check and checkmate. At this point we got into some time pressure, but the win is very straightforward: g5 to defend the knight win, one pawn get the night over well, I could have taken the rook here, but it didn't matter I'm completely winning at this point winning the rook and I actually managed to preserve reasonably good technique despite the time pressure. So I was um. I was quite happy with that, but uh you guys can see how quickly black's position deteriorated in that end game. So what's the lesson from this? The lesson is, you shouldn't automatically rule out an endgame, even when you're down a bunch of pawns right uh, because there are certain end games where the piece activity disparity is so vast that you might be even down three pawns. I can show you examples. You might be down a whole piece and yet the and that's rare, admittedly, but the disparity in peace activity is sometimes equally important, if not more important than the material account. Thank you not danny19, loving the uh, the hype, almost at 3 500, amazing stuff, guys yeah, so rook behave in this position. Well then yeah, maybe rook b would have been actually not so bad, but but we would have got knight c5 and he has a hard time defending these pawns um and any questions any other questions about this game. I think it was a complicated game, but hopefully I made everything relatively clear. Okay looks like we're pretty clear: let's play one more, you guys are ready for the next one and oh damos, 1289 gifting five. Thank you, my friend damos 1289, raising that hype with the subs and let's play king's indian. Let's go back to uh my home base, let's play king's indian and he plays what's called the tory attack. The tory attack is a similar opening to the london system, where black white develops to f4 and in the tory white simply develops the g5. It's similar in spirit to the london white does many of the same things, and logically, black also does many of the same things. So the great thing about the king's indian, the reason I recommend it to a lot of players is that you don't really have to modify your set of moves depending on what your opponent does uh, which is not to say it's not theoretical. But if you understand the ideas, you can react reasonably to most things your opponent can throw at you theo 25k. So what do the king's indian moves basically look like here? What should we do now? Should we go d5? That would be more grunfeld style, not really. If we want to preserve the king's india any ness of it, we should go d6 and, as I've explained previously in the king's indian, black has two main pawn breaks, c5 and e5 in the toure. One of the ideas is that white discourages e5 because he puts the bishop on g5 preemptively. Does it make sense guys that white's going to have this nasty pin if we go e5? So let's not fall into his plan? Let's actually punt on this. Let's table that conversation by finishing our development. First, let's look at this bishop for a second: where can it go? Thank you archdruid and tenacious. Where can this bishop go? What would be a nice juicy weighty square for that bishop, not g4 if it goes to g4 guys he's just going to take it away with h3 we're actually going to fiance in the interest of time, I'm going to make the move we're going to fee and get of the bishop and we're going to talk about this moment after I don't expect people to just like know this stuff uh. Now he wants to go a5, so we're going to go a5 ourselves to prevent him from doing that, and now we're going to develop the knight d7. We don't want to develop it to c6 to obstruct the bishop. Now he builds up a little battery here. Can we blunt that battery for now yeah he's six now wait a second! I hear you guys saying, but doesn't that open up the pin? Well, it does, but guess what that's not such a dangerous spin. We can get rid of it by playing g5. If we need to I'm not saying we'll do that immediately, we can also get rid of the pin by moving the queen, and here I'm going to show you guys a really really cool idea, really whoa big for raid 127. We were doing holy smokes. We had a dono chest, jacob 100 bucks wow. Are you kidding me and we are going to go g5, let's get rid of the pen thinking bigfoot for the raid. I can't even keep up with this. This is unbelievable levels of support, guys what a raid, what a dono welcome, guys we're doing the speedrun. Thank you so much jess jacob. How do we follow this move up? How do we get rid of this bishop yeah? That h5 is the typical follow-up I'll show you guys the cool idea afterwards, it didn't quite work here, but I'll show you guys afterwards. This is amazing guys. I I not the way I played today. I didn't earn it, but I really appreciate it nonetheless, now what is going to be our strategy? Our strategy here, broadly speaking, is going to be to accumulate pieces on the king's side. That's all we're going to do. Let's get our queen to f6 slowly, but surely we're going to accumulate pieces on the queen side and eventually you know at some point in the very distant future we're going to try to play 5.. Now the situation has changed. He goes e5. He doesn't actually win upon. Why doesn't he win upon? What can we do here? What very important intermediate move does black have to play, because if we take on d6, we actually drop the pawn, but we take the bishop, that's partially, why we played knight h5, we take the bishop, and now we take the pawn we're in pretty decent shape here. He's actually playing super super. Well, this guy um. Our position is a little bit precarious. Black has some weaknesses, but we also have the two bishops: let's get the knight over to f6. Again, our plan is to accumulate pieces on the king's side and eventually we're going to launch into an attack now. One thing I'm noticing here is that when he took on g3 with the pawn he weakened that h file, so a potential idea is to go queen h5 knight, g4. We don't have to do that immediately, but in fact we actually can. Let's get the knight to g4. I don't see a downside to this move. Uh notice that when I play queen h5, I'm not going to be threatening queen h2, but his knight on f3 is going to be charged with a very heavy load and we're going to start looking for some overloading tactics to try to get that knight out of f3. Also, don't forget about the bishop. That's why we fianchetto did it's occupying a really big diagonal, literally holy smokes 30 on top of the 100 by chess jacob. We got 30 subs, ladies and gentlemen, that propels us over 5500 subs, my land girl. This is crazy. Let's trade, the knights, absolutely unbelievable! Thank you! So much chess jacob. This is incredible. Now we're gonna start pushing the puns. We're gonna try to tear apart the defenses around his king amazing. Thank you so much 50 over 5500. Now we're gonna go rook ba. Why did we play this move? Why did we play rook b8 and in the interest of time, I'm accelerating my pace a little bit here, but I want somebody on top of that flowner with a sub we're going to shut him down with d5. Somebody needs to give that man a sub. Thank you, chess jake. I really appreciate it. Man we needed to protect v6 and we did that indirectly he's not a sub unacceptable. Okay, now what happens if he takes the pawn on v6? This is where things get a little bit gnarly and complicated, but I'll walk you guys through this properly after the game. The bottom line is we're still trying to attack on the king side and we're going to do that by pushing the pawns and trying to open up trying to deal with tommy gifting to chess jacob trying to deal with his own pawns on the king's side. That's going to let us pave the way for our pieces to come in and start attacking. So how specifically, should we go about ripping this apart? This is an idea that I mentioned previously. Let's not forget about it. What was our initial idea? I said that we'd do this eventually yeah f5 f4, let's go now. This is not that simple right, because we're weakening the e6 square and that's a pretty serious weakness that we've created it's right in the crosshairs of his rook. So a good move for him would be bishop d3, but I've judged that I'm going to you know kind of like an nfl blitz, I'm going to blitz this pawn up the board and I've made the judgment. Call that he's not going to have the time to exploit the newly created weakness of e6. I don't know if that makes sense. That's basically my logic, because I'm right on the doorstep of playing f4 and when I do, I just feel like his king is not going to survive very much longer and I can always defend. E6 worst comes to wars. By dipping my bishop to c8 bat, you know bad bishops defend good pawns. He plays that for himself. Now, how should we should we take on passant I'll? Give you guys a hint? We actually don't have to he closed one freeway. He closed one freeway, but let's open the other freeway we can take the other freeway. We can take the h file. Here's the thing in a certain sense follow my logic. Here. It's actually a good thing. It's actually a good thing that he locked up the entire center, because this lets us fully focus on the other side of the board. Now we can divert all of our resources to the h-file, including the bishop, to h6 the queen to h4, and we don't have to worry about anything happening in the center, at least for the time being, and I've actually just missed this move um, I actually completely forgot. I could do that. That's okay! You've got to be able to recover in these situations. What do we do? You know what we do? Nothing we just, let's first go queen h6 and here's what I've come up with here's, what I've come up with what we're okay! Well, I've come up with winning his knight. He should have defended that pun. This is the point I always make, though, when you put your opponent under pressure throughout the game, he gets tired and it that increases the probability of a blunder. I'll explain what I would have done if he had defended the plan. I actually did miss king f2 to be completely fair. We have won a knight- let's not relax too soon, because he can finally take his six, it's kind of funny. It's fitting that he has finally taken the pun, but he's done it at the cost of a night and his entire king side has collapsed. Okay, um. Thank you again. Chess jacob for the 30 gifted we've had so many bombs today. So much support so many donors, and I really really appreciate it guys. We are on the path to 6 000 subs. I cannot freaking believe it now, I'm looking at this bishop and I'm saying man, I really want this bishop on e3. That square would be really sexy. Can we get that bishop to e3? We can't play bishop h6 right, wait a minute. Can we get the bishop to h6? We can you ask the sam shanklin question: what happens if I do it anyway? Okay, we're definitely gonna trade queens to simplify right. What happens if I do it anyway. If he had taken that rook, we would have had a fork with queen e3 I'll show this after the game, um and and- and that really is something I advocate for players of all levels. Uh gm's and you know all of my students receive a healthy dose of this suggestion. Basically, at all times now again, we've got some time pressure, so we just need to move the bishop away dip the kink to h8 so that we can, if necessary, block it with rook h7. Let's bring our bishop back, he's probably going to give us a check, we're gonna go here. I actually believe it or not. I did blunder. That's the funny thing. I blundered because uh I have to go rook g7. I forgot this bishop was hanging okay and so did he, but uh he's gonna lose on time. Sorry about that in the end nobody's perfect, however, so another very rich game. These people are playing very very well, so he played the tory attack. The tory attack was named after carlos torre mexican one of the strongest players to come out of mexico uh. I think he basically flourished in the first half of the 20th century and the first guy to play. This was a guy named coleman in 1923., eugene coleman who lost against richard retti and remember I mentioned retsy retsy was one of the hyper modernists. He was one of those guys in the 1920s who basically said um. You don't have to play uh. He was a check check player. He said you don't have to control the center of your puns. It ain't a surprise to anybody that um that it shouldn't be a surprise to me that that reti was playing the king's indian in the 1920s when it was still unpopular, but then um tori himself did he actually ever play the tory in this move order. Let me see um it's one of those things. You know. Yeah tori did play it, oh, but I think it's named after yokanyotory. Okay. This is really really interesting guys. So tori refers to two players: carlos torre from mexico, and much more recently, eugenio torre eugenio cherry from the philippines. One of the strongest grandmasters in the philippines he's still alive he's in his 60s. I never knew this, but I think the tory attack is named after eugeniotori from the philippines, not carlos torre um. It was around before eugenio, but I think he's I see he's played it like over 20 times, so I actually think it's named after him and not carla story, pretty interesting. That's a pretty recent thing, but anyway, nice little piece of trivia, bishop g5, similar to the london castles, bishop c4. So normally in the tory white develops the bishop I think to d3 or e2. Bishop c4 is a slightly unusual way of developing and d5 would be possible here with tempo, but we wanted to keep the king's indian-ness of the line so b6 to deploy the bishop. Now, why is bishop g4 not effective? Who can explain this to me succinctly? Why is bishop g4? Why I mean? Usually we develop our bishop that why? All of a sudden did I reject this natural developing square exactly he goes h3 and the problem guys when we fianchetto our bishop. This bishop that we put on this diagonal doesn't have a retreat square. So we allow him to trap the bishop and we would either have to take on f3, doesn't make sense or bring the bishop back. Thank you super scrub. So for that reason we fianchetto division, a45 and e6 to blunt the battery now h6 and now I decided to just get rid of the pin: g5 not h1. Now a little bit of decision logic. How did I decide that it was worth weakening the king side in this way, like? Isn't this very weakening to go g5 um? Well, as I've explained previously, the main aspect of the logic that I use is to figure out. Okay, does white? Have the capacity in the next couple of moves to exploit the weakness of the king side, and what do I notice his queen is on the queen side, his bishop's on the queen side. Most of his pieces are in some way clustered on the queen side, which means it's going to take him a long time to get them back to the king side and in that time I'm going to bring the beef to the king side, which I do on the next move. Does that make sense? So here e takes d6, we take on g3 and now we begin what was the cool idea. So basically I had this idea and I will show you guys a example in a similar position of where I applied this idea in one of my games. It's my favorite opening it's! You know people ask me about my favorite opening. Sometimes I roll my eyes with that question, but if I had to choose it would definitely be the king's indian. So you guys can see this game the story behind this game. This is uh in this tournament in london in december. It's very cold. I got very, very sick in this tournament, so I remember I had the flu and at the time this game was played, I started getting that sore throat. You guys know when you get sick. I always it always starts with a sore throat for me and the pain was getting excruciating. I mean I was playing and I was in agonizing pain. I couldn't swallow um, but in this game I was feeling that fever rising up and I was basically playing a whole game delirious, but nonetheless I managed to apply the idea. This is only round one. It says round two, but basically this is round one and then I actually did okay in the tournament. Given how sick I was but uh this game, I actually played quite well and then I ran to my room and took all the medicine I could find, but it didn't help my throat okay, so this idea is involves improving the queen I'll, give you guys a hint. You build a battery like the ultimate end goal of this idea, which is two moves. Long is to build a battery. Now what kind of battery yeah I was freezing, and then I went all around these indian restaurants trying to get the spiciest curry to knock it out. Bingo rook, a2 quinn, a1, very typical idea by the way, and ultimately the idea is to build this battery along the long diagonal which can be used to pressure it now. Ultimately it wasn't that simple. I got my queen back. You know I re-maneuvered my pieces, but look at how now the queen and the bishop are very nicely supervising the queen side pressure. I actually ended up playing a very, very nice game here and um. That's the bottom line idea. Yeah I've been on the whole time, but um I've been doing. I went away for a little bit and um. I will be playing blitz as well and feeling more energetic now, so that was the bottom line uh. But why didn't I do this here? The reason I didn't do this here coming back to our speed run scene is that um? I was a little bit worried of him. Essentially rushing his pawn down the board or he could go bishop d3, and I was not quite able to detect how I would apply more pressure on the pawn, but this this this has its time in place, but I thought this idea was quite a bit sexier. So now the next stage of the game begins where we accumulate pieces on the king side and we use our pawns as battering rams to shatter the defenses around his king. How do I know that I need to attack here? Well, I've already gotten my queen here, and I know that this bishop has a tremendous amount of potential energy tremendous amount of potential energy, and I know that if I'm able to open up files I'll be able to use these pieces to my advantage, so h5 rook a b8. Now this move indirect defense of the pawn. What happens if queen takes b6? What specifically does black do in this position? Well, we got something: five bucks, not danny 19. Thank you. My friend bishop takes g2 would be a very good move, killing two birds with one stone winning a pawn and removing one of the defenders around his king take the juicer. Now we go d5, we keep the bishop on v7. Now, doesn't this close down the bishop? It does, but I judged that ultimately, the bishop would be able to reroute via c8 or via a6. I wasn't too worried about this, so g4 here comes the f-plan. So let's um talk about my mistake now. Basically, this move queen h4, was very hasty. This move was very hasty. I just forgot that he can bring his king to f2 now what should we have done in this position? Instead um. I think that I should have re redid my move order here. It's actually not that simple. This idea of king f2 is quite an annoying one. I actually think that I rushed. I didn't practice what I preached now, if you guys know if you got yeah bishop h6 preemptively. This is a very savvy move, because if he plays king f2 now we take on g3 and he can't take with the knight. Yes, he has to take with the king, and at this point black has a lot of different tactical ideas. We can consider a bishop sack, but whatever we do this, this king is oh, oh, my god, I just saw something. I use the word sexy and I mean it here. King g7 creates a beautiful threat. I think this works black to play and win black to play and win okay. Let's let people, let's let people think the non-title players, queen h4 and bishop f4, there's no defense. I think against rook h8 checkmate and if knight bishop f5 rock f6, though check you sack one rook and you checkmate with the other one. That's actually quite a beautiful idea. I'm not sure this actually works, but um it's uh! Oh bishop takes f5 actually more. No, this wins. This actually wins wow amazing. So that would have been quite the nice end to the game and I just checked with the engine, but he ended up blundering the pawn. He should have gone queen d2 defending and he actually gets the rook to h1 and actually white is more or less fine. Here I was going to reroute my bishop and put it on h4. You get kind of some tension down the h5, I'm not sure who benefits from it. So this would have been quite complicated. I should not have allowed it, but all's well that ends well. He blunders the pawn and the piece comes with it and that's how we won. Ultimately, our attack succeeded and we were able to stave off his central pressure and and that basically uh. You know that is basically that [Music].
