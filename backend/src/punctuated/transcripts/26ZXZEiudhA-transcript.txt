[Music], okay game: two cracker atm: let's go e4 this time and I'm going to disable the alerts. While I play the games, if that makes sense, because when I put this on youtube um, when I put this on youtube people like it, when there's like uh uh, you know a specific kind of people like the flow. I still. This does not diminish my appreciation for the support and I'll re-enable them like after each game, so he's playing the scandy he's playing the scandigo, d4 and um. Basically, the queen d6 line is legitimate. That is a variation of the scandy that rose to prominence recently, but the way that we play this isn't really substantively different from other scandies. We just develop our pieces and control the center. There's nothing crazy that we have to do here, but um. You know we have to be very careful because he's immediately applying pressure on the pawn. What is his next move going to be, and how should we deal with that move? What is his? What is his general scheme of development here so he's clearly applying pressure on the pawn? Which means? What does he want to do? He wants to go bishop g4 and the sort of russian school of chess move is what well d I'll explain d5 after the game, but I'm a little bit worried that pawn will be insurable. Let's go h3, not a move, I love to play, but it really annoys the hell out of people. Ah now I can't put the bishop here and putting the bishop okay. Now he goes a6, but I didn't even really want to put the bishop on b5. Where should we put the bishop? Where can we put the bishop now now that we've dealt successfully with his main idea? We can develop actively, and that involves a move like bishop c4 and now, if we're thinking about pushing our pawn to d5 at some point, it's easier to do that now we're just going to castle and where should this bishop go and we've been through this many times? This is like the natural classic square. We just bring our pieces into the game. Yeah black can play e5 yeah. Bishop g5 is right. Bishop e3 would be slightly more passive, although a case could be made for that as well. Now, um we're gonna make another. Well, he wants to play rook d8. We still have to be very careful about protecting this pawn. At the same time, I'm not too worried about that. What I am slightly worried about is the move b5. I don't want to let him go b5 with tempo and then fianchetto his bishop. So how can we stop? Can we stop that we're we're kind of playing prophylactically this game, trying to annoy him? Let's go a4 exactly. This is a common move at like a gm level. You'll see this all the time in various positions and if he goes rookie, which I think he will. Yes, he does um. This is not a problem. What we really want to accomplish here. I've talked about this many times. The best way to defend the pawn is with another pawn. So it would be very nice if we could play c3 and freaking forget about this problem once and for all. How can we go about doing that, while not blundering the pawn in the first place? Yes, we could go 92. This knight could re-maneuver to g3 a slightly more active square and as necessary we could play the move. C3. Okay, so queen b4 is one of those moves that looks intimidating, but I don't believe it really is because the reality is queen takes b2 is going to be. You know it's going to be unthinkable, so we can go bishop b3, but then he might go knight a5 and keep harassing us. So, let's see, if we can defend this bishop with something can we kill both problems at once, yeah we can just go b3, we can go b3, we don't have to even worry about queen takes b2 and if he goes knight a5, the bishop can drop to d3 and aim itself at the king. So the queen on b4 is kind of stuck in no man's land. We can take on e7. We can also drop the bishop to d2. Either. Move is good. Let's take. Let's simplify a little bit, leaving him with a bad bishop, and now, let's involve our rook and x-ray, the queen, discouraging him from playing e5, and we can then bring our knight out to g3, which we're gonna do and kind of complete the x-ray slightly better for white here he goes queen f6. Where can this knight go from here? Where can this knight go from? What would be a nice pathway for the knight who can tell me yep, knight, e4, excellent and white, is slightly better here, nothing extraordinary. He plays he's playing well queen h6 and from here he could go to c5, but we shouldn't necessarily rush with that, although that is very tempting, so I'm gonna do it. Although he can go back to c8 here and uh he's doing fine, but we're gonna start piling up on him. What does it mean to pile up? We need to look at the center. We need to ask ourselves. Well. Are there squares that we can access in the center for our pieces? What comes to mind? What squares can we jump onto? Well? He goes b6, so all right. So that is interesting. We could consider taking this funnel, though I don't love that what we're gonna do instead, let me think about this is: let's drop the knight back to d3 so that we can go to e5 so notice, I'm doing all these maneuvers, it might seem mysterious. What I'm essentially trying to do is optimize the placement of my pieces, I'm trying to find the best central squares for my pieces and the move. B6 is something that hopefully we're going to make him pay for he's. Creating these. You know these weaknesses on the queen side and eventually, one day, hopefully we'll be able to exploit them now, which knight do we want to put on e5 uh? That depends on what he does, although I like putting the f knight so that the queen has access to the king side squares in case. We want to get started on an attack uh. The perk of putting the other knight on e5, which is what we're gonna do here, is that the bishop can then drop back to d3, which is what we're gonna do and aim itself once again at the king, okay and now look his position is getting more passive. Oh and he's missed a very nice retreat for the night. Where can we go and what immediately do I think of when I play f6? Is this the pawn on e6? Look how weak it is. So what we need to be doing is bringing the knight back with tempo. His queen is almost trapped. Okay, oh he goes here and now we can just take the pawn and once that pawn falls, his whole position is going to start collapsing. We are actually threatening something really really cool. I'm anticipating this move, I'm anticipating bishop, f, okay, he goes f5 and he doesn't defend against it. Look very carefully at the queen. It has no squares. Can we attack it? Yes, we can g3 traps the queen, the rook on e6, guardian d6, the knight's defending against the other squares he's gonna have to give his queen up for two pieces. That's actually really cool, so you can see the pressure rookie 4. He had d6. So that's why we put the rook on e6 not only to take the pawn, but also to deprive the queen of that square all right. So we put the pressure on okay, so knight c3. We shouldn't panic. Gonna move like this. We should ask ourselves, oh so he finds a defense, but the reality is he does it at a great cost to his position. Now, if we were to move the queen, he'd take the knight, so let's take his queen and the funny thing is. We now need to find a way to win the maximum amount of material. So what should we do here? What we should do is realize that both knights are hanging. Okay, both knights are hanging. What does that mean with my turn? That means, if we were to move this knight away, then he would not be able to save both knights at once, which is what we're going to do. We're going to go knight g to e5, we're not going to take any of his knights, because then he would take hours and attack the other knight and now we're going to win the knight and if he goes, knight d5, which he's probably going to do we're going to pin that knight with bishop c4. Now, let's simply activate our pieces knight to g5 we're going to go for checkmate here, even though it's an end game once again, look at the amount of pieces that are next to his king. This knight wants to go to e6 and then we're going to take g7. The game is basically over yeah, so things are getting more complicated but we're following the same logic that we've always followed. None of my moves should be like that mysterious. So a move like bishop c4 involves some tactical vision. He's put his knight on the same diagonal as his king. So now we can do a bunch of different things. We can go rook, d7 yeah, we're going to do that, because the reality is. If he takes on d7, then we take. Then we take on d5 and attack his rook on a8. So there's some tactics. None of them are whole. You know unbelievably difficult here, for example. What should we do here? You know we should notice that the rook on a will be hanging if we take d5. What should we take d5 with, and we should just take just safety. Five and bishop takes or rook takes, would also be fine. Here we can take either rook, it really doesn't matter. I should play a little bit fast because I'm low on the clock and he resigns great game. Okay, so he played the scandy and queen d6 has gotten quite popular lately. Even a book has been written about it and now h3 to stop bishop g4 uh we're just developing our pieces. White is slightly better here. A4 stopping b5, now knight e2 right. A lot of people would look at this move and say, and it's a retreating move. I don't really want to retreat we're at the level when you can't think that superficially, retreating moves can be perfectly fine, and I've made that point for a very long time. So we want to play c3 ultimately to permanently secure the pawn on d4. So this knight could get relieved of its duty and come to g3, okay, so queen b4 now b3. If we had gone bishop b3, he goes knight a5. He attacks the bishop and if we move the bishop we have to deal with queen takes b2, that's kind of annoying okay, so b3 knight d5. We take on e7, leaving him with kind of a passive bishop. Now we go rookie one x-raying his queen knight, g3 94, knight c5, like just improving our pieces and now knight back to d3. So the reason we don't take his bishop is there's no need to do that. Our knight is good. His bishop is bad, that's a simple cost-benefit analysis and it helps him get his rooks to the d-file. Thank you. Jtm waffle, um, there's no other good square for the knight. So again, it's technically a retreating move, but really it's not because we want to reroute the knight to e5, which is exactly what we do. So he goes knight c7. We go knight, d5. The reason I didn't play knight fv5. I I mentioned that we might play this move, but the bishop is kind of stranded here and um. I didn't want to leave it strandy. It's like b5 idea is kind of nasty. Why didn't we take a6? So that is, I wouldn't say, that's a free pawn, because let's approach this and like what is my intuition today, what is my brain telling me? My brain is telling me look. This knight is stranded that should make sense to everybody. The knight is no way back and what he can do is he can just defend the c7 pawn and guess what I don't want to deal with this just for a pawn like who knows if I'm going to get my knight out, maybe I am, I don't think he's going to win the night, but this leads to complications that are not worth a pawn. Pawns are just like not that valuable in the grand scheme of things in the middle game- and I didn't want to engage in this, particularly in a blitz game and by the way, as xcsme points out yeah bishop c. It needs to be dealt with, but we can take the knight and open up this evacuation route: okay, okay, so nice, d5, bishop e8. Now we go bishop d3, aiming the bishop at the king and the move. F6 is the decisive mistake um? How did I immediately know what to look for? Well again, I often mention formative games in my chess career, where I committed mistakes, similar to what my opponent does, and there was a game that I have previously shared in the context of a funny story um, but that game itself has instructed value. I've made this very similar mistake: myself: okay, it's not like I'm immune to this kind of stuff and my 2700 rated plus opponent failed to perceive this exact type of weakness. Okay, so watch this I'm going to find this game and I'm going to show you it's my game against dimitri jakovenko. Who is a russian super grand master, and I literally made, I would say, a very, very similar, slightly more complicated version of it, but a very similar mistake: yakovenko 2737. I've shared this game before 2015., so, basically as as black here, I was like I'm annoyed as hell at this knight, I'm gonna chase the night away with f6 okay rebel. Thank you for the stuff and I failed to appreciate. I failed to appreciate that um that I'm weakening the e6 pawn because in my mind I was ah the bishop's defending it, but guess what the bishop it turns out is. Overloaded white has a very simple overloading tactic that my opponent also missed, because it doesn't often occur at like the gm level. People don't usually blunder this kind of stuff. So what is white's move and people are going to see this very quickly. The bishop is overloaded, it has two jobs. Both of them are very weighty, so knight takes c6 and let's say black plays rook takes c6, it doesn't matter and eventually you go. Queen takes e6. You've won a second pawn and you win. The bishop and white is completely winning. Why does two pawns up black can win one of them, but now after rook a2 everything is protected, a6 is going to collapse, black's pieces are scattered and black is just lost here. It's not quite resignable, but white would have won this. My opponent after thinking for like five minutes, goes knight back to d3. Well, it's not that simple, but I'm sorry, but like this is a game between the 2700 2600. Everybody should follow at least the principle here. So I've done this before the same exact type of mistake, and I really want to emphasize that, even though the close might be different, the sort of type of mistake is exactly the same, so be very careful about weakening those central pawns. That's yeah! We laughed our asses off exactly that's the ultimate goal here: knight g4 rook takes c6 and now detecting the queen queen is trapped and we simply go g3, attacking it and trapping it. Okay, what if he did f6 before 97.? So if he did have six here, then there was no way to win the pawn directly. But it's okay. I mean we could have gotten the queen e2 or I don't know, rookie four okay, childhood blender's a fork on c3, so uh. We could have done something like this and and centralized the queen uh yeah. He could have gone knight, c3 and forced the exchange of queens, but that exchange of queens is not necessarily horrible for me. So I don't know there's details here, but um. The bottom line is the bottom line. Is this is like the the arc of the game? How do we see that the queenest chapter well, we've had games before we've had games before where we trap the queen sort of in the center of the board in the middle game, and you should not exclude that possibility, even if the queen may seem safe, but I I can see that the queen is surrounded by a lot of traffic. There's a lot of pieces in the vicinity of the queen, no gm neroditsky coaching at gmail.com and that sort of alerts me to the possibility that the queen might be out of breath out of air and so g3 uh traps the queen, okay, so yeah. It just looks: trapped and rookie four doesn't trap the queen, as some people asked, because the queen has the d6 square, although that's very close, all right any questions or maybe may we move on to perhaps the final game of speedrun. Today, as I said, this is a bit of a short stream. Well, bishop f7 doesn't actually oh yeah. He goes knight c3, and here we just go 95. We transformed the advantage into winning a knight. He found a way to get his queen saved, but um. He loses a piece in the end game and that's just a disaster. Oh yeah c5. Sorry, he could have gone c5 and opened this up. I missed that yeah, yeah, yeah, c5 or c6. I mean it's still miserable, but you're you guys are right. Good job, yeah, c5 or c6, and the queen has evacuation squares on b and c7, but I can go c4 and dislodge one night from the other. Thank you wasted and wounded for the two months. 2205 miguel tall. Okay, that's a pretty intimidating name, all right. Let's go with another: let's go with the modern um and I played the modern increasingly just to show how these hyper modern openings are played. Thank you symphony and, basically, to reiterate what we're trying to do here is. We are giving white control of the center. Yes, we are, but then we're using our pieces as snipers from a distance to chip away at that center and attack it with our pieces and then with our pawns at some point. So that doesn't mean we don't need to complete our development. We need to complete our development and he goes bishop c4. Now bishop c4, as we've discussed on several occasions, there is a small tactical idea here that um can allow us to liquidate and sort of simplify the position and actually equalize. Could somebody remind me of what that idea is and- and you should think about this whenever there's a bishop on c4 knight on c3? Those are the contours of this tactic. Knight takes c4 and then d5 winning back the piece okay, so he goes bishop f7, that's an intermediate move. People often play, but it's not actually that good, because it gives us the f-file and it gives us the two bishops. However, our king side is slightly weakened, so that's the rationale behind it. Now this knight. We need to be careful, because this knight can go to g5 and cause us some problems. We have a weak square on e6 so before we do anything crazy, we need to take care of the passageway of this knight to g5 and e6. What move allows us to do that? Yeah now you guys might look at this move and say: well. Aren't you weakening your king's side even further? We kind of are but it's more important to prioritize stopping nitro5 than anything else. Right now and now we can continue our development, so we can play. We can play a lot of different things. We can now play d5, actually control more of the center and get this knight out of e4 permanently if we do weaken the e5 square, but we can control that square effectively by getting getting our knight out quickly and perhaps even at some point playing the move e5 to fully liquidate that weakness. Okay, knight c5, is a really good move, because his knight can swing back to d3. We don't need to play b6 here, uh, because that would actually help him. We can actually just continue our development with knight, c6 and uh. Then we can bring our queen out to add some more beef to the protection of the five square. Well, this is beef. This is like filet mignon that he just gave us and that's the thing you know when people are up against these unorthodox positions, they tend to make more blunders, which is why, at this level, I do recommend people to look into openings like the modern okay. So queen d6 here falls into our plans and it protects g6 and now, by the way we can go b6 and get the night out, because the knight no longer has access to the d to the d3 square. Now we have an extra piece, but let's not relax. Let's try to let's try to play precisely what does it mean to play precisely? We haven't completed our development, okay, just to remind people of the importance of completing your development, even when you're up a piece, bishop f5 is a perfectly fine move. We just got to be a little bit careful about a rook which is sort of stranded. It does have the e4 square though, but we just got to pay a little bit of attention to it. It is defended now I'm looking at this knight on b3 and I'm saying we need to use our pawns to open up the queen side. How do we do that? We have a very, very thematic maneuver here that knight on b3 is a sitting duck it's a sitting duck because we can advance our pawn to a4 if he plays a4. He weakens his queen side, he does our bidding for us so and if he doesn't, we can advance the pawn to a4 at least perhaps all the way to a3 get his knight back to a1 and induce more weaknesses, and we can even lift the rook up through a5 to b5. So we do a million things with this. One move well, g4 would also blunder. The knight or g3 would give the knight up, but even if it didn't, we have the e4 square. Okay. Now we need to be careful, we need to you. We need to put on our tactical hard hats we're on a construction zone. We have several ways to capture this knight with the knight in the bishop. I know most people are thinking you can't take with a knight, but let's give that a try. If we take with a knight- and then he takes queen- takes f4, I'm seeing that the queens have a standoff and at knight takes e5 queen f4. What move does black have there knight d3 check winning the queen? How do you see that? How do you even let your brain find that it's a mentality thing you've got to at least consider what happens? If I do it anyway, can I spend another 10 15 seconds on that key position he can take on d5, but a queen train is perfectly suitable to us we're up a piece and um. If he doesn't trade queens, then we've won another pawn. We have preserved our dark squared bishop yeah. Okay, he takes okay. Now we cannot take it after our bishops, hey, let's move the bishop. We can move it to f6. We can move to d6, it really doesn't matter, let's move it to f6 and keep it on the long diagonal and we still have the idea of going a4 a3. That's the point. I've been trying to make at several points today is even though queens can be traded. That doesn't mean you should forget about attacking um. Okay. Well, let's think about this. For a second, if we go a4, his knight can position itself on d4, that's sort of annoying. Can we prevent preemptively his knight from coming to d4 without without ruining the bishop's control over the long diagonal, yeah c5? How about this move and then once we play for the knight is to drop back in turn that will allow us to go a3 and shatter his entire queen side. So these prophylactic moves are really the oil that makes the machine run. We didn't have to play it we're up a piece, but I'm trying to illustrate the general concept right of preemptively stopping retreating squares when you can afford it. Sometimes you can't afford to do that. Okay, if he pushes b3, then he gives up the c3 pawn and, more importantly, his entire position is ruined. So now we're going to oh now we're going to take we're going to start looking for tactics. Okay, so let's gather the data here. Our bishop is hanging. Our bishop is hanging um so and our bishop actually doesn't have that many good squares, but that's okay. Why is that? Okay? Because we have a lot of tactical concepts in this position that we can that we can rely on now rook before check. A lot of people are seeing, but then he's got knight, b3 and amazingly, he sort of survives there, or so it seems, but actually, if we calculate a little bit further- and we give this check his knight is now pinned. The rook is not hanging because of the pin and there's no way for him to get to my bishop. So we can just play c4. This is essentially a trade, but it's a good trade because we preserve the attacking chances. He takes our bishop, we take his knight and then the c file gets open and we can use that c file to get to the c3 pawn. If that makes sense, I probably didn't find the best way to play. It doesn't matter we're completely winning. We can go rook c8, forcing his rook to a passive square and then we're going to be up a piece. We've simplified the position and the rest is a matter of just picking up the hanging pawns so to speak. Okay, yeah! This isn't the best, but I illustrated a nice concept I think, and we're still completely winning so, okay, rookie three is good. Now what we're gonna do we're gonna go g5 we're going to isolate this weak pawn on f5 we're gonna, just look around the board and turn the vacuum cleaner on. I call this turning the vacuum cleaner on we're just picking up his weak pawns. What are his weak pawns that we can get to? What are the pawns that we can like get to here? There are two that I'm thinking of the first is the f5 pawn which we just created. The second is the h fun and we can swing the rook around and win the h-bun. Remember that the ultimate idea in such end games is to create a past fun. So from that perspective, taking this pawn is good, because then we can start pushing the h-bot and I'm actually ignoring this deliberately and I'm even ignoring a check on h2, because this pawn is going to go so fast and you guys will see that he simply has doesn't have the firepower to stop. It watch watch how quickly this pawn just runs to infinity right exactly so now we're just going to get our rook back and then run this punt up the board. I don't care about anything else. All I'm going to look for is whether he threatens my rook. You got to be careful. You don't want to be too cavalier about these positions here, he's not going to be able to stop it. Whoa look who's here, gm hikaru! Thank you, five gifted from the man himself ikaru! Thank you. I really appreciate it. Uh wow, I think he's got a thing or two to learn from the speedrun. You know. After all, I don't think he's fully grasped some of these concepts. Uh you know and uh. Thank you. Thank you. Car really appreciate that. Thank you youtube! Congratulations that was well done and uh. I really appreciate that. Okay uh. So what is our goal in this position? Our goal is to get his king onto a square where we can, where we can check it with the rook. If we, if we were to move our rook right now anywhere, he would simply take on h2, so we need to use tactics to draw his king to a checkable square and that square would be c3, so we notice the square on c3 we capture twice and now, we've gotten the king onto a checkable square such that we can now promote to a queen check yeah. We can fossilize him here, check I'll, take the juicer, and now the mate is very simple. We just ladder check, made him on h3 right, good game and um yeah. I'm gonna slow this down, for the sake of you, know certain gm's who might not understand the pace: okay, um. Basically, this was a modern which we play and um we took on e4, which is the common tactic in these positions. I've talked about this before. When you see this and you see a knight on f6, you should connect the dots and play knight takes e4 to break into his center um and the best way of dealing with this. In my opinion, how can white deal with this to preserve his bishop and not give up a pawn like what is the sort of move that is often played in these positions? Well, the perk starts with d6. It's actually very often transposes into each other bishop d3, and now you take on e4, and now we can go after this pawn. We can go knight, d7 and c5 and attack the pawn. Thank you, justin hykus and black, basically liquidates white's center. Black is doing very much fine here. That is why knight e4 is good, but he decided to take on f7, okay and um. That's the reason we played h6 is to prevent his knight from accessing the g5 square. That would not have been that dangerous. So this is an example of where I, as a gm, might have played differently right. I might have just developed my knight or developed my bishop, but I want to illustrate this concept of playing prophylactically to you, guys right so d5, knight, g5, and what can happen here is that he gets his knight to e6 and he forces us to give up our light squad. Bishop and this leads to a host of unpleasant consequences. Uh does that make sense. So that's why we start with h6. We deprive the knight of the square, and only after he goes c3 do we go d5 and the knight has to go to an inferior square, then g5 so knight c6. Now we develop and he blunders his bishop here after this everything was very obvious. He probably should have done this first. This would have made bishop f4 possible, and can somebody remind me, what did we plan to do against this move or against many other moves? Thank you, spencer, lux, for let's hear one so not g5, because that would create too many weaknesses on the king side right, mr llama. It does you're right, but the reality is here. Well it also. It all hinges on us. Finding the next move, knight g5 comes with tempo. It attacks the rook. It makes us lose time that time allows him to increase his control over e6. So the move, ladies and gentlemen, is queen to d6. We are doing two things. First of all, we are, we are bringing the e5 square under control and, second of all, we are stopping bishop f4. Why are we stopping bishop before because we can take earning us two pieces for a rook, which is very good for black okay. The logic should be pretty simple here: um queen to d6, and also we're potentially preparing e5, which would liquidate us from the weakness. So at this level it all kind of depends on tempe and concreteness right. The concept can be correct, but the execution can be wrong. Thank you, spiro man, for the tier one, but he blunders the bishop. And now everything is very simple. We bring our pieces in, and now knight takes. C5 was like the key move. Thank you. Dragon x. If queen takes f4, then knight d3 check with a discovered track and winning the queen well jockeys. If you consider the material sort of, if you literally consider the math uh, usually bishops and knights are considered three points. Each and a rook is considered five points with six against five, but that doesn't tell the whole story in the middle game. Two pieces for a rook is usually good for the two pieces. In the end game there could be a confounding factor, a rook, and this is something people should remember. When you have no other pieces on the board. A rook is often very much superior to two pieces uh, because rooks are more mobile and they could go around vacuuming up pawns. It can be much harder for the bishop and the knight, for example, to coordinate in time to prevent the rook from you know, running amok and taking pawns and supporting passers. So if you have an endgame, you need to be careful if you have a middle game, two pieces usually better than a rook okay. So the really only interesting moment of this game, which I didn't fully explain, I think, is here so c5 right. We want to play a4 and the logic that you should be using right when you're, considering a move, can I play move x and you say well: where can my opponent move his piece knight d4 yeah? We can trade, but I'm trying to illustrate the concept here. Can we take that square away from him? First, yes, we can c5 and then we want to play a4. How can I determine whether a trade is good for me or not? Well, I mean look. I can't give you an algorithm. What I'm trying to do here is show you how I do these kinds of things in the game, but um, basically at the bottom line you you want to weigh whether your piece is better than your opponent's piece, and I think this bishop is on the long diagonal. It can support an attack and I don't really want to give it up. Unless I have to. I ended up giving up the other bishop and it is precisely the dark square bishop which ultimately won me the game. This bishop was responsible yeah. I think I'm going too fast for hikaru. He, I don't think he's he's following this: uh rook takes c3 the reason this works is because the bishop controls the c3 square. Does that make sense.
