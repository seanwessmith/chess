Now during the game, because it's a five minute game, I go relatively fast. You know I involve you. I ask people questions, but I go fast and not everything is going to be easy to follow. If you have questions, I try to answer each and every question. I want every single one of you to feel like you are learning and to understand every step of my thinking process. It's a very ambitious goal, but it's one that I try my best to adhere to [Music] and without further ado. Let us get started, it's a five minute game. Let's go you guys, ready to learn we're playing an 800, that's our highest rated opponent. So far, we're going to stick to the main openings we've been playing, which is e5 and e4. He goes for the scotch game now in the scotch. We have so far been playing the bishop out to c5 development with tempo very important he takes on c6 now queen f6 is charlie's move against xqc, but let's um. Let's just take the knight here- and I got my own notebook where I write down exactly what I will emphasize after the game. So what do we do? What do we do in this position? We need to keep developing in order to keep developing. We need to get this bishop out. So let's go d6. Let's go d6 to open up the diagonal. Why does the pawn structure not matter? I will explain later why, even though black's pawn structure may seem damaged, that's actually a good thing as well. How do we continue developing buck pull in? Thank you. How do we continue developing? Who and nothing to invent here- no need to reinvent the wheel? Let's just develop actively good job, malcolm tucker. Okay, now- and this is where we get to the art of violating rules strategically. Okay goes bishop g5. Now I don't like this bishop, let's get it out of here and okay. Well, that was a mistake. Bishop. He should have gone bishop f4. What did we take with? Obviously the queen, fantastic we've gotten rid of his bishop and we're threatening checkmate? Our queen is very nicely placed on an active square. All our pieces are playing depending on what he does if he castles or if he goes queen d2. I assume he's going to defend against mate. Well, there's one more thing that we need to do before. We even need to think about plans. What is that one thing? What is that one thing that we need to do we need to castle. Okay, let's take care of the fundamentals before we um before we think about anything. Now what oh well, okay, b3! We know from our previous speedrun experience that whenever our opponent pushes a pawn, we need to understand what has been left behind. What weakness has been left behind in this case, it's very easy to see that he has blundered a knight in trying to defend his b2 pawn preemptively retroactively. You guys might realize that I wanted to put my rook on ba to try to induce that movement. He's done that for us, let's recap really quickly: how we're going to win this game. There are two main methodologies toward winning and converting material advantage. One is to trade off all the pieces and to reach an endgame, and the other is to use that extra piece and attack. We can do a little bit of both. How can we do a little bit of both? We have a move that offers a trade, and if he goes for that trade we simultaneously enhance our attacking possibilities toward his king. When I say attacking possibilities, you should be thinking of this f2 pawn and you should be thinking of how to increase the pressure on that pawn. One is queen d4 perfectly good move, but I personally like the move. Bishop e6, because I keep the queen on this beautiful c3 square, where it's unassailable. He cannot play rookie three [Laughter], sorry that was an evil left. He did play rookie three, but just gives up the rook and he resigns there's a popcorn stuck in my mouth. Sorry, oh god. Well that was a quick one. Okay and um a couple things a lot of people take on d4. We have been over that and the reason that this is not a good move for black could does somebody remember so. I'm gonna play devil's advocate for a second I'm gonna play devil's advocate. Isn't it the case that you don't want to develop your queen in the opening, and so this would be good for black like? Why is this not good for black, even though the queen is out in the opening yeah, you lose the tempo, but the other thing that I want people to understand here is that you don't have a knight on b8 to attack the queen with. If you compare this to the scandi, if you compare this to the scandi here, white has the move, knight c3 with tempo, develop him with tempo. Here he cannot develop a tempo, and so the queen is actually nicely centralized. So we play bishop c5 and here, if you guys, remember the game famous game xqc against charlie, it was this position in which xqc would move moves, uh overturned the opposite move or played c3, so queen f6 is actually another move, but we took with a b pawn now. Why are we not taking with the d pawn and opening up the center? Well, the reason is simple: he takes our queen. We don't want to get our king out to d8 so early. We need a castle. I don't want an end game this early now daniel. Why are you excuse me guys? Sorry, guys, I've been talking a lot today, I'm gonna try to hydrate as much as possible. Now daniel, you might be saying. Why are you ruining your fun structure, as I've said before, pawn structure should not be the most important consideration unless that pawn structure is near the king, what do we gain in return for seemingly ruining our pawn structure? Okay, why? What are we gaining and there's two things? I'm looking for. First of all, trjn says open b file. Exactly later on, we could put our rook on the b file and what is the second thing? This might be a little bit less obvious november swimming that man deserves a sub because he just wanted out the other thing. Now this pawn break is going to be a lot easier to execute, because that b pawn that c pawn newly created is going to be able to support that pawn push. So you guys see how there's many sides to the same coin. Okay, we go d6 uh part of the reason that we did not go knight f6 immediately. This would be a little bit inaccurate because it would give white an extra opportunity in the scotch, particularly you always have to be careful about allowing this move. There's e5. This is not the end of the worlds, but why allow that when we can simply first play d6? Okay, knight, f6 bishop g5 h6, he takes on f6, which is a typical mistake. At this level you see a capture you make the capture, you gotta critically evaluate every trade that you make the move. Bishop h4 would be a lot more effective because it keeps the pin jason 77 asks why d6 and 95 well remember to count defenders and attackers. There's one two: three attackers, one two defenders, there's more attackers than defenders, so this would blunder a pun, sad thing. I would have otherwise loved to play this move. Okay, so bishop h4 would have kept the pin now. I want you guys to answer me or attempt to answer the following question. Would we play the move g5 here? Is there a case to be made for playing this move? If so, what is the case? If not, why not bc says do not push the pawn? No most people are saying. No, why am and I haven't, am I not getting rid of the pin? Isn't that a good thing? It weakens your king's side bingo. It weakens the king's side too much no problem. He might without castle queen side big deal big whoop, I'm gonna castle, queenside. Well, guess what we did ruin our pawn structure a little bit so castling queen side would be unthinkable here with so many open squares. So you got to be very careful about making a move such as g5. Sometimes you want to play it, but in this position I would delay that move. I would probably even consider castling and yes, this pin is unpleasant. That is true, but you can get rid of the pin by moving the queen out of the way you don't have to go g5 and once your pieces are more in the game, then you could actually still consider going g5 in some circumstances, but that's a move. You got to be very, very careful about okay, so that's basically it I mean he took an f6 and very quickly blundered if he played a move such as queen d2. I was considering going rook b8. This would be emphasizing the benefit of um. You know of opening the b file if he goes b3 once again. This would be a blunder. It doesn't blunder the knight directly. But what does this now allow bike record? Thank you for the sub appreciated. Bishop b4 is correct, and now the knight is lost, so how should white actually defend? If you were playing white here, let's flip the board, how would you actually want to defend the pawn? This is very important. How do you defend the pawn without making an incredibly passive move, such as rook b1, but but guys problem with rook v1? Is that the rook is now completely sort of enslav? I mean it's, it's just it's not doing anything other than defending the pawn. You got to be very, very careful about a heavy piece that could be doing a lot of heavy lifting doing something as trivial as just defending a pawn. So the move, bishop b3 very nice guys- would be much better because now you are organically defending the pawn and the bishop is multitasking, unlike in life. Sometimes it's good for pieces to multitask. The bishop is simultaneously pressuring this diagonal and it's throwing its body against the rook and it's very nicely supported by pawns. Thank you slipped, the jab for 500, I you're all good man. I appreciate the support. Thank you so much for that kind message. That's exactly right and once he played b3, a lot of people were suggesting queen d4. Here, that's a fine move, totally fine move, but I would argue that after queenie2 that queen on d4 becomes very susceptible to the move, rook d1, while the queen on c3, if you think about it, is not susceptible to rookie 3, which he played anyway. What is the purpose of the move? Bishop e6? What do we gain from this trade? Well, we gave it the trade of minor pieces, which is good, and we also gain huge pressure on the f2 square, which we could then transmute into some sort of a tactic. So here actually already- and this is a bit advanced- black- has a tactic that allows him not only to win the spawn but to enhance the attack. It's a two move sequence. Could somebody find it and I'll get to what? If white, doesn't trade in a moment is correct? Rook takes after rook f2r cafe and well guess what white doesn't have any pieces to defend the stroke with? Obviously, if he defends the queen, that does not help. I mean you're defending the stroke and you're attacking this one. So if he actually takes you don't need to take the queen. This is just check me um. Somebody was asking a very pertinent question. What if the bishop moves away? What have we gained by well? What have we gained? We've developed our bishop. Now we can bring a rook into the game and later or even immediately, we can still open up the f file by playing f5. Okay, so just wanted to be clear that these are the two methods of of converting a material advantage and we can do both okay. So last thing: before we move on to the next game, some somebody asked um knight to d1. You are making the same mistake. The knight is now only defending the pawn and doing nothing else. It's actually sowing disunity among white's ranks, no pun intended, because it's disconnecting the rooks- and you really don't want to do that. It's also relinquishing the defense of the e4 pawn which black can pick up on by playing rook e8, okay, um. So last thing somebody asked: what does compensation mean? What the hell does? This word mean compensation. You hear a throat, okay, sacrifice all night: okay, compensation, okay, but okay, I sacrificed his opponent. I had compensation, what does compensation mean now, obviously in life, to compensate someone for a service rendered means to you know, somebody renders a service and you get compensated, let's say with money, and the kernel of that is contained in a chess sense as well. Compensation is when you sacrifice material, let's say sack of pawn and you get something in return for the pawn and that something is very broad. It could be a million different things. It could be an attack, but but it doesn't have to be an attack. It could be something as simple as an outpost. It could be something as simple as an open file. It could be something as simple as a single piece or a desirable trade uh. You have to think of compensation in a very broad sense to understand its full meaning and the more obscure the compensation, the more positional the compensation, the harder it is to decide upon, to decide upon a particular sacrifice. Now let me give you guys a very quick example of what I don't want to spend too long on this. But let's talk about what compensation may look like one. Second, please: let's talk about what or it could be a square. I will show you guys a very famous example of sacrificing something for compensation: okay, um. Let me think about the game: um, okay, one! Second, please! I will show you guys a game between uh from the famous tigran petrossian, who was, of course a former world champion known for his positional mastery, and he had a very famous game in 1953 this. Some of you will be familiar with this particular moment, but I think it's a great illustration of the notion of compensation and what it exactly entails. Uh before we move on to the next game, um all right. So I and again these concepts like outposts all this stuff. I will define it properly as we go along. I'm gonna try to weave it into uh our natural discussion, if that, if that I don't know if that makes sense, but uh that's what I'm going to try to do now. One second guys, I'm not sure why this isn't working there we go so the position in front of you was uh played between samuel roshefsky, one of the strongest american players of the 20th century and tigran petrossian was black zurich 1953 black is worse. Okay, because look at white's beautiful, pawn center d4 e5. You know if black allows d5, I'm not going to take too long evaluating this, but in this position, petrosian played an exchange sacrifice in order to to stop the motion of white's central pawns, petrossian plays rookie six. He sacrifices the exchange, which means rook for bishop or knight. Rushevsky doesn't take it immediately, but let's imagine that roshewski would have taken the knight. What is it that black gets in return for this exchange as aladdin 64 is pointing out black gets an amazing square for his knight. What is this square, and how does black get this knight to that square? He gets a center pawn in which contests white central pawn motion. That is true, but look at this amazing juicy square for the night and look at what happens when black brings this knight here, it's actually the best move. Actually it is the best move according to the computer, this knight is unassailable. They call it an eternal night in russian. It stops the center. It's amazing in its control, its domination over the board is white still a little bit better. Yes, white is still a little bit better, but this is the essence of positional compensation. You get something very weighty in return for an exchange or a piece, it's not actually mysterious. This is what's known as a positional sacrifice. When people hear this word- oh my god, oh positional sacrifice. I don't. I don't want to even talk about it, but that is what a positional sacrifice really is. All it really is is a sacrifice in return for something positional such as a good square. Okay, um, that's what it is. How do you come up with this move? Well, petrosian realized that if he allows a move such as e6, then he's going to be run out of the gym, and so he tells himself. I have to stop this at all costs and it's worth sacrificing something to stop this idea. There are far more mind-blowing positional sacrifices, which I will get to later. I will write this down positional sex, but for now I just wanted to define that. I hope that makes it a little bit clear. I'm sorry! I went so quickly through this position. Coin eternal russian and russian eternal knight in russian is virtually coined, of course, my pleasure. Let's continue guys everybody ready for a second speed run game, I'm again backwards, pawn outpost, you guys can google that, but I will eventually define all these concepts in the course of our games, but I want to keep things moving dynamically. So, let's get let's continue, okay, so we're going to go e4 we're playing net camps already up to the 800s and that already stumps them. Apparently, let's see what he does. Okay, he might not make a move. Now again, all ratings are refunded. I will abort in 15, okay, he goes d6, so he goes for. What's called the perk opening, he allows white to gain control of the center. This is not a bad opening if black plays well, but at the level of my opponent, most people who play this move are not fully aware of how to play this and they get in trouble very quickly. I'm gonna try to show you okay, so this is of the category of openings that people play to try to intimidate you to throw you out of your comfort zone. You guys remember that when we see an opening like this, we need to abide very strictly by opening principles. If we do that, we're not going to get in a lot of trouble, there's a couple of ways to play this. We can control the center even more with our pawns or we can begin developing our pieces either. Strategy is good. Normally in such situations, we have prioritized development, but since we're rated a little bit higher, let me show you how I would actually play so I would actually play the move. C4 expanding our central control, but because our center is so vast, okay- and this is where people run into a lot of trouble. So listen carefully. People get too fixated on on expanding the center and forget that they need to support it with their pieces. So I would not play f4, which would not be a bad move, but that would overexpand my center it's more important to start developing than to keep expanding and expanding and expanding. So let's get our night out and start enhancing our control over the center he's developing terribly I mean you guys can see he's just playing so passively and f4 is good here, but again I would probably play f4, but let's practice sound positional principles. So let's continue developing okay. He his clock wasn't running for some reason: he's played bishop e7 and I really lagged whoa. Okay, so something froze there. Okay, let's continue! Sorry, I don't know what was going on anyways, I lost a bunch of time. There was some server lag. Bishop d3 we're gonna, keep developing now notice. What I want you guys to notice. What I want you guys to notice is that is that he's developing very powerfully we're continuing to develop where people really struggle is in transforming in transforming their space advantage into something more tangible. So if you are among those people, I want you to look carefully and we have not a lot of time here on the clock, so I'm going to play a little bit faster, but I want to look carefully at how I actually do that everything is nicely developed other than this bishop. But what do we do with that? How do we actually make stuff happen out of that? Well, normally, when I say make stuff happen, what I really mean is we need to expand in the center and we need to start attacking on one of the flanks which of the flanks. Do you think we're going to start attacking on? Why did we put this bishop on d3? Why do we put this bishop on d3? How might we open that bishop up and what kind of stuff are we going to be looking for when we do that, bingo we're going to be looking to play e5 and when we play e5? Those of you familiar with the greek gift sacrifice, there's one thing to bear in mind which is incredibly important, which is that when you are doing the greek gift sacrifice and after the game before I leave I'm going to talk about, let me take first just to avoid the central tension and then I'll play e5. The greek gift sacrifice starts with bishop takes h7, followed by knight g5. Here, black has a bishop on e7 guys. So one of the preconditions for the greek gift is that the g5 square has to be uncovered by your opponent. Here it is covered, so we can't do the great gift, but we can do something else, and what I want you guys to understand is that, even though you might be thinking of attacking, you should always be looking for more simple ways to win such as just winning your opponent's material. So here mike, is seeing the move. I look at this night. I see whoa whoa whoa whoa. Where is this knight it's on the rim? Does this knight have any escape squares? No, it doesn't knight f6 ef knight, f4 bishop f4, so we can just trap the knife by playing g4, I'm violating a rule here daniel. Aren't you pushing a pawn in front of your king. You just said this was bad. This is an exception to the rule, because I'm winning a darn knight if he had more pieces on the king side. Okay, maybe I would have done this with a lot of reservations, but he doesn't have anything on the king's side. This is the consequences of him developing his pieces terribly. The consequences of that is that he is not able to exploit the fact that I pushed upon in front of my king. He has to give up his knight, let's continue attacking. How do we continue well in order to attack this pawn? We need to bring some pieces into the game. In particular, I'm looking at this knight on c3. Where can we put this knight yeah g5 is good. G5 is good. Let's go g5. Let's actually push the bishop away and if he takes on c3 that plays into our hands that actually is a trade which is good for us and we get rid of one of the defenders surrounding his king, which is also good. Okay. Well, let's take the bishop, thank you for giving it to us and now very important not to play queen h5. That would be a very tempting move and it would be a very bad one because he plays g6. So let's get 94 in just centralizing the knight now we're going to get the queen to h5 and we are going to accumulate the pieces around our opponent's kit um. He actually probably should take on e4 and go g6, but you know he's on his last legs here. Uh and the question is: is he going to defend as tenaciously as possible or um well, or is he going to succumb quickly? What are we threatening in this position? I have a feeling that he might miss this. I have a feeling that he might play moves to just e5. If I know these players, what are we threatening very good guys, knight f6? How do you find a move like this? It's simple, you see h7. You know that you're trying to attack that square. What's stopping this from being checkmate? Obviously it's the fact that we have a knight here, obstructing the bishop, so knight f6. Now I see that it's not entirely made. He can still take with the knight. If he takes with a knight he defends h7, we take the knight he's got to go g6 and what kind of mate am I already thinking about? What kind of mate am I already thinking about after he goes g6? I want the name of this mate bingo. Lobster instrument can I make. Can I made him immediately with queen h6? Don't rush, guys very important to be disciplined? Can I play queen h6? No, you cannot because of queen takes f6, that's okay. I saw that. So what we're going to do is we're going to drop the queen back then we're going to bring the bishop out and now we're threatening the lobster pincermate. He has to go h5 in order to defend he doesn't so, let's lobster rip into him, you see how clear, when you're up a piece and you're attacking like this you're, not always in a hurry. Thank you, flyerton good, to see you my friend, good, to see you my friend, and this will be the last game of the stream guys and I will return around 1am or so for another hour to continue the speed run. Bishop takes f6 and we can actually pre-move queen g7, because because there is just no defense now very quickly what if he had played h5 in order to block the queen's at brock block the queen's access to h6. Well, here's how I think of this position. Do you guys see the relationship between the bishop and the queen? Okay, this relationship is a very important one. I have told you guys about it before when there is a relationship like this called an x-ray, a piece staring at the queen, in particular through the lens of another piece you immediately and everybody's. Seeing this so quickly. That's incredible! You immediately need to start thinking. Okay, if I play f7, that's going to be a check, I'm going to win a queen, and so you can play bishop takes g6 sacrificing one. Bishop f takes g6 f7 and you win the queen, but daniel you didn't give lobster pinch remain. I thought you wanted to give lobster pincer mate. Well, that's where the notion of flexibility comes in okay, you have to be flexible as to the objective of your attack, winning a queen. I think nobody would disagree with me is a pretty good result of an attack. So that's why it's so important to be open-minded to what it is you're trying to accomplish. Okay, so that's what I would do if he doesn't take the bishop, then the road is clear you can play queen takes h5 or bishop h5. The king is wide open and at your leisure you could basically give the lobster pins or mate all right shinigami. Thank you so much for the seven months, amazing stuff going on and that's basically what I did now. Let's quickly go over the game, I do have to run uh, but let's quickly go over the game. I thought I had a little bit more time, but that's okay. I might be back guys um. I think that everything I did in the opening should make sense to you guys. I played bishop d3 because I'm anticipating him castling and I want to play e5 and open up the bishop's control of the h7 square. Thank you, hortback. So much appreciate it um and here I played e5, and what would I have done had he played 98, which is a better move? How do we actually proceed? Uh with the attack now? One thing that I want to make very clear is that when we have a pawn on h7 like this, when we try to greek gift, as I said, we can't do this because g5 is under black's control. That is the litmus test for determining when a greek gift sacrifice works. Sometimes it works even when there is a piece defending the square. That is a complicated scenario which I will go to go through later, but I want to talk about the notion of a battery. Batteries are when two pieces are stacked, either on top of each other or on the same diagonal. Usually the most effective batteries are going to be doubled, rooks, which is a type of battery or the most famous battery a queen and a bishop on the same diagonal. Do we want it to be like this? No, we don't, because when we have a queen bishop batter, we normally want to lead with the queen. Why do we want to lead with the queen because white threatens checkmate? And if we juxtapose that with this position, this is a serious threat, but it's not a threat of checkmate. There are exceptions to the rules. Sometimes the situation is chaotic, so you want your queen behind a wall of defenders. Here his pieces are so passive that we can set up the battery with total impunity. Now wait a second. We set up the battery big whoop, he just defends, but the point of the battery isn't to deliver checkmate right. We think he's going to defend against checkmate, but when he plays g6 he introduces more weaknesses on the king side. This is how you attack, which we can then exploit by putting our pieces on better squares. Now we can do a bunch of different things. We can get the knight over to f6 and again this position smells of a lobster. Pins are made. So what I want to make very clear is that attacking is not about finding one idea and then getting super disappointed when this idea doesn't work. It's about orchestrating ideas and when these ideas don't work in the sense of delivering mate, we think okay. Well, how is this idea weakened his position? How do we develop new ideas that stack on top of what it is that we were trying to do in the first place? Riemann asks a great question: what about bishop c6 to stop queen e4? Well, there's a couple of things we could do here. We could go rook d1 to create the pin against the screen. We could attack on multiple angles and guess what if he plays queen b6, we can already think about playing knight g5, because we ask ourselves what is the drawback of his queen move. Well gets the screen away from its control of g5, so we can play knight g5 to open up the queen's access to h5. This is all part of the art of attacking chess attacking is incredibly difficult. That is a skill we master over the course of many years um and um. Obviously, even I have not mastered attacking uh, it's it's it's something that involves so many complex elements that um that there's so many components moving parts. What are other ways, besides a great gift, to translate central control into a tangible advantage? Well, jeff, I'm talking about them here, you're, not seeing greek gift sacrifice what you're seeing is a sustained effort to attack the spawn without a greek gift. There's also concepts of transforming a central advantage into an attack on the other flank. You don't have to always attack the king, but that is the fundamental transformation I mean I'll talk, also about queen side, attacks and last question. So what if, in this position? What if he just goes h6? Well guess what h6 weakens his king and how do we exploit this weakness? I'm already thinking of sacrificing that bishop on h6 later on, this is called a hook. I'll talk about hooks later and I'll talk about other attacking elements. The time being guys, I do have to take off.
