No, no, not I'm not a rap. That's an inside joke 1927.! Let's go back to the accelerated dragon and he plays the smith mora. Now, I'm not going to take the pawn, and this plays back into the psychology of gambit players when you resist their kind of territory uh they get frustrated. So what can black do here, uh by way of refusing the smith moore? What is the best way to refuse it droopy miller? Thank you for three months. We can transpose them to the aleppo and sicilian we can transpose into the aleppo and sicilian by playing knight, f6 I'll, explain this in greater depth after the game. So we've trans literally transposed into the elephant, which is also annoying uh, which I've played queen takes d4, is the way that most smith, moral players actually go here so uh this, I actually know very well um. Well, I know not very well. I know it decently, so you go e6 to defend the knight uh queen takes d4 is a very dangerous line if black doesn't know what to do uh. Of course, I would refer you to mark esterman's, amazing book mayhem in the mora and, I don't say amazing, about a lot of books. So it's a labor of love, uh mark is the ultimate specialist in the mora. You should listen to him rather than me, but as far as I know, uh the move here is f5. We chase the queen away and now this is the key. Let me remember so let me actually try to remember my analysis. Yes, so here's the thing white wants to play. C4 we go b5 here we sacrifice the pawn in order to get queen side counter play. This is still theory and um. He doesn't take the pawn and now I think we go either a5 or we can develop the bishop first. So let's go a5 continuing to expand and then bishop a6, basically creating that potential skewer against the queen knight to a4. Now this one, I already don't know, maybe I'm still caught in theory. Let me think about this, so he wants queen h5. He wants queen h5 and uh. That's got kind of concerning and he also wants to take on. D5 can we defend against both threats at the same time? Well, we can drop the knight back to e7, not glamorous, but I guess I messed up here. I don't know uh this guy. This guy out prepared me so um we'll see, but that's not the end of the world. Now we can get our queen to c7 in order to pressure the pawn on e5. All right, relax focus grassy we will. We will see plenty of 1900s know this much theory uh, particularly if um, okay, so rookie one now uh there's a couple of problems here that we need to solve here. Uh. The first is the problem with this bishop right. This bishop is not about, but if we go g6 we create holes in our position, um that that he can potentially occupy. But again it's all about the priorities. Our top priority here is to complete our development. Come on, may buy hooker by crook, we're gonna, fianchetto the bishop and then we're gonna try to castle so that I don't get checkmated in the center of the board, miss skewer on b4 nope. I actually saw that um. I did see the move before and he has c4 in response to that. So I did actually spot that move, but I don't believe it was that good okay, so he goes b4. That is a very odd move. I I mean I'm not gonna really react to it. I'm just gonna complete my development, okay, so bishop to b2 um. Now, let's unpack this for a second, I'm not sure why I can't just take on e5 uh, but I'm actually gonna trust him and I'm gonna castle. Here, I'm a little bit concerned that this is still like semi-preparation. So I'm just gonna complete my development. I think he had some ideas like c4, okay, but now I'm not going to trust him any longer. What should black do? Here I mean and let's keep it simple. I think that we can now just do what yeah we can just take the pawn you just take and take, and I actually um- I actually don't see what he has in return for this okay and uh we're up upon. We still have this very nice outpost for the knight. Now this bishop on a6 is sort of dull right, but it's got a lot of potential energy, especially if we play the move, b4 so uh. What should we do here? How do we prepare the move? B4? Well, there's a couple things to notice here: he's attacking the pawn on d5 on b5 he's sort of semi-attacking, because if he takes it, he walks himself into a very nasty little pin uh, but actually I think he can get away with this and I'll explain this after the game so huh. This is a complicated situation. What I'm gonna do let me think about this: I'm going to go queen to a5. The idea is simple. I just want to defend the pawn first and then I want to go knight b to d5. I think that this queen is actually going to be very well placed here. It's going to put pressure on the pawn which is going to discourage him from bringing his rook into the game. Yeah I could have moved the other night, but then this knight would have gotten uncomfortable. Okay, now we're going to go knight b to d5 according to planet. H4 is a good move. Uh he's he's, starting to pressure and massage my king side, which is kind of weak. So it's time for me to act. Okay, so take stakes, and now we're gonna go before opening up the bishop. It's a battle on both flanks queen to d2, though very strong move here, um and uh. My king side is in some trouble here, so I'm gonna have to be very careful about it. Okay, he does it. So let's just take this pawn, let's just get rid of it uh and it does ruin my king side a little bit. That is true, but here's the thing uh, he doesn't have any pieces on the king side. Yet so it's not like checkmate is imminent uh. He can put his queen on g5, but yup he does uh and but but but I can bring my defenders in as well, and I want to emphasize that you shouldn't be afraid of moves like these, just because they look intimidating, because now I've brought my own queen into the game. My queen's gonna have something to say about the threat of knight g5 okay, so he should definitely not trade queens he's playing very well, but I think we'll be able to survive this okay yeah his pawn on e5 is really working in my favor. We again have the same situation three pieces biting on the same pawn, which is very much to my favor okay. What should we do here to complete the defensive operation? What should we do to complete the defensive operation? We have. We aren't done on the king's side. We need to get the queen to g6. We need to get the queen to g6, so that knight, g5 is is, is no longer dangerous because it will not attack h7, okay, so rook c1, I'm going to respond to with rook to c8, I'm not going to. Let him run circles over me. Get control of the c file, also c3 square, something we should keep in mind uh for the future potential outpost. Okay- and this guy is just good but uh he's legit. So a couple of options here he wants to take on d5 and ruin our structure that it would not be acceptable thing to allow. So what should we do? What are the options here? We could consider f4. That's actually a super interesting move uh, but but I don't really want to allow bishop takes d5, so bishop b7 allows his knight to get around to d6, so let's actually go knight to c3. Let's use that outpost that we created on the previous move and f4 by the way ripping open the king yeah. He made a very strong move here, which I sort of semi underestimated. Um. Let me think for a second thank you godless for the tier one, hmm yeah, that's a very nasty move, very very nasty move and 92 is possible, but then my knight gets passive. Let's tickle him! Actually, let's go bishop h6 uh. Let's bring the bishop into the game and tickle his rook. I think bishop h6 is actually a very strong move uh and it's a very important move, because otherwise my knight was getting undermined, very complex game and I love this I'll. Be able to talk through a lot of concepts after the game, but in the interest of time I have to make some moves fast. Okay, now we can bring the other bishop. Where is the rook going? This is the power of having active pieces as goblins with a five gifted keeps the hype going amazing, his rook's not going anywhere all of our pieces guarding the rook's potential escape squares. Okay, so he takes on c3. Now we don't want to rush to take the rook. We can just play b. Take c3 and uh he's stuck between a rock and a hard place, because if he moves the rook, then he allows our pawn to push forward and he's gonna have to give up a piece for it, which is exactly what's gonna happen. He has to give up the knight for it, and now we are officially winning. We are up a full piece and we still have the potential to rip up in the king's side. Guys uh, please keep the unfounded accusations on the basis of two moves to a minimum um. That's not what we're about here. Uh trust me. If somebody actually is cheating, I usually have a good sense of it and I will make that known but uh I in you know put yourself in the shoes and I don't mean to lecture anybody here. Uh we've all gotten paranoid, but put yourself in this guy's shoes. If you're playing a good game, would you like uh, you know? Would you like for an entire community to turn against to turn against you, because you happen to know the theory so just common sense, justice will be served, okay, uh! So let's lift the rook up to h5 uh. You know so. Okay, now we're gonna lift the rook up, and this is just gonna be checkmate to the queen and the game is over okay, so that's winning um. Now all right that was a nice move, um, so uh smith, moore now, d-tank c3 is the accepted smith mora again, I would defer to mark's analysis here in his book: um knight, f6, so the accuracy. I know people are curious uh, so the accuracy was probably not too high. From my end, let's see it's analyzing it just one second jayrud! Thank you! So much appreciate it. Okay, so his accuracy was, it was 61 okay, so he made a lot of mistakes 88.7 for me uh. He played a very nice game. Let's not take anything away from him uh, but you know if you make up your mind after three moves, then uh you're not giving the guy a chance. Thank you. Thank you. Tcrh for the 300 appreciate the message, so I think that my mistake was the move. Bishop a6, I think I forgot to play bishop e7 and the purpose behind bishop e7 is to stop the knight from getting to h4, uh and and that's the key move that I missed. Then you play bishop basics. I confuse the move, order and very nicely done by him, knight h4 uh, opening up the possibility for quinn h5, so I had to drop my knight back. I had to double it back for completed here. He started going wrong with b4 um thanks shark appreciate it um. Here he started going wrong with before. I think he should have gone here and maybe you know chiseled his way into my position here with bishop f6, um and uh, that's sort of how I think he should have nurtured the initiative uh. Well, you know I've gotten accused myself and I understand uh that you know. Definitely. People have accused me of cheating and uh fresh freeze, and I understand it's a human instinct to get frustrated when somebody's playing well, cheating is a huge problem, I'm the first person to say that uh, but we have to be equitable as much as possible because we don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water there uh crow kaka. Thank you for the prime and fresh trees as well. Okay, um so and I uh I've shared a funny story before about getting accused. I was playing an unnamed grandmaster on icc. This was years ago and I had a secret account on icc. So I played a cheater and I think I drew him because it flagged him but uh then I noticed that that grandmaster was also playing uh, the cheater and I messaged him. I was like you're playing a clear cheater. Oh no, I said this guy is a cheater and he said just like you, I was like dang girl, I'm making his opinions. No, so I get it, but let's move on so anyways. We cancel, we complete. Our development went upon now. Here's the thing knight b to d5 is what people uh is is what uh people were sort of wanting me to do, but he takes on b5 and here's the key thing. It seems like we're winning the knight on b5, but we're not. How can he defend that knight? How can he defend that knight yeah? This is an authorized. Speed run account jesse rogers, so every people are aware. A4 is the move. Exactly pawns are very good defenders. It's an anchor so remember the key principle. When you can do something with a pawn, you usually should versus doing it with a piece okay, so before opening up the diagonal taking the pawn and then getting the queen into the defense. Okay, these are the moves that won me. The game, queen d, a queen e8. These are the moves that a lot of people uh would be unwilling to play. I think, because they're retreating moves, it looks like we've done something wrong uh, but the priority here is to get is to beef up our king side, security uh contesting the c file now knight c3 was a little hasty but bishop h6. Here. How did I see this move? Well, I basically I tried to think logically about what's making his position tick. What's making his position. Tick are three things right: the pawn which is undermining my pawn, the bishop and the rook. That's like a mechanism right. You can think of that in a vacuum. Can we try to disrupt that mechanism? In some way? Can we attack the bishop? I consider this move. This would have been a very reasonable move, but I was worried about putting my knight on the rim. Can we win the pawn? I mean no, because if we take the pawn, we dropped the knight, but the rook is a weak lick link- and I mentioned this before. Usually the strongest piece is the easiest piece to attack because it has to respond to most attacks and that's why I settled on bishop h6. He could have shut me down with f4, but that would have created a weakness on g3. Then we can go knight a4 and he his queen is kind of tied down to the pawn okay, so um yeah. I know some people were thinking that and this is just winning yeah. If four was possible, um, what's up logic, yeah yeah, I know I know I've been yeah um. Well, I'm excited to hear what um what what what this is that you mentioned, but uh anyways we've got. We've got as if all of the hype wasn't enough. We got the man himself in the chat as well um the absolute freaking man in the chat himself, okay, so um, but basically yeah. This is just winning for black, because the rook is um. The rook is just completely trapped. What would you say? The main takeaway is well, first of all, um. Theoretically speaking, uh, I'm not immune to screwing up in the opening. Okay, I'm not immune bloodline. I thank you for the tier one, I'm not immune uh to confusing stuff, okay and- and I did that here so don't think that, just because you know I'm a gm or something I know everything about the opening. I do stupid stuff all the time, but I didn't panic and I prioritized the right things which is completing the development. Then I took the pawn and and the main thing that won me, the game was recognizing when you need to make these unglamorous moves. Okay, these unglamorous moves are: what are the glue moves, that win you, the game right and and if you can know when to make them uh you stop your opponent's threats and uh you. You know you you end up in much better shape. Let me see, doesn't bishop g, someone stated uh how to recognize? Well, if it was that simple uh, everybody would be a gm, but I'm trying my best to uh. You know to flesh out the thought process. Why didn't you take the rook when it was trapped? Well, uh, because, basically I again there's no rush. If we take the rook, then he plays bishop takes b4 and at least he curbs his losses here. Not only is he going to lose his rope, but if he moves it he loses more stuff than that. So this is just uh, I'm just going for more here than just the exchange, but here we go no time wasted another game. Let's hope thank you, jay grindel, for the five gifted okay. So he plays the karo khan defense, which is we've encountered it a couple of times black prepares to go d5. Now we know that we want to control the center here and he goes d6. He doesn't go d5, okay, so basically uh. What am I going to do now? I'm simply going to develop my pieces, which is um, which is what you basically do in the opening. My opponent is just pushing his pawns out, which is weird uh, it's weird, but I don't have to change my strategy because my opponent's doing something weird. What should I do in this position? How should we continue developing and what's sort of the best, the simplest way of developing our pieces? We're going to keep it simple here: keep it old school who can tell me the simplest possible move. We could play sorry, we could play off four to control the center, but what I'm going to do is simply go knight. F3, no knights, before bishops is the key role. Now I'm going to develop my bishop now, I'm going to castle in the meantime he's just trolling me he's pushing all his pawns out. He thinks he's being intimidating or funny, neither of which are true. Okay, maybe he's being funny now here's the thing he finally developed a piece. Thank you, mr x, when your opponent plays this passively, you guys already know kind of the general thing that we have to do, which is to open up the center, because by opening up the center we're going to allow my pieces uh to just to actually infiltrate otherwise he's going to get away with this. So we need a plan. Now the obvious way of opening the center is to go e5, but then he's gonna go d5 and keep things shut. So what should I do? How should I smash the center open and keep it open? Should I go e5? No, I shouldn't what should I do? Let's get that hammer in and let's go d5 and I'm going to play a little bit faster. We had another plan that would have been even better and I'll. Explain it after the game, but here this is simple. Now he's trying to close the center look at this pawn on e5 very carefully. What I want to do here is: I want to push my pawn out to f4 in order to contest that pawn in order to open up that e file, which is the main artery to his king. But I can't do that right because there's a knight in the way. Where should we put the knight? Let's go knight d2, I didn't choose this square at random. This knight could then travel to c4 and attack the b6 pawn okay. He stops me from going f4 now. Knight c4 immediately would be fine, but then he would push his pawn out to b5 and attack my knight um. What should I do to preemptively? Stop him from pushing this pawn kind of like a surgeon. You know you're you're handcuffing, that pawn we should go a4. We use our pawn to prevent hispan from moving on the next move. We're going to sandwich this knight on c4 and we've got a very nice position here. We haven't really fully opened up the center, but his position is really full of holes. One of those holes is f5. We're going to stick a bishop. There just keep on increasing the pressure and guess what well we've got this e-file right. We want to open up the file, but we can't do that. Yet we got to prepare it. Let's prepare it by going rookie one and we're actually kind of ready to play f4 but okay, so he shuts down that e file um. Let's continue sort of chiseling our way uh into his position. How do we do that? We can deploy our queen, but I want to go a5 to create this little outpost for my knight on b6. Oh, that's, not a good move by him. What should we take with the knight or the rook? What do you guys think and again those of you who are sort of like not fully falling? I will explain everything after the game in far more depth. You can see this is a five minute game, so I have to play fast some things. I cannot explain at one of the time too. We take with the knight. Why? Because we attack the bishop, we want to play actively. We want to recapture in a way that creates a threat. Also, this knight has access to an outpost. Now we're going to lift our rook up potentially aiming for c4, where it's going to chase the queen away. Remember rooks can be activated too, but we can't go rook c4 immediately right. Why not because we dropped the knight, so can one of you brave souls tell me how can we first defend the knight so that we can then deploy our rook to c4? Yes, sir nose knows all does know the move it's queen a1. What am I doing? Well that queen's going to guard the knight, oh and he's going to regret this? He is going to regret this because we're going to take it now we're going to complete our plan. Now, we've given up a pawn, but I've sacrificed it. I haven't blundered it and the reason I sacrificed it is to open up that center. Remember that that was our initial plan and our opponent has basically done that for us, that's what a sacrifice is in chess. It's when you give something up for some reason right you give up upon in order to do something, that's good for you, okay, now we're going to well. What should we do? We've got a million moves here. Let me think for a second. I also have to I think, let's go knight c6. Let's stick our knight on this outpost queen to b7. Now, let's just keep increasing the pressure. How should we do that? Can somebody propose a move? How should we keep increasing the pressure? Let's go queen to a4, absolutely creating a pin. Now we can take with the rook very good guys. All of you are sharp. I appreciate it. The engagement okay. So now, let's lift the other rook up to b3. Let's go and where is mr queen going here now? The thing is: if the queen moves out to c7. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you 107 bits it. It walks right into the x-ray of the other rook. This is what happens when you have well-placed pieces um, mrs queen, I just sorry that was bad, mrs queen, of course um, but basically yeah he's on the ropes now. If, if knight b6 follows here, um, then well, then we have several things that we can do now notice that the queen is undefended here. So if I move the queen, let's say to here, then he will not be able to take the rook uh because uh, because the queen will be undefended, but actually this is not so simple. He does have a move. Uh d5, which I didn't fully anticipate uh, but, okay, so he's this guy is playing very well. So let me take. Let me think for a second here. We're still in good shape. Don't worry! Okay, so he does this wow. That is a very strong move yeah. This is actually kind of sticky. I have to say: okay, we can take the rook though, and now we can slide this rook over to g3. Now I've got a focus. I've got 20 seconds. This might be the strongest opponent we face today. So I couldn't have taken the knight and I'll explain why, after the game, it was an insane tactical idea that he came up with okay, now we're going to undermine this pawn and create some create some look for our king again I'll, explain everything after the game, but you guys can see. I have 23 seconds so I gotta play fast. The suspense is on the charlie fans, came at a great time. Okay, we're gonna, take the pun. He gives us a check, we're gonna move the king now I do happen to like bullet chests. So this is you know, I'm experienced in these types of situations and I gotta make a move. My man, my goodness, okay yeah, this guy is vastly underrated vastly underrated, but I think we'll be fine. All right, drum roll, please, ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please nobody go anywhere, I'm actually nervous, I'm winning, but I've got 13 seconds. Will I make it? Will I make it 11 seconds to win the end game? Will I do it all right where you got an endgame, I'm up a piece, but I gotta win this in nine seconds. I gotta start pre-moving we're gonna, make it happen, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna make it happen. I'm gonna win this. That was close. That was the closest I've come to losing a speedrun game. This guy was incredible but wait. I still gotta win and I got seven seconds to checkmate him, but the thing is at some point: the center is your muscle memory. What I'm doing here is I'm doing something called a pre-move. A pre-move is a move that you execute, regardless of what your opponent does. It only takes 1.1 seconds to make a pre-move, so I'm able to to make a lot more moves now. Here I have a queen against the king. This is one of the easiest checkmates in chess I'll, be able to basically check my name while pre-moving all of my moves and what you can see that I'm doing here is I'm cutting off his king boom boom and, ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a checkmate what a game, what a game and the perfect yeah there's so much to talk about here now. The one thing I want to emphasize is that it's not about playing games fast. I want to make sure I explain everything so that people actually learn you guys shouldn't be that impressed. I shouldn't have let this get down this close um and you know I. I definitely let this slip a little bit in some moment, but he played very well so I I did my best okay. So let's go through this game. Let me unpack everything for you guys, so, basically in the opening okay, when you start a chess game, basically you want to control the center the center. Broadly speaking, is these four squares that I just highlighted in red when you control the center, your pieces get more space and you're able to put your pieces on better squares where they can be better positioned to start an attack against your opponent's king. As you guys know, the ultimate objective of the game of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, to put him in a situation where the king is in check and has no squares, so our opponent was just was just pushing out his pawns without controlling the center, which is why I got a very nice position. At the start, I'm just developing, and here the move d5 was played now instead of this. What should I have done? What I should have done is try to open up this file for my rook, sticky bro. Thank you for the prime. How should I have gone about doing that? Can somebody tell me a plan that I can execute to open up that f file and don't worry I'll, be I'll, be pretty quick here, we'll get started on the next game soon, but you know, if you guys are in in here to improve you want to get better. You know try to engage pay attention. Ask any questions. You want um, no such thing as a bad question: it's okay to make mistakes! I'm we're here to learn. So I say that every time- and I mean it- uh d, the sony thing with the prime so knight d2 would have been correct. I did this in the game. Then we pushed the f pawn to f5 and we take on e6 now. Why would we want to open up the f file? Let's say that he makes a bunch of random moves. The reason we open up the f-file is because it's a direct artery to his king. In fact, white has checkmate in two moves. Well technically in three moves here: check on h5 and then checkmate on f7. You see how quickly checkmate follows after the king is opened up like this um. So that's that's a very, very typical situation. Okay, so instead I played d5 and now I went knight d2. So I did the same thing in this position to try to open up that f. I appreciate it. Brett stick and and loving the fact that so many people have stuck around. We've got seven almost 8 000 viewers, so uh. Thank you guys so much. I really really appreciate it. Um. Okay, so I got my knight to a good square, the move a4. Why did I play it? I played it to stop b5 if I'd gone, knight c4 immediately, he could have kicked my knight away with the move: b5, okay, a4 knight, c4. Now let me fast forward to the moment where I basically almost ran out of time. So takes rook a4 here, I'm just activating all of my pieces sacrificing a pawn in order to open up the center and to get rid of his bishop and essentially now I thought I was completely winning, but he managed to survive so boom boom. We got our rook to a great square and now the fun starts okay. So, let's do this blow by blow. This is called a fork. Okay, not a literal fork. A fork is when a piece attacks, two other pieces. You guys see that the knight, the black knight attacks the queen and the rook, but this is called a pin. It's like a flush and a straight and poke or a pin, is when there is one piece in another piece and they're in the same line or diagonal. Now one of the pieces, that's the piece, that's behind the pinned piece, the pinned piece is the knight has to be of greater value. So a pin is good because the knight can't really move if the knight moves he loses his queen right. That's why this pin is so strong. So it's a fork versus a pin. I moved my queen, which means that if he takes on c4, he drops his queen and a queen is more valuable than a rook, and I moved my queen to b4 to attack his knight, but now he pushed his pawn out to d5 all of a sudden. This bishop opens up attacking my queen and he's attacking my rook. So things get super messy here. This is a discover check. A lot of terminology here, but I'll introduce it bit by bit. The op shot is that this position occurred on the board. This is an amazing position, because here's the thing I could have taken his knight on b6, okay, that's a free knight, or so it seems now. First of all, if he takes my rook, what does white do? I just take his queen right. If he takes the queen, then my rook, which was being attacked, takes his queen and I'm up a piece. But what did my devilish opponent cook up here? What does black actually have- and I saw this at the last second- I could have lost this game. This was an amazing idea. Watch this who can spot it? Who can spot it so rook to you, you guys are- is in the right direction. That's exactly the right idea! There's a problem, though that is defended. You guys have a good eye for tactics you're, seeing the back rank mate, but here's the thing queen to d5 does exactly the same thing now. The queen threatens to checkmate the king, no problem right. It's okay, but wait a second. The rook is also hanging. So in effect this is a fork. Your forking checkmate threat and the rook white cannot defend both. At the same time, it would be nice if the rook could travel to e1, but it can't no matter where you move the rook. You can only block the check, but you can't stave off the mate there's nothing I can do. If I go rook d3 trying to intercept the queen, then c takes d3 and black will be up a rook for a bishop which is a pretty disastrous situation, that's called being up in exchange, and so that is why I played rook to g3 and didn't take his knight, that's hard to see and kudos to my opponent for finding this. Now I play h3. This is the pin. Pawn cannot move because he loses his king, that's illegal, and so I won a pawn and I got a winning position. But at this point I had almost no time- and my opponent continued to defend very well now. There is one very cool idea. I wanted to show you guys this is a fork. I attack his rook and I attack his knight. What if he had gone rook to b5 defending his knight with his rope white, actually has a beautiful checkmating idea. There are several ways to deliver checkmate, but there is one move: that's just very pretty. Who can spot it queen to d8 is the fastest mate, but who sees the pretty mate knows. Nozzle is on a roll. This man and yep rook, hey sacrificing the rook, dropping the king to h8 and queen fate is checkmate. This is a typical pattern. Queen delivers the check. Bishop holds the king back right, no squares, queen d8 also was checkmate. This is like the business approach queen to h8 is made, is also possible or you could go rook h7, so lots of mates here. He correctly gave up a piece I traded queens, which is normally what you do when you're up material. You want to trade pieces, simplify the game and of course here I had like six seconds so I had to try my best, but what I did was that I managed to trade rooks, which made the win a lot simpler for me. Now I tossed his king out of the way and won the pawn and won the game. That's basically what happened any questions, and that was a complicated game. There were some details that I didn't that I kind of left out uh, but but I try to sort of give you the thrust of the game and extract the crucial lessons great opponent. My opponent played very well and honestly. If he didn't play such a bad opening uh. Who knows what would have happened? He gave me a pretty big head start by pushing his pawns out like this um. I think he played like a 23, 2400 or so uh, so big, big kudos to my opponent. Let's go.
