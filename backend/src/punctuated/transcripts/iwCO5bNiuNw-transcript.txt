[Music], let's do it: okay, 1368 from russia all right, so I'm going to jettison the bishop here with bishop a3. All right, I know I know you guys will laugh but okay, this is a serious experiment. So, okay, I'm down a bishop, all right, I'm down a bishop. Now. What do I do? First of all, you don't want to go crazy and give up all the rest of your pieces right, you're already down a piece- and this is true also when you blunder. I see this all the time somebody blunders a piece and then they immediately. Oh okay, I'll sack the rook in two rooks and I'll. Just pretend this was a sacrifice. Let me lose the game like two more moves. There's no need to you know own up to your blunder right. Don't try to pretend that you saw it, and I have really funny stories with that and then sacrifice more pieces out of some sense of necessity. Now: okay, queen f3, now what does he want? What does he want? He wants to take on f6 and potentially he's clearly trying to trade right, but let's use that to our advantage right, because here's what I notice folks, when he takes on f6 with his bishop, that rook on a1, is a little bit weird and he's got a bunch of these dark squares right around his position that are kind of flimsy. So I'm going to go queen e7 here, I'm going to tempt him into taking on f6, because what I, what that gives me the chance to do, is take with a pawn. Why is taking with the pawn good? Doesn't it amen tie? It seems like I'm ruining my pawn structure, but this is actually potentially a blessing in disguise, because what advantage does this pawn structure give me well. First of all, of course I avoid the queen trade. I mean I can't trade queens. Well, it gives me the g file and I also have the b file. So, let's think about what I can do here. One thing that I can do here to try to muddy the waters right and win back some of this material. Look at this pawn on e4 in the time that his king is still in the center. I can try to exploit that in my favor by the way guys, the move queen e5 doesn't actually do very much due to knight c3, so I can go either d5 or I can go f5 I can go either d5 or f5. I will go d5. I would have personally got f5 uh were I playing alone but uh. This is a more thematic move and by the way, don't rush to take the pawn on e4 because taking the pawn on e4 notice opens up the diagonal for his bishop. I want to take this pawn on my terms. What does that mean? What move do I think about playing then? And this f5 right? We want to play f, take c4 and establish a pawn chain so that his bishop remains locked up. So we have already won a pawn back and, as people have indicated, we have that g-file that we can use to stir things up on the king's side. Let's try to stir things up on the king's side. Crook g8, no rocket science. Here I'm just trying to do what I can I'm still lost. I mean king h1 he's very good uh and the other thing is that, despite being down material, that doesn't mean we throw caution to the wind and we just violate all principles right. We still want to develop our pieces uh and- and we won't get any anywhere without developing our pieces and enhancing the quality of this pawn chain. I do actually like the move. F5. Oh, I actually really like the move f5. So let's actually go f5 to really just cement our control over the center, because that's the only thing we have, but now let's develop our bishop uh and potentially prepare castling long. Although I don't think I'm gonna do that. Okay, now I see an opportunity we can attack the pawn on g2 and people have realized that queen to g7 are right now if he goes g3, that would already be a mistake. He's got to go queen g3, but that is not an easy move to find and already he is in a little bit of trouble, because if he goes g3 and I think he's realized it wow, this guy is really good. Actually. So what do we do now notice that the queen is the worst defender? The queen is the worst defender. I cannot repeat that enough. What can we do here? Where can we go with our queen in order to keep yep queen h8 or we can go queen f6 right, a little bit more active uh hello grant uh. Well, I would ask the same of you and, and here's what's going on what's going on and queen h8 would have been actually better now than I think about it. We're attacking his queen his queen, is on a very thin line with his knight, but if we go f4 and open up the attack on the queen, he has knight takes e4, and I will explain that after the game. So this is the time for us to do what we need to make a move before we play f4 and this move. We have prepared precisely for this kind of eventuality we need to castle. We need to get our king out. Don't worry! I will explain this after the game. Why is f4 bad, but this guy is extremely underrated. He's seeing some pretty cool tactical ideas? Okay, so he's got 92. Well, we gotta throw our lots in the center of the table. Let's go four ooh, there's a really cool idea. Oh my lens! Oh, my goodness, there is a really cool idea. I'm just gonna make the move right now, and I will explain it later, because I want him to think that we have blundered our queen in reality. This is the other thing, thank you, sicilian, salad and joshua yalday for the sub, oh, my goodness. Now who can spot? Who another queen sack? Who can spot the sequence? Who can spot the sequence in its entirety? Fake bow test gambit? It was a sacrifice made in three. What's the first move, can somebody give me the whole line? Yes, f takes g2 now what we can even make a rook double check forcing his king on to f1 and bishop h3 is mate. This is checkmate all right, so how did I come up with this tactic? Well, here's the thing I will I will make. I mean that was a yeah. I mean this is a cool tactic, but honestly he should have. He should have suspected something now. Well, I appreciate it. Yeah the hype is real, so yeah the guy is uh he's. I wonder what he's doing right now, 100 bits. Thank you, uh kk detroit for the support uh. He could have done g3, but then I would have won my uh brought my queen aside and this pawn is very dangerous. So the the advice that I can share on the basis of this is that you want to when you've blundered when you're down a piece. You want your opponent to believe that you're, basically tilted and blundering more that's where these tactics come from. He feels like I'm tilted, I'm down a piece. I don't know. I played bishop a3 on move two, and so I'm blundering another queen. You want to lull your opponent into that sense, uh that you're just actually tilting and blundering more pieces, and this is how you set traps right. This is not a prosaic trap. It's actually quite believable right he's like okay. This guy got fixated on these threats on the king's side. He doesn't see the queen. Thank you, dugoterra for the for the two months right um. Now the one thing to point out in this position. We all wanted to play f4 opening up the attack on the queen, but the problem here is that I see this x-ray right. This is what bothers me initially and when we have an x-ray like this, the pawn on e4 is a very, very tenuous defender. Right it can eat. Pawns can easily be eliminated. Thank you, dk runes for the prime and it can be eliminated with the move. Knight takes c4 counter-attacking, the queen counter-attacking the queen. If I take his queen, he takes mine, it's a double check and he takes the rook and if I take on e4, then he can either immediately take on e6 with the queen and trade queens or he can play. Rook takes c4 and the bishop is all his he's got three attackers on it and obviously it is pinned um. So what did I do in this game to create chances? What I realized is that you can first identify what your opponent is trying to do right. It's clear that he's trying to trade pieces. So why don't we use that to our advantage right? Okay, he's gonna train on f6, but at least I'm going to do what I can here to create attacking chances. Rhyming get the g file, I'm going to get the possibility of going d5, and so that's sort of how you do it. You try to spot these hidden drawbacks in the way that your opponent is playing. You try to lull him into the sense that you're tilted that you're not actually calculating, but in reality that's how you've set the trap all right. Why g3 is bad? Well, g3 mean at the end. So what should he have done here? What he should have done is actually taken on f3. I think, although things get very complicated here already, the move g3 right is very logical, because if I take the knight now he takes my queen, there's no tactic in sight. If I take the queen well, then he succeeded in trading queensies up a piece. I would have gone queen h6 here and um. Look at the pawn on f3 right. You can see it. What kind of mate do you think about when you see a pawn like this? What is the sort of tactical um? What tactical precedent does this set? Yeah you think about the lobster pencil mate white can go knight, f4 right and he can protect the g2 square with his knight. But now maybe you go bishop, h3 and guess what uh again there are some queen trades uh some queen sacrifices in the air and at the very least black, can make a draw here. So, whenever you have a pawn like this on f3 uh, that just by definition by definition, that creates a host a host of tactical ideas, uh that are not easy to defend against, not not impossible, but certainly not easy, um shwsa I use chessbase, which is a software that anybody can purchase um. I basically put all of xqc's games in one database. Uh and I ran a well chess base- has a lot of these functions. You can search basically all of white's, all of someone's games played with white by frequency, and I found that he played the scotch uh exclusively, and so we went from there um. He should play queen g3 and he did oh. Why is g3 bad there? Oh yeah yeah, so if he goes g3, the first thing that I see is this right: there's a queen and a knight, and it's spaced one square apart. What does this allow us to do? What does this allow us to do? Yeah it allows us to go d4 fork queen is defending. Now we want to have the order of operations here. Don't just grab the knight, because the bishop on e6 is hanging, so we first take b3 and then we take the knight and we've won the piece back. Okay. So that's basically the reason why he has to defend against the mate and also stop the fork at the same time, not easy to do. Oh, we got another big donut 15 from mega match, 6969 thanks dania for all the great content. Well, it is my pleasure. Thank you for the 15 donation. I really appreciate it all right, so that's basically that all right, let's play maybe two more and then I will wrap up for today. It is getting pretty darn late, so um any other questions. Oh queen h8 was better after queen g3 um, no just scratch that I I thought better of that. I thought so initially, but it's not worth explaining what if he would have done e5 in the first, when e51 here spaniel well, does it do you realize that not everybody is in front of france before I'm not sure where I'm not sure, where you're referring to sorry instead of pawn g3? What about knight to g3 uh, also not sure what is being referred to here so sorry, guys: okay, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna proceed, um, we're gonna proceed and uh we're playing a 1450. So let's go e4 and if he plays knight c6 we're gonna play a rai lopez, let's play ray lopez um and he plays a steinitz which is which is a line, but it's quite passive and in the right lopez you establish this tension. You establish this pit uh, but the rylopez works best. If we have central control, so we can play d4. But, as you guys know, I like preparing the move d4 with a preliminary move, so that we can support our center with pawns and not just have a reliance on the pieces. What move am I thinking about? C3 yep and we're gonna play d4? Next he might play a6 and then we're gonna drop our bishop back all right. He got. He goes bishop g4! I don't care, I'm gonna go db4 um. Now here we have an interesting dilemma right we can go bishop a4, but what I'm noticing is that we have all this tension on this e5 pawn. So let's actually take his knight ruining his pawn structure. Now we're gonna chase his bishop away with h3 and we're gonna yeah he's gonna, take we're gonna take with the queen and let's take stock of- what's happened here. Okay, so he's giving us the entire center, he has terrible pawn structure on the queenside and he's not developed at all. Neither are we for that matter, but we are ready to castle and he is not so already I'm thinking about tactics, because because he is very very far from castling, and that is a very dangerous situation to be in when you're this far from castling. You open yourself up to the possibility of countless tactical ideas, so we don't want to go d5. We don't want to close the center up. In fact, we want to open the center up as much as possible, which would mean what what do we do here to open things up as much as possible? Don't overthink it! He has offered us precisely the way to open up the center. The move c5 is terrible and he makes his pawn structure even worse castles and I will exp well. The reason we don't want to close the center, as I explained, is because we are the ones with the development advantage. We are the ones with the development advantage, and so we are the ones who would benefit from pieces getting access to the opponent's king. So the time has come for concrete action. We can go rook d1, but the best is just to go e5 and at some point you just have to press the button and sacrifice upon and open some stuff up um. This is not such a big sacrifice to where we really have to agonize over it's just a pawn and if he takes that pawn, his bishop lands on the same file as his rook, so he correctly refrains from taking it. But look at his position. This pawn is stopping his knife from developing to f6, and the bishop is now stopping the knight from developing to e7. We could give a check on c6, but but we don't need to, but we don't actually need to and here's what I want to show we're going to go rook d1 and then we're just going to develop. I want to show that in many positions, just simple development and simple adherence to principles, reaps immediate benefit right. Okay, thank you very much and it's checkmate right. We didn't need to give a check on c6. We didn't need to do anything all right, so the by the way. The idea of knight c3 is also to put a knight on d5. He is completely paralyzed, so we don't need to force anything. In fact, I think his king is a bit safer on f8 than it is on e8 and um. I don't see a point in putting the queen on c6. As I've said many times, the queen is often best in a supporting actress role. As the oscar sarah one called the supporting actress sort of in the shadows commanding the war rather than on the front lines, you know getting caught up in uh, the other piece's hair, okay, uh last game, guys last game and then analyze, and then I will wrap up once again. We are white and we are facing a karo khan, so uh I've played it very principally. Let's play the advanced caro, just the most central opening and we're gonna play this very simply right. We're just gonna we're gonna go bishop d3, which is an under underrated move by the way in the carl and now we're going to orchestrate a very interesting plan. The plan that we're going to aim for here is attacking the base of the pawn chain we're going to attack the base of the pawn chain by pushing up the f pawn, but not immediately, not immediately. First, we need to complete the development of our king side, so knowing that the idea is to play f4 f5, where do you guys think I should put this knight? Yep 92 is correct and this is actually a theoretical move. Now, what do we do here? While I already gave it away? Of course we don't want to give up our pawn chain. We go c3 cdcd, so the idea of f4 is the plan, but first, let's complete all of our developments, so that we don't have to worry about that and then at our leisure. We can start making sure that we get that in so he's actually playing this very well uh man. These guys are good. I'm telling these guys are good, particularly if he plays knight f5 right now, yeah he does okay, so he has thrown a bit of a a um, a wrench in the works here, so he's putting his knight precisely on the square that we want to reach with our pawn. We don't want to allow that so that will not do. How do we get this knight out of there? Let's get this yeah, he threw a danny wrench. So the idea that I want to apply knight g3 is the correct idea, but knight iii blunders the pawn. So we first play bishop e3 and then we play knight iii. We also tempt him into taking on e3, which would be a positional and tactical mistake, all right which he doesn't make, because he is helio bacha, the famous now we're gonna go knight g3 get the knight out of there. Now here's the thing if he takes on g3. What are we gonna take with okay? What do we take with the queen of the pawn- and this is a very instructive moment- think about the ultimate goal of the f pawns push precisely we take with the pun. The reason we take with the pawn is because we open up the f-file, and that is a lot more important than the double puns. In addition, look at how nicely the d4 pawn is now defended. We don't have to worry about it anymore, whereas before our pieces have the role of defending it. So how do we? How do we now kind of capitalize on this open file? What do we do when we want to capitalize on a file, not a rook lift but a doubled, rook right? We double the rooks. We go rook for rook f1 and where can this knight on g3 potentially go to increase the attacking potential of our position? Where can the knight go to increase the tagging potential or position? There's really only one square, so not a big choice that I'm giving you precisely knight h5 all right. He takes on c3, I don't care now. The spawn on d4 is very nicely reinforced. Let's complete the doubling of our rooks he's, probably maneuvering his knight over to g6, very, very strong play. We're gonna go rook to g4. We want our rook to remain relevant and obviously g4 is the perfect place to do that. Let's see what he does. No, let's, let's not throw up! No, I mean this guy is playing very well, but um, I'm not entirely. So I'm a little little bit. Okay! So because he's playing really well uh, this slightly changes how I play and what does black want here? What black wants is to go queen c7 and win our pawn on c3. I like the idea of h4, but he can actually just take the pawn you can actually just take well, but we can sacrifice it. Hmm, let's do it. Let's sacrifice the pun now. The idea of sacrificing with h4 is that when he takes on h4 the h file becomes open. That doesn't seem important but more important than the h1. We buy ourselves time to keep attacking. We go knight, h5 and now he's got to go back to g6 and that allows us the opportunity to lift the other rook up to f3 and h3. This is probably unsound at a gm level which uh I with every move. I am convinced that this guy is but we'll see queen c7 now is what I was concerned about, but this rook can double. As a defender of the pawn on c3, we could go e4 and reinforce the defense of the c3 pawn. So let's see how he handles the situation, I could have I well. I could have not sacked the pawn. I could have lifted the rook up immediately, but this, I feel like every tempo here is important. Right he's going to start pressuring us on the queen side, and so it's it's very important to uh to do things very efficiently, um. No, this guy is definitely legit he's just very good um. Yasser was not my teacher. I I just had one training session with him uh, but you know I'm on great terms with him and, I think very highly of him. So, okay, king h8, let's complete our rook, lift and we actually have a really cool idea. Potentially three games in a row of the queen sacrifice. I'm gonna give you guys, potentially three games if he cooperates, and he just did. We are about to have three games in a row with a queen. Sacrifice. Now wait a second. If we play queen takes g6, he takes with the f pawn, but if he takes with the h pun, then we would have checkmate. So in what order do we take on g6? What should we do? We play? Rook takes, g6 f takes g6, then queen takes g6, and if he takes our queen knight f6 is gonna, be checkmate, and that is a good way to end this stream. In fact, if he goes h6, we have knight f6, also nice, by the way um just creating massive threats against this king yeah. This is over um. This is just over now, there's actually some very, very nice details here. If he doesn't do anything, we have an even nicer. Well now we go knight f6. That is the very typical follow-up here, but I'll show you guys some nicer details here as well. Well sure it's been five hours and I played a seven hour tournament before the stream. So I'm right about ready, but uh yeah. That's it 100 bits! Thank you! Kk detroit appreciate it um. So by the way, uh. Let me just very quickly one second. No! This guy is just good he's. Just good creepy crawlies come on man uh, so uh. If he did nothing right, if he played like rook c7, does anybody see the actual mating sequence? Yes, I have youtube and the speedrun is getting uploaded to the youtube and I'm doing things as fast as I humanly can. So it's not knight f6. That's the point of rook c7. It's it's not knight f6, because now the rook actually defends the pawn you well beth. Harmon has to see this queen takes h7 king takes h7. Now g6 is the only escape square which we take away with our knight, and this is checkmate, and this is actually. I actually think this is quite quite pretty knight f4 the rook and the the rook and the knight combined trapping the king in the corner. So if you don't think this is pretty, then then you don't like chess, but yeah. This is uh. This is a nice combination, just basically snapping everything on g6 and if he takes then knight f6 is made, I mean. Actually we can go anywhere with the knight, it's all good, creepy crawlies. I know people are excited, but you know I need my two hours of sleep. Okay, um chess can be beautiful, says beth harmon. I agree all right uh so that basically was the game yeah you cannot go knight takes g7 because then the king takes uh takes on on g7. So it you know- and- and and this is the this is the thing right when we come up with a plan- our opponent comes up with a way to stop the plan. We want to approach that calmly, right and ask ourselves: how can we get that knight away from f5? Well, we go in ig3, but we can't go knight g3 immediately, because that would drop t4, um, okay, so uh there's more to analyze. We have that previous game to look at, but really nothing happened other than this movie five, which opened up the center, and I think most people can understand uh the purpose behind this move uh, and so we might we visit this tomorrow, but in the meantime, guys I will head to bed. Thank you everybody for um. For for the incredible support today. I know that people want. You know people like the speedrun and I'm very, very happy to be doing it uh, particularly given the explosion of viewers uh. So thank you, everybody so very much brought for gem jam [Music]. You.
