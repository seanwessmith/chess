All right we got an opponent, 24 39, let's go, let's go e4 [Music] and uh we're playing as candy okay, so knight c3 is the move boy g-hub subbing himself. Thank you for the tier one. Okay, so queen d8 is, is one of the possible retreating moves by by the queen and uh. The move here is, of course, to play d4 and to develop our pieces, normally knight, f3 bishop out to c4. We seek the most active squares for our pieces. Now. B5 is already pretty weird and I'm not entirely sure. You know what this move achieves other than create some weaknesses. So let's complete our development let's castle. Now, where should this bishop go? Where does the bishop on c1 belong in these kinds of positions? So we just need to find the most active square and in my in my to, in my view, the most active square well y f4, I mean we can put it on f4 g5 yeah. Bishop f4 is a good move because it also supports the move, knight e5, we're going to slam our knight into the center and the bishop. Does a nice job making sure that that knight is is more stable? I also like the g5 score for the bishop, so so why not white is slightly better here. It's not not like black's position, isn't terrible okay, so he plays knight to knight to d5. Now it's tempting to take the knight here, but that would give him an improved center and uh. This is one of those situations where you just have to keep the tension, so we're just going to drop the bishop back and I don't mind it if he takes on c3 and seemingly ruins my pawn structure so after the game, okay, it won't yeah. I won't have to do it after the game. I'll explain it during the game. Why is this uh deficient pawn structure not actually as deficient as it looks? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, he's gotten rid of his knight, which means that if we look at this bishop on b3, it now is operating relatively uncontested along this diagonal. The second thing is- and I've explained this on several occasions- there is a visual deficiency in this pawn structure, but on the other hand, we have a lot of pawns in the center and they are defending each other. So on the one hand this may look bad, but it's actually a very solid pawn structure. Okay, so we should play a4. We shouldn't let him uh trap our bishop: let's go a4 and um rook bishop a6 okay, so he clearly creates an x-ray against my rook. What should we do? How should we respond to this move very simple again, no need to overthink it all right, brandon I'll play one game and then and then I'll be ready for you yeah, so simply rookie one and now you should immediately start thinking about various sacrifices and in particular, what sacrifice or semi sacrifice. Am I thinking about here, uh, looking at these pawns on e6 and on f7, these pawns are quite a bit unprotected, I mean they're, they protect each other, but that's right about it. Um. So there's a very thematic idea here, which is to take on f7 to remove the defender on the e6 pawn. In fact, let's do it knight takes f7, I'm going to do that pretty intuitively, because at the very least, at the very very least, we are going to get uh two pawns and a rook for two pieces, which is already a good amount of material but uh. My bet is that we're going to get more than that. If I play this correctly, thank you software house, for the prime, because if we look around the board, you guys should notice the rook on a what can we say about that rook? Well, that rook is undefended, which means that what are we threatening here in addition to just taking the rook? What how what follow-up okay? So he defends against that. But what follow-up were we threatening? We were threatening a fork on f3. Yes, all right now we really have a have a wide choice and we have to figure out what our priorities are. Now it seems to me it seems to me that it probably makes sense to try to get this rook uh and attack this rook as much as possible. While we have the chance, we don't want to take on f7 prematurely, because that rook isn't going anywhere. It's pinned. So let's go: let's go queen h5, let's get the queen out and let's put even more pressure on this rock. Hopefully that's going to lead to something good, and this concept is a very important one. The fact that we're not in a hurry to take the rook a lot of people would grab that rook first and think later, but uh. We obviously don't need to do that because we're not in a hurry and now um again. We have several approaches to this position. We are still not in a hurry, so we can take other stuff. First, let's play a takes b5, first and notice that this pawn on b5 stops his knight from getting out to a6 or c6, so he's completely paralyzed. On the king side, we have three pawns now and um. You know, and bishop takes f7 is going to come at some point. We still don't need to take. We can still move our queen and we're still going to be able to take his rook at our convenience. Now we have a very crafty move with our queen very clever little move to e2. Could somebody tell me what the idea is of this move? Why are we bringing the queen specifically to e2 and not to say g4 or h3 or d1? What are we accomplishing with this move? Thank you. Caulisten life yeah, so we're looking out at that bishop. He has to move the bishop, but now we think about well. What is he weakened by playing bishop f6? What is he left unattended or at least relatively unattended? If we think about it, we ask ourselves that question well notice that the queen is overloaded, because on the one hand the queen is tasked with defending um f7. On the other hand, it kind of has to take on c5, so dc is a very simple move here, which kind of overloads the queen and uh he can take on c5 I mean I don't see a checkmate there, but in the event that he does, we can just bring the rook in and then we can take on f7 and just crush him in the center and on the king side. So he can also play bishop takes c3. I know. Perhaps some of you are worried about this move. Okay, so he does play queen 65. now notice that we still have not taken his rook, and I look at the rook on a1, and I say this rook could be occupying a super juicy open file on d1, which we're gonna do and only on the next move. When all of our pieces are in the game, are we going to take his rook and go after his king? We had other ways to win. I think we could have taken immediately and done queen e8 and bishop takes b8 I'll show that after the game, but I think this is the most clinical method, because it ensures uh that all of our pieces are in the attack, which gives us almost this kind of insurance right. If something doesn't work out uh, it's it's a good idea to have all of your pieces involved, because then you're going to have quite an abundance of of resources in case what you wanted to do initially isn't as good as you may have thought. Okay, so now we can do what we were planning to do on the previous move. We take on f7 and now between these two checks, queen e6 or queen, eight, which one do you guys think I should give well queen eight is not checkmate, but queen e8 is the better move, and the reason for that is a very simple one. We want to put the rook on d7, but we can't he has got a knight on b8, that's guarding that square, but we can actually just take that knight. We simply win the night, but the point of that move isn't so much to win the night, although that's a nice um byproduct of that the point is to get that get our rook to d7, which is going to be the killer blow to black's king. So black is absolutely busted here, he's out of defensive pieces and his king is just toast not to mention he's now down in exchange, so he just left his center unattended and that's what happens when you do that? Okay, queen g5, we still have to be careful uh because he is threatening checkmate in one move. Now what would be the simplest winning move here? And I always advocate for this rather than going headfirst into the complications, we have a very simple move here that doesn't require any calculation and it wins the game on the spot. So and the move here is well, it's not f3. F3 is a little bit too passive. If we look at this bishop, we can notice that it's undefended, the bishop on b7 is undefended and um. We can either play rook. D7 rook takes b7, but I even like queen between d7 and queens xb7, because that wins the bishop um. You know and attacks the rook on 88 at the same time, so queen d7 and her resignation from black brandon I'll be ready in just a second. So that's basically that um, and that was a nice game. I mean that wasn't anything extraordinary, but it was candy. We developed all of our pieces. Okay, we developed all of our pieces, so so b5 is already a little bit dubious uh, because while this move does grab space on the queen side, it has a there's a negative part to it, which is that it creates a backward pawn on c6 and it saddles him with these queen side weaknesses which actually later came back to bite him so e6 also. I would probably develop my bishop uh behind the well in front of the pawn chain before playing e6, so he developed a little bit passively, although he didn't do anything terribly wrong. Um, 95, 95 and here was, I think, the first critical moment. I think a lot of people would be tempted to take on d5, but this you know this actually helps black bring another pawn into the center. It shuts down the bishop. Look at my bishop. Now it's just biting on this d5 pawn and black builds up this very nice pawn chain and um. You know, white doesn't really have anything to show for. Maybe white is slightly better here. It's very very important to resist the temptation uh to you know to do this kind of stuff to capture a piece just because it's uh it's tempting to do so. Okay, so bishop g3 um and he takes on c3. I think this is actually a mistake. I think this is actually a mistake because it, as I explained it, does two things both of which are good for white. The first is that it leaves me with a very strong diagonal. This bishop on b3 is now essentially uncontested along that diagonal, which creates these tactical opportunities, such as knight takes f7 uh. The second thing is that these pawns are actually good, even though they're doubled, even though they're isolated uh. You know I call this like shedding your skin. We can play the move c4 in the future. Let's just let me just play a random move for the sake of illustration, and the great thing about this is that I can then push my other pawn up to c3 and I can get the best of all worlds. I can disrupt his his queen side pawns and still have that central pawn chain as a consequence of the fact that I have two c pawns. So that's why I'm on a crusade to show people that double pawns are actually kind of good okay, so we a5 is met with a4 and now bishop a6 is almost the decisive mistake. I just think he didn't realize that these pawns, although they protect each other, are very much susceptible to this kind of a tactic. Um. I think that my opponent should have probably done some damage control, maybe gone queen v6 and tried to get this knight out of there as quickly as possible. Although black is already in quite a bit of trouble here, so bishop a6 rookie one c5- and this is really our only chance to play knight- takes f7 if we, if we screw around- and we could also play queen f3- that might have even been a better move, but if we screw around too much if we play the move d5, what does black have here? Black has a very nasty little move which shuts down our bishop. What move am I talking about? Well that and that's exactly what I'm getting too curious. So the move is c4 and we don't want our bishop to be shut down. So we really only have this one opportunity to get the bishop to e6 so that the move c4 is no longer effective. Now, if he plays c4 here uh, then he loses his queen or taking on f7 and attacking his his queen. Now another question would be what what would have happened if he taken on f7 with a king and although he doesn't lose the exchange. Here I mean the king is very easily checkmated, with a couple of very natural attacking moves and his position just collapses here. You should just see that visually there's really nothing to calculate here, so rook f7, bishop e6. He plays bishop b7 once again. If he would have played knight, c6 white supply and win who can find the most technical winning idea? How do we go about winning this and I actually kind of mentioned the correct idea already um, but we can just apply yes, so so we need to get the order right. Yeah, queen f3 is good enough, but even taking on f7 first and then playing queen f3 and picking off the knight. So when your opponent has a weak, kick uh, in addition to looking for checkmate ideas, always look for forks undefended pieces become particularly important when your opponent has a very weak king, because that king is going to be susceptible to various checks and if you have an abundance of checks and chances are, one of those checks might also be a fork. That's why I was paying such careful attention to the fact that his rook and a8 was undefended, so bishop b7, queen h5, and increasing the attack on his queen and now after queen fe, we simply play a takes. B5, we grab a pawn. We prevent his knight from getting out to c6 or a6. The rest of the game is very simple. We need to x ring the bishop. Then we take upon overloading his queen. We bring the rook into the game and then the final stage of the game, where we just basically take all of his pieces. So very simple game. We developed our pieces, we seized our tactical opportunity and then we didn't rush taking that rook on f7. We only took it when we were absolutely ready to take it and we brought our pieces into the game first before taking that rook, which made the attack so much easier to conduct uh bishop d6, oh bishop d6 is probably even better yeah uh. Oh you want to give a checkmate, but maybe black has queen c8 here. Maybe black has queen c8 here and then, of course, you can't give this check, because I'm just gonna take your queen um. What do you mean? B5 seems counterintuitive, you mean eight takes b5. Well, not at all, I'm just taking a pawn at the end of the day, I'm just taking a free pawn. That's all I'm doing so. It's not terribly counter-intuitive to just take a pawn yeah. That was a great game um, and it just shows that if you really adhere to these basic principles, you can be pretty good players and it doesn't always take crazy amount of creativity or imaginativeness to win these kinds of games, we're doing the speedo into 2500 120 points of away okay. So let's play ray lopez. Despite what I revealed yesterday about ray lopez, okay, so he plays a petrov. This is called the petrov defense and there's you know, there's a lot of good good lines against the petrov, but uh one line that sort of flies under the surface. If he plays the move. D6 is the move knight to c4 that's a bit of an odd move because it seems to obstruct the development of the bishop but um. The point is that the knight is very well placed here and we're going to get the bishop out to d3. Not everybody knows this variation. Okay, so d5! That's an interesting move! Okay, let's, let's get this knight out of here. Let's play knight takes e4, and then next thing is thank you for the prime and then this pawn on e4. Can we can we deal with this spawn? How can we deal with this pawn? What should we do so so there's two two different ways of of playing this uh. We can play the move d3 and and try to get rid of it directly, but another good way of doing it is to play the move d4 and either he takes on poisson and helps our bishop develop or he has to let this pawn remain on a very nice central square. So he does the second thing and the bishop can just come out to e2. Remember not every piece needs to be scaling mount everest at any given moment. This kind of development is perfectly good enough and this knight on c4 it's fine, where it is because it's controlling it's controlling a lot of central squares. It's nicely placed on c4, that's not necessarily a very typical square. It's also defended by the bishop. So if he plays bishop e6, which is quite likely, then we don't really have to move the knight away. Okay, so, let's castle and this pawn on d4, we can see that it's only defended by the queen. Okay. So, first of all, let's deal with this bishop. Where should this bishop go? Where should the bishop on c1 go? Should it go to d2? Should it go to e3? Should it go to g5? Well, it shouldn't go to g5 because he's just gonna take it. It should go to f4 we're also blockading this pawn. If he goes g5, that's very weakening, I mean he might go g5, but okay, he doesn't, but that would be a very weakening move. Okay, so now um, I feel like this knight on c4 has overstayed its welcome and there's a very good night, there's a very good night for this square. There's a very good square for this night, where what what am I talking about here? That knight is being pressured? I know, I know that I said we don't have to move the knight yeah, so e5 is one good square, but even the e3 square. I actually like the e3 score because from e3 the knight potentially supports the pawn move d5, which would grab more space. He goes g5. I saw this move the bishop repositions itself to e5, which is a nice central square and he's he's really weak in this king. So, although he starts this pawn attack, it's a very, very double-edged sword. What he's doing okay? Now, let's make the move: bishop c4, let's try to trade off his bishop and soften his king up even further uh. I don't think he's worse here, but it's definitely a bit of a tough position to play for black, but he's playing it very very well. So you know it's anybody's game right now it takes takes now. Our knight is is nicely centralized, but if he plays the move, bishop fc, bishop d6 um- oh he's played this really well uh for sure, but um one way that we can try to exploit uh. The weakness of his king whoops, sorry is is to get the queen out to h5. So let's do that all right, let's go queen h5. Now he can take our knight, in fact, I think he probably will and bliss queen e7, okay. So, ideally, ideally I'd want to preserve this knight he's threatening kind of to capture it. Well, the move f4 allows g takes f4 and then, if rook takes f4, then he takes on e5. So there's nothing wrong with making the occasional retreating move, let's play knight to c4 and then an eventual idea, whoops, wow, 11 wins and one loss, this guy's good, 11, wins and one loss. So let's, let's get the rook into the game. He lost to a 1600, though in bullet, though in bullet hmm yeah. I'm telling you guys at this level. I I keep playing these weird guys. Okay, let's go d5, let's get this pawn into the center yeah; I'm definitely getting the sense that I'm being outplayed right now, but we'll see so, let's go d5 queen g7, okay, let's, let's lock him up. Let's lock up the queen by playing c3. That game had 99 accuracy, no yeah the pacing. I I could sense in the pacing that something was a little bit off. I can sense in the pacing that something is a little bit off uh. It's like you know it's it's the five seconds of move kind of thing, but it's fine, we're gonna! We're I mean I'm still. I have a decent position, I'm definitely worse. Now we're gonna get our queen back and then he's gonna probably play a6. Let's try to disrupt the position with a4. So if it's five seconds of move, how many moves do I have to survive to survive like 40 moves? Okay, so of course, he's gonna think on eight takes b5 and he's gonna think precisely five seconds. Uh, let's go knight c2, let's try to get it to d4 yeah. This is, this is looking quite quite suspicious, but we are going to try give it the old college. Try. If I beat this guy, then I will go down in glory. No there's a lot of these people at this level. Unfortunately, five minute games you, we have seen that it's just it's just unbelievable, honestly, um the amount of people that um but we're not. Okay, oh rook, z3. Ah without rook t3, um yeah, I'm just busted. Here, let's go back to d4 he's gonna, probably play f3 yeah. We we got him down. We we boiled him down to like a minute and a half. The problem is I'm pretty close to getting checkmated here I don't play against entrance. But how do I know this guy? How did how was I supposed to know that this guy is cheating? Well, I don't know. I don't know that he's cheating, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt. We always do. We always give these people the benefit of the doubt and I'm not going to make any claims until we check the game with an engine uh. Yes, the pacing is certainly suspicious. It calls for for checking him, but you know I always bring up the analogy of imagine that you were the one playing really well, you know, would you want it? If people accused you willy-nilly of cheating- and I think the answer is no yeah- it's the five second moves. Okay, so I'm gonna play d5 here I mean I managed to play pretty well here. I think, given the situation, how does he actually win this? I'm not sure okay he's below a minute now, if he goes to work out four, I thought I can give him a check and then go. Okay, he's got an only move here and he takes the same amount of time. Okay, let's play h3 to stop checkmate. No, I don't think he's I mean I'm actually probably not worse. Here I don't know it's just the pacing is so weird. It's literally every move is five seconds, but I think I'm fine here, okay, let's just go queen g3, to prolong the game as long as possible, because I know I'm not gonna get checkmated um. I know I'm not going to get checkmated within the next like five moves, and I have a feeling that he's going to lose on time, or at least I'm going to try to make him lose on time. I mean just flag. Him sounds very easy, but when someone's playing this well, it's not that it's actually not that easy, I'm trying to not get trackmated at the same time. Okay, here's another move. We survived another move, oh king, h5, okay, so let's just go b4 yeah he's not gonna make it. At this rate, king h5, king h4. Look at that idea. No he's gone unbelievable and you know what else is. Oh and there's a mouse slip? Oh my god. We got him ranja moma! Thank you all right. Let's analyze, I'm looking yeah baby strong, oh gee, 90 92.6, but his last couple of moves messed with the uh. Let's see [Music] I mean he's either really good or he's already I mean he he played most of his moves were best. Oh okay, rook f6 is a blunder, though, which is a really weird move. Nobody would ever play that yeah and then he started playing best moves again. Wow king h5 is best okay, yeah, yeah yeah, it's um, definitely very, very, very suspicious, and and that's honestly why we should probably stop the five minute. Speed run, it's very sad, but it's just how it is. Unfortunately,.
