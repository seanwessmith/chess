[Music], okay, good opponent, now um, let's go with the sicilian and c3 sicilian by not a rapper c3 sicilian. So we already know that there are two main responses to the c3 sicilian, um, there's knight f6, but the move that yeah there's knight, f6 and there's d5 striking in the center immediately. Let's go d5 striking in the center immediately and now the battle begins to revolve around this d4 pawn. The question is: can black apply a significant amount of pressure on that d4 pawn? So how do we apply? How do we continue applying pressure on that d4 pawn like what do we do? Yeah knight, c6, all very simple. I talked about this with charlie today and now. Bishop g4 bishop comes out applying indirect pressure to the pawn because we are pressuring the knight and now we need to get these pieces out, so we go e6 and then we're gonna go knight. F6, I mean this is all super normal stuff. Bishop drops back to h5 one sec, okay and now c4 by not a wrapper okay, so c4 attacks the queen. We have to move this queen back. Where should we move it I mean? Is there any particular reason to move it to one square as opposed to another square yeah, so uh, the d7 square is pretty good. So if we go queen e4 first of all, then that walks right into knight c3, the good move, I think, is queen to d7, because at least we keep the queen deployed. So it defends all these squares. But now we have to be very careful about what we do. If we take on d5 and then we move our knight away, white can leap into e5 with knight. E5 white gets a very big initiative, so here we must find a better square for the knight, but it seems that no better square exists, because this knight covers the d4 square. But what can we do in order to guarantee that square for the knight we can actually take on f3 first intermediate move, then this knight gets a very nice central square on d4. That's a key move actually without it uh without this move, black is already busted, I'm not sure. If this is theory- or maybe I did something wrong already- I mean this looks reasonable for black. Let's see how he responds okay, knight c3, I mean we need to keep developing our pieces, knight, knight f6. This is pretty standard. Bishop e3 yeah. This guy is clearly incredibly strong, um, okay, so he wants to take on on d4. Can we support this knight somehow? Well? If we take the bishop, then we let his queen get it get open and our position becomes super cramped. So there's a move here which allows us yes, e5 is correct. I think e5 is a key move and then you might notice this pawn and say well, isn't this pawn a problem? Well, it is, but it's not as big of a problem as people might think it is because we can blockade it with our bishop. We can put our bishop on d6. This pawn is immobilized and uh that pawn might have a counterpart on d4. Should he take the knight now we can finally castle our king and we don't have to worry about the king safety anymore. Let's see what not a rapper plays here. Yeah we're going to castle short, I mean make you min rating with a party 51. Thank you. So much man appreciate it. I'm doing just one or two games of the speed run and then I will wrap up myself because I am pretty exhausted. Thank you, sullen nader, for the prime okay. So now we can castle. Now we can castle and let's see how white plays this position um. Now, how can black play this position? What are our various plans? Well, we see that this is a pawn chain and when we have a pawn chain we need to start thinking about undermining the base of the pawn chain. So the move b5 comes to mind. It turns out that b5 is a blunder because remember his bishop is making contact with the knight and that knight is guarding b5. So if we play b5 immediately and he's going to take the knight and then he's going to take the pawn on b5, but I like the idea of preparing b5 by playing a6, I like that move quite a bit actually a6 preparing b5 attacking the base of the pawn chain. That's not necessarily what I would have played myself um, but it's a perfectly sensible idea. There's several ways you can play this position with black uh attacking the base of the pawn chain is very thematic. It's what we discussed yeah. This is the reason why I was going to play h6 because now he's threatening to take on f6 and we'll ruin our pawn structure in front of our king. That is unthinkable. What can we do about this? And this move that we're about to play is a move that a lot of people hesitate or really struggle to play, because it's a retreating move but, and I've sort of made this point throughout. You should never be afraid to make retreating moves because they are retreating moves. That should not be a reason to not play a move. The move is 98. If we play bishop b7 guys, we drop the pawn on e5, be very careful when you do make a retreating move. You need to think about which pawns or pieces or squares have been left behind. Are you leaving anything undefended? Maybe got to be careful about that. Make sure that you're, bearing that in mind, 98, doesn't leave anything undefended then I wasn't defending anything 94., okay, so that's a good move, but again his activity here is not really as good as it appears again. We can make another. We can make another retreating move right. We don't want to give away this bishop. This bishop is like atlas holding the world on its shoulders, so let's just drop the bishop to e7 and the secondary idea of this move. You guys see this knight on ea. Where can it eventually go? What is the ideal place for this? For this night, we've already discussed the notion that the knight is the best blockader. So this night uh, the bishop, clears out the parking space for the night and in order to put the knight on d6, we would first potentially maybe have to move the knight away from e4, although we don't really have to. We can play knight d6 immediately and now we're in very good shape. This night is, as they say, in russian and eternal night, that knight is completely unassailable. His bishop is biting on its own granite and uh. You could see that white's activity is uh purely illusory. Thank you for for the prime yeah, so g3. Now we have a very well. Let me think, okay, so we have a pretty elementary way of getting rid of this knight. Who can tell me? How can we do that? How can we get rid of the knight, bingo yeah good job f5? The knight must move, then I must move, and then we block gate on d6 and our position reaches epic purple. I mean we have an ideal position in that case and then we can start attacking on the king's side, because our pieces are perfectly placed perfectly situated, and then we can start pressuring him in the center. We can bring more pieces into the game. It really depends on how how white plays, but uh that looks absolutely horrible for white. Thank you for the prime alacius ii. Thank you. Thank you, okay, so d6 I saw this is the last big obstacle that we have to surmount, and this is where I mentioned this earlier at this 2300 level. There are moments when the game literally just devolves into pure tactics, pure tactics, and this is one of those moments. There is no inherent logic for why the correct move is the correct move. Does anybody see what the correct move is? We can win a piece here if black plays super precisely so we don't play knight takes d6, then knight takes c5 and the game is unclear. Okay, I have to make a move. Knight takes f3 check and after queen takes f3, we draw the queen onto a vulnerable square and then guys I everything is under control. Did you not see me play min with full due respect? As I know, what I'm doing um queen takes, f3 f takes c4 and we counter attack white's queen. So if he takes our queen and we take his queen with a rook, this line is not that hard to calculate it's just a bit hard to see the move knight takes f3 because it's not very intuitive to give up the strong knight, but you remember that uh tactics transcends any kind of general considerations. When you can win a piece for no compensation. You want to do that over and above preserving a piece on a good square. I know, but people get nervous and I don't want people to get nervous because you know I know it might seem annoying that I'm sort of waiting it out, but I'm I know how much time I need to win a position like this okay, king h1. So again we don't need to panic here. All we need to do is move our queen. We need to figure out where we want to put our queen such that uh. We disallow any freak threats from him and again in the interest of time. I'm just gonna play the move queen back to d8 uh. If he takes our knight, then we take his knight and the game is over. If he doesn't do that, then, okay, that's a that's an empty check that doesn't do anything and now we're attacking his rook, we're attacking his knight and uh. We're just gonna. Take his rook. Now we're gonna take his pawn and uh. That's it. We are up a rook in an end game. I'm gonna play a little bit fast here, just to um yeah, so he resigns because the game is over. That was a nice game. I mean that was a only a 27 move game, but it was very rich and thank you not a rapper. It was very rich okay, so it was a c uh, a c3 sitalian. It was a c3 cetillion oops, sorry we're just checking okay, it was a c3 sicilian and we played the move d5, which is one of the two main lines. Does anybody remember what the other main line is? What is the other main line in this position? The other main line is of course, knight to f6 yeah, striking the pawn on e4. It's the same idea right. We are trying to prevent white from going d4 uncontested, but here we decided on d5, okay, so d4 knight, c6, knight, f3, bishop g4 um e6, is is normal right, uh h3, bishop h5. I actually think bishop f5 might be a better move, I'm not exactly sure- and here he goes c4. Okay, so um. It's important here to choose the right square for the queen. If we go queen e4, the queen gets tangled up white goes knight c3. This is out of the question. Why not take the knight after hd, so we talked about something pretty similar a while ago um, which is that a lot of people would look at this position and say wait a second. We can take the pawn, and now we can win a pawn. We can. We can take the knight and isn't that the whole point of what we're trying to do. But did somebody remind me what the flaw is in this in this uh reasoning, and if you guys remember, I showed you a game from my own chess career, where I was able to exploit a similar idea. Bishop takes knight check it's very simple, and now the queen is lost, so you want to be careful about putting all your eggs in one basket. This bishop is super valuable. You do not want to give white's bishop this monster diagonal if that makes sense. Okay, so that's why we did this so queen d7, is, is a very circumspect move that queen is is doing the most, that it can be doing, and really one of the early critical moments occurs after d5. Why not d6? Well that blocks the bishop. The main reason I didn't want to put the queen here is because later I thought, maybe I can develop the bishop somewhere. I didn't want to um didn't want to commit to e7, okay, jerry bomb. Thank you for the for the two months. Okay, so hopefully that makes sense so d5. This is the critical moment. Um and the reality is black is in trouble. If we don't have this move, this is the only move actually that I believe that doesn't lose the game, because, let's assume that knight d8, for example, is played. If you just look at black's position, I mean white can just pile up in many different ways, so, for example, g4 and the idea of g4 is to free up one of white's other pieces. Could somebody now tell me how do you nurture the initiative? This is a very natural move, centralizing. One of white's pieces- and this wins the game, never more or less. Thank you for the prime knight e5, this forces, the queen to let's say c7 and now another devastating shot all across all across the board. Fireworks are happening and white is having all of the fun well. Bishop f4 is good, but you can make another move. First, you can give a check on a4 and just look at this white black cannot cover this check at all. You have to move move the king bishop f4 discovery. The game is over, it's like plus 10, according to the computer, so, for example, queen b6 check checkmate on g5. That's one option, so you guys can see how bad this can become, and so you need to identify these kinds of moments in the game. You need to identify moments when you feel like okay, I need to find an only move. I need to find an accurate move in order not to lose, and then you need to hunker down really hunker down and and just search for it be stubborn, and here I I was stubborn in the sense that I don't want to move my knight to d. I want my knight on d4. How can I get it there? Well, the knight on f3 is uh, preventing the move, knight e4 from being a thing, because black loses actually just a piece, not even a pawn but a piece, because the bishop on h5 is now lost. Does that make sense? If you take on e2, then knight takes e2 and so uh. We can't forget about our bishop on h5. We take the knight and we guarantee ourselves this very nice outpost. The position becomes highly unclear. Okay, so knight c3. Are there telltale signs? Well largely it's instinctive, but there are telltale stones. I mean look at the position just visually right. It looks like white's developing a big initiative. I mean he's tempo tempo tempo. Our king is in the center. Those are the telltale signs. It just appears that if I'm not careful, I might just get blown off the board, that's largely an instinctive thing, but it is an instinctive thing because there are telltale signs. So that's one way of identifying critical moments, just like things feel things feel very wrong. It feels like things are about to go very wrong, particularly in relation to your king. I can't give you guys anything more specific, because there are no formulaic sort of methods of determining a critical moment and that's why you train right kelma, see I'm thank you for the tier one. Okay, whoops sorry did not mean to do that. Bishop takes f3 knight d4. Now we of course develop our knight and now bishop e3, we cement the knight with e5. This is another very important move, very important move now um. Does it make sense to you guys why we don't want to take the bishop? Why didn't he trade off yeah I'll, explain that in a second? So we don't take the bishop, because this knight is our strongest piece um. The night is like what would I compare it to. Let me think of a good analogy. Give me a second guys. Actually, let me grab some water and, as I'm grabbing water, I'm going to think of the best analogy to describe the situation. Hashtag dedicated teacher, just um one second, so I came up with the idea of a dam. You know like an aswan high dam in egypt or the hoover dam. This night is like the dam. If the night is gone, the water floods, your position, white- gets all of these pieces in and um as they say in russian. You won't even be able to collect your bones at the end. That's how badly you'll get demolished. So the knight is like the uh. You know the keeper of the of the position. It keeps us away from a big flood, and so we have to protect the knight with e5, sorry for the violent comparison, but hey um. Now you guys will remember okay, so castles uh, you can also say in russian a slightly less violent expression. Uh. It literally translates to you will not carry away your legs, which basically means uh yeah. It basically means uh. You will not be able to escape right. You won't carry away your legs, but it's it's meant in a very emphatic sense like even your legs will not be able to carry you to safety like you're, basically busted, okay, so e5 right now, some of some people um there are plenty of less violent expressions, but there's also plenty of violent ones. A lot of people were asking why bishop takes d4 is was not played and this was possible um and and which way do you guys think I would have taken on d4, not an obvious question by the way which uh pawn should we take on d4 with? And what is the reason uh for that um? Let's see what people think so we have people on both sides of the aisle here, which is always good whoops. Sorry, I did not mean to do that. Um, okay, so the correct move in my opinion is actually sea takes let's debate. Why do people want to take with the e pawn? What's the rationale behind this c takes d5 allows the pass pawn to advance, keeps the king safe for chimpanzee. Are you behind c takes d4 or he takes d4 cc? Okay, so there is a specific reason why I think this move is good and the specific reason involves this little piece over here. Okay, the diagonal for the bishop is opened up. So when the knight moves hey, this is a super nasty check. The king has to move, and now we are the ones who castle so the table's turned white's king is the one which is uh, which is in danger and white has no way to stop issue before so um. This will force white's king into a relatively precarious position, but um. You should also think about it. This way he takes d4 opens up that e file. Now, who does the e-file? Who is the e-file likely to benefit? Well, it's likely to benefit the side that is the first to castle, because the side that is the first two castle is going to be the side that first is able mathematically to put a rook on e1, and the side that is faster to castle is, of course, white, because white is now ready to castle and the next move black still needs to develop a bishop. Does that make sense so e takes d4, I think, is fine, it's not a huge deal, but for the higher rated among you uh, you know. Nuances like these are are what decide games you know. So this shouldn't be sneezed then, okay, why is getting a rook on the file for a spell because you control the open file controlling open files is good. Yeah castling long would be too dangerous, though, if you castle along, I mean if you castle along here. Just if you look at where my cursor is around black's king, I mean white can go before and he can blast open the king position. It will take black a lot longer to do the same thing to white's king, because white has significantly less weaknesses on the king's side. Okay, so yeah e5 would would have also been possible by the way so bishop d6 developing the bishop blockading the pawn rookie one castles a3, and here I would have considered uh h6 by the way to prevent bishop g5. But we played a6 to prepare b5, bishop, g5 and now knight, e8 98 drops the knight back, remember don't be afraid to make retreating moves and uh. Another reason this move is good is because it opens up the path for the f-pawn. So this idea of going f5 e4 comes to mind. We actually won the game with this idea: knight e4, dropping the bishop back to e7, basically kind of regrouping our pieces, the knight from f6 maneuvers over to d6, and the bishop drops back to e7 in order to lighten the load by effectuating, a trade okay, so bishop takes e7 queen takes c7 already white is worse. This is probably a mistake. I think that not a rapper should have maybe retreated back to e3 and kept the pieces on the board because very quickly, uh, I'm able to just wipe white's pieces off of the board. Why couldn't white play before to attack your pawn chain in which position? Well, maybe he could have? Maybe he actually should have played before yeah b4 might have been possible because after cb, a b uh bishop takes before you can play, bishop takes d4 and material equality has been restored. White gets a slightly more free position, although here black is still fine, rook ac8 to attack the pawn on c4. Why drop the bishop back when knight takes d6 knight takes d66, makes your knight a blockade or anyway, that's a good question. So why are we making this move if I just claimed that the knight is the best blockader um? Well, there's a couple of reasons right um. First of all, I want to eliminate white's dark squared. Bishop specifically, I want to eliminate white star square bishop specifically and the reason why is that? Let's say you make the move: b5 uh, first of all, notice that the e5 pawn is hanging, although it may be possible to respond with the move: f6 forking, the rook and the bishop. I actually didn't see that uh. This is pretty calculating pretty far, so no, it would have been possible to go b5, but I thought that this bishop is a bit of a loose cannon, and so I figured if I'm already going to give up the bishop. I might as well take out an important piece with it. Thank you, I'm a black belt for the prime. I have five chasing away the knight and uh. This move works only because of the tactic that ensued in the game. Now, if the knight moves away, then we go knight d6 and then we go e4 and then we can prepare f4 and uh. We have just an amazing position here. All of our pieces are in the game after rookie e8, so this is just crushing so uh d6 right and this is less mysterious than it appears. The point is that you uh you. You try to open up the position and after knight takes d6, the knight no longer has the d5 pawn kind of as an umbrella. I call that upon an umbrella pawn without that umbrella, pawn that bishop can actually slam itself into d5. The position becomes super unclear here. Okay and knight takes f3 check is what wins. A piece knight takes f3. He plays king h1. Now if queen takes f3, who can remind me of black's move, who can remind me of black's move and why does it? Work f takes. E4 f takes e4 and we counter attack the queen. But the important part is that we attack the queen with a rook. If we take the queen of the pawn, then we drop the rook on f8. It's crucial that in taking with the f-pawn, our rook actually makes contact with the queen, and if white tries to desperado sacrifice his queen, then we take the queen with our queen, so none of it works black is white. Is going to be down a piece so uh in the game. He played king h1 trying to trick me, but now we just drop our queen back, and you know this is all a paper tiger. It's water under the bridge because oops sorry keep pressing the wrong button because we're just up a rook and there's nothing to be afraid of. Remember that when you're up this much material, you can basically give up some of that material. I made this point as early as game. One of the speed run like that's one of the most fundamental principles of of uh, converting an advantage when you've got a lot of extra material. You can give some of it away in order to simplify your task. Do not be afraid, don't take that too far, but do not be afraid to sacrifice a pawn or two in order to clear the cobwebs. So nothing like insane in this game right, nothing that I did was like out of the realm of the ordinary uh. It was certainly a very interesting game. It was an interesting opening. The critical moment was really here right. We set the tone by putting the knight on d4 that night on d4 won us. The game in the end, okay, any questions [Music], you.
