So I I'm hoping that you guys are are able to understand these games even though okay 2400, okay, we're playing him again. I don't mind that uh he's a good opponent. So that's totally fine with me. We can rematch [Music] same good. That's fine! That's fine! I mean at this level. Okay, he's thinking, so so, let's go um. What should we do all right? Let's just go e5! Let's, let's see if he plays a rai lopez on us and then I'll be able to demonstrate how I play against the right lopez. He does okay, so um. Well, the funny thing is I'm tempted to play the berlin and I'm tempted to show you guys a little bit about the berlin, because a lot of people are very intimidated by the berlin and you shouldn't be intimidated by it. So I know people are rolling their eyes at it, but let me demystify a little bit for you guys why the berlin is so popular. What makes it so good? Okay, he plays anti berlin. He plays d3 d3 defends the pawn. That's the anti berlin and uh here. The good thing for black is that I actually can so this bishop on f8, okay, knight c3, is uncommon. Generally, you want to leave space for the pawn to go to c3, so here we're just going to develop our pieces. Nothing, nothing new under the sun, we're just going to play bishop e7 and castle and after the game I'll give you guys a little bit of a run down on the berlin, so he tries to do the same thing I did in the previous game, okay, but bishop b3 is inaccurate. He should have followed this up with d4. This is too slow. How can we make him regret this? Well, d5 is decent, but c5 is a buzz or russian okay permanently. These are what we call the vampire teeth. I think we formulated a new term. Someone in the chat did vampire teeth, are super effective at stopping something, and now we can simply develop our pieces without fear of him opening up the center. What are the plans in this position? Well, we have one very classic plan in these positions which is to well. We have the two, let's think about it. This way we have the two bishops which means in general. It would be good to open up the position so eventually, what kind of move may allow us to open up the position and be careful, because the move d5 is way too weakening way too weakening, because e5 is going to fall out, so the move is going to be f5 f5. Ultimately, we are going to prepare to open the file, but- and this is what I want people to understand- we are not going to hurry with this. First, I want to complete my development, okay and in order to complete my development, I want to bring the bishop out to e6, but if we bring it out immediately, then he's going to play knight g5. So what seems to be a good measured, healthy move, h6. Yes, that's also a good standalone move, so that's the logic we're going to develop our bishop in and then we are going to move the knight and play f5. In addition, we create an h7 square which could be used by the knight, but let's not even rush up. Five, let's see what he ends up doing. Okay, can we make any other improving moves before we play before we move the night away, because it's a good idea also to consider the drawbacks of moving this knight away. If you think about the drawbacks of this of moving this night away, yeah queen d7, is a good move. One of the drawbacks is that it weakens the d5 square. So I like the move. C6 knight d5, is not that dangerous because we can take it, but why not reinforce it with a pawn? So we really don't have to worry about it. H6 is not that we know. H6 is not weakening. That's only one small move he's castled on that side of the board, so we don't have to worry about him going nuts with g4. Okay, this is he's grabbing space, but that's all he's doing. Okay, now we can, we can play queen d7, we can connect the rooks, but we can also get on with business. Let's you know guys, let's get on with it. Let's move the knight away and play five. I think we've done enough. The reason I didn't play queen d7 is because I anticipate a future, and I want you guys to tell me what the nicest space for the queen is now we've done this before in many when we play f5 a passageway opens up for the queen, and this passageway is queen e8, queen g6, okay, so we can play f4 and attack king's indian style, but I don't see necessarily a reason to do that. Quite yet, we can also go queen a queenie, a queen, h5 get bingo, so we're trying to be flexible here. Um knight h7, is also well. We keep the knight near the center. I think that's that's the bottom line. Okay! So let's get the queen into the game we are. We are not committing to anything here. Uh I will okay, so he takes what should we take with, and actually this is not a trivial question but um hmm, I actually like taking with the bishop and the reason. Why is a very specific one that I will explain after the game, because we don't have much time actually he's threatening to force he's defending super? Well, we are going to play now the move. Let me think this is not easy. No sacking is not good. Hmm. Okay, let's drop the bishop back, let's prevent, let's prevent g4, let's prevent g4 and now ultimately yeah. That's why I'm moving the bishop back to to undo the fork uh and how do we? How do we nurture our attack? What how do we bring pieces and there's a very, very classical typical plan in such positions, which allows us to bring the heavy artillery in and that is okay, I have to make moves. We have to double up on the file, so my apologies here in advance guys I'm going to play a little bit fast here, because this guy is, you can see that this guy is not folding. I mean that's one of the things you see at this level is these people have stopped collapsing under pressure at least collapsing immediately. If we continue applying the pressure, then eventually you'll see that he he might blunder something but um yeah. We can work on, though we always have to keep in mind the sacrifice. I will show after the game why the sacrifice is just very bad okay, so we can just double rooks. We don't need to do anything about this. If he takes on e5 gray, he opens up the file. That's in our favor there we go mana monarch! Thank you, brian okay. So this is a bit of a trap move because if we take on f4, the bishop on e6 is undefended and he has knight takes d6, but ding ding, ding ding he's put the rook and the queen on the same diagonal. So we can see that bishop h4 is a possibility and I kind of blundered knight takes d6, which would be a really I don't know, but then we take the rook anyway right. We attack the queen now. The point is that I want him to play g3. I really want him to play g3 because look at how much that would weaken his king side. We would just drop the bishop back to where it came from and then the queen would immediately have access to h3. One of the the key properties of any attack is: is this ability to introduce forcibly weaknesses in your opponent's position? He's got a very five head move, let's see if he plays it, that move is queen to e2 okay, so he does sacrifice uh. Now we do have to move the rook out of the the range of the knight. So let's go rook f6, maintaining the connection of the rooks. The rook can also swing as it will to g6 now the rook repositions on another, very nice file. Okay, that is a pawn that we are going to take to now open up the now we have an extra exchange. It makes sense to open up files right. Okay. Now it is a simple matter of improving our piece placement marginally. Until we find an opportunity to capitalize. Now we do want to trade stuff right. I don't mind trading stuff, now, um, let's shift the rook over to d6 and attack this newly created weakness and uh, let's dial the queen back to g6 in order to immobilize the rook and let's blunder upon while we're at it. Okay, now I gotta focus a little bit. We've got not a lot of time, much much better here for black. I should be able to win this game, but um. I want to make sure that I'm not losing this one on time, yeah, I'm giving up a little bit too much here yeah. This is not great. My technique here wasn't very good. So let me just try to pull this one out, guys he's he's playing this extremely well. I have to say these guys are just like insane like beasts yeah, I might end up losing this one. Actually I spent a little too long there dilly dallying around. Oh, my god, I'm blundering, I'm I'm out of gas completely just blundered a rook yeah. I'm gonna lose this one, sorry guys! That was my very bad technique. I mean this was this was coming eventually no, but this guy is just playing game of his life right now. Oh, oh and I oh my god, I've wanted me to I. I didn't mean to make them okay yeah. He he picked up the the pace after after after getting very bad position very nicely done. What can I say? I wonder who this guy is? Okay, this guy is really strong, so anyways um, essentially yeah. I mean everything was going well up until like at certain at a certain point, you just started completely outplaying me um, yeah d5 was correct, so I mean basically everything here is pretty clear and then imperceptibly, I started playing badly, so bishop h4 is bad. I mean knight d6. That was a misjudgment on my end, yeah d5 was was just winning here. D5 was just winning. I mean knight. G3 is the reason I rejected this, but apparently after queen g6 black's just got a huge initiative like bishop h4 and okay g3 bishop takes g3 and um. This was a misjudgment and I- and here he played perfectly the rest of the game- I mean every single move. Okay, I mean black, is black is better here, but my pieces are all over the place and um I got low on time and uh yeah, let's rematch him. I want to beat him. Okay, he's not on live chess, yeah g5, I mean probably I should go here, although it's already not that clear, he gets a lot of activity. Yeah rookie six is good. Bishop d6 is perfect. Yeah d4 is the best move too. I mean this move I didn't understand completely, but apparently it's best and then queen e3 knight c6 is best. I mean he gave me absolutely no chances at some point, so the bishop sack was just not good enough. I mean what can I say, guys he's he should be 3000., so queen takes h3 uh, queen e3 and um, and- and I just don't have any pieces in the attack. I just don't have any pieces in the attack and um, maybe he's doing a speed run too yeah. I'm just gonna check this game and okay he's back he's back kudos to credit to him. No, no he's he's legit he's just he's just severely underrated, so let's go knight f3 and then we'll analyze, both okay, let's play the another alpha. Okay, so e5 is bad. Uh and e5 is bad for a simple for for a similar reason. Well, it's five. Am I I guess I should also not underestimate my own poor quality of play. This weakens the d5 fun. It also weakens this diagonal. So d4 just gives white an advantage, as we already know so cdcd and um okay. So he goes d5 himself. Okay, that's clearly some sort of preparation, so we're going to take on d5. How do we usually follow follow up here? How do we usually follow up here? Yeah knight c3? I guess he's got bishop before, but we can unpin ourselves with bishop d2. We can unpin ourselves with bishop d2. The point is we're attacking his queen. We got the two bishops. Now, okay, that's a free pawn. I don't know what he's doing. Okay, let's just develop with bishop b2 we're just up a pawn. Now I mean white is much better queen to e4, hmm, okay, let's just keep developing with castles, I guess rook d8, but then queenie won. We have to maintain contact with the bishop, okay, queenie one we're up upon. We just need to untangle ourselves. He's super active yeah. He is very active here, hmm. So how should we untangle ourselves? What do you guys think so? 92 blunders moving the night blunders, the bishop yeah? It's not easy, I think we'll start with yeah he's a very tough opponent. I should probably focus bishop d1. Let's play bishop d1, let's get the bishop out, because that bishop was the source of my problems. The bishop was very poorly protected by the queen okay, so he takes the queen that lightens the load a little bit, and now we get an end game where I have very weak pawns all over the place, but I am up a pawn, so this should be should be winnable. Let's go h3 and now um, let's go bishop, c2 or maybe bishop b3 is a better idea. Uh contesting this bishop, okay, rook d3. We need to defend the spawn rook ac1, okay, bishop h3 of bishop c4, hmm, no well black is much worse. No, he is legit. I mean completely legit, just very good, h, a6, okay. So now we need to improve our position um and we can improve our position in in a variety of ways. It would be nice to get rid of this rook now. Bishop c2 is possible because rook takes c3. We have a check the problem with bishop c2. Is I like this bishop, where it is so? What we're going to do is we're going to go nitrify we're going to try to force him to correct our pawn structure. Our pawns are going to get braces for free if he takes on b3 we're going to visit the orthodontist and uh we we like visiting the earth, I mean I don't like visiting the orthodontist, but pawns. Do I don't miss the orthodontist, but the pawns do so knight f3 um, now uh, no! No! No! No! Now, let's move the king out of the well yeah. Let's move the king out of the way and now we're gonna go e6. Now we're gonna go e6 yeah. Well, I have nothing to smile about. I lost that game. Now we're gonna open up the bishop, rook e8, okay, we're gonna, take it. This guy is good. The reason this move is good is now okay. Now we must. Let me think guys. This guy is like seriously good craig tucker. I know that, but the point of this is to be educational, and I know I know it's annoying to people, but normally I can trust me normally I can. I can explain my moves against the 2400 and not get outplayed so now. What we're going to do is we're going to bring the king over to e2 and and try to try to kick the rook away from d3 king e8 isn't is an odd move. I don't really understand it now. He gives us a chance to bring our king in okay, knight, d2, okay, rook, a one, okay, four I'll analyze, both the last games. I don't know thank you gigahertz for the sorry. I missed that five gifted appreciate it. My man, okay, now we're going to expand on the queen on the king side with f4 and we're going to try to exploit our upon majority. Here I mean it's very strange. I mean it's just I'm having a very hard time like making progress against this guy. Okay defend the pawn back to f6. It might be because it's 5 am no. I mean I'm allowed to compliment him. He is playing really well. I haven't gotten a plaque from youtube. I mean it's not that important to me. Why compliment somebody on good play, we're going to tr, okay, g6 h4, we're going to keep pushing the puns he's not lucky he's honey h5. He finds a way to inflect my pawns positively. However, he opens the g file. Okay, now we're going to tuck our king over to c2 in order to buttress okay, this one here I think we can go here and the bottom line is that we have a protected passer on c4. That is going to be very, very strong here check. Oh sorry, here he's going to check me: go rookie, 3, probably okay. We need to win this fun, otherwise he gets connected passers. I think it's a draw, unfortunately guys. Oh this, oh my god! Now, I'm probably like worse c2, I mean yeah, I'm worse. Now, I'm losing probably, although it's not clear, it's not clear. What is king e5, you can now promote, takes takes nc3d7 c2 takes takes c63 f5 d4 takes it's winning; no, it's winning! Now: okay, I'm not implying anything, but this guy is very odd. I mean it intersperses yeah, that's a very strange move at the end to not approach the punt. So, let's, let's look at the games guys, I won't stand for any accusations. Um, I'm uh! You know the thing. Is it's a very tricky situation because again I I always like to say this ex nido. Imagine that you were him and okay, perhaps you're you're good! Your rating doesn't reflect your strength and then you watch the stream and you have like 50 people, cheating and you didn't cheat. You just have this style and you just played well that kind of ruins your day. So I don't want to ruin this guy's day now I'll, be transparent. In saying that, what is odd to me is the fact that there is a huge delta between some some of the moves he makes are terrible, absolutely terrible like not characteristic of a 2400 at all, and then there are other stretches where he plays extremely well, but that doesn't mean anything and that's certainly not grounds to conclude that he is cheating and that's just what I want to make clear so um I I I get that people are not trying to be disrespectful but uh. This is not called evidence. That's just something! That's odd! Okay! So in this first game right, for example, the smooth bishop e3 is um is just bad. I mean d4 is the whole idea of taking on c6 that's the whole idea of taking on c6. So by playing bishop a3, he allows us to establish vampire teeth and stop d4. I guess vampire teeth can be good to be fair, guys. Uh. Let me make a couple of things here since we're on the subject. I don't mind, sharing some thoughts on it. Here's the thing um people cheat for a variety of reasons and you cannot accuracy is a very bad indicator of whether someone is cheating. There are cheaters who plug every move into the engine. Those are the most obvious ones. There are also cheaters who who will play. You know a stretch of the game with an engine then they'll turn the engine off and they'll turn it back on again, or they will turn it on when they get frustrated at having a bad position. Um. There are also people who try to disperse suspicion by playing the occasional blunder, or they will deliberately make a horrible move here and there precisely to disperse suspicion. That is what makes some cheaters so hard to catch, because it's a very fine line. You also don't want to falsely accuse people um. I think that some people imply this guy fell into that category, but uh. There are very advanced methods and I do not have them so in the absence of those methods, it's innocent until proven guilty. There is this and I I would call this soft cheating where people cheat and they still maintain about the same rating uh and I don't know really what is in the minds of those people, but you know sometimes it's out of frustration or it's the occasional crutch. It becomes an addiction. I think. Oh, let me just check the computer here. Let me just check the computer there, so this this categorical statement no way a human plays. That way I mean, do you know every human? Do you know what goes on inside of his mind? You can't really say that there are moves which you can say. No women will play that, but you've got to be very careful before you say that I, but I know that jimmy fallon and you know the picture of jimmy fallon and yeah. It's a little bit odd, but at the same time it's just it is what it is. So in this game. I think everything was clear right and let's try to understand when you lose a game, you want to get to the bottom of what it is. That went wrong exactly uh, and I did everything perfectly up until this point. So I think that the the um root of my mistake- and this is a lesson that I will actually think about tonight- uh as I lay in bed- is the fact that when you see a tactical property, I just got too cocky. I did not stop to consider the drawbacks of the move: bishop h4 so yeah we are applying for a new mod. So the main mistake is that I basically I didn't stop to consider the drawbacks of the move and had I noticed that d6 would have been hanging. I would have played d5 that solves the problem of the d-pawn. So after bishop h4 things just get very, very messy here, okay and then I made a series of small mistakes to follow that up and and lost the game in the end right. No, I know you guys said d5, but it's not that I'm not listening. It's just I. I am making my own decisions at the end of the day. Some of you did call this move again. I thought after d5 knight g3, I wouldn't get a chance to play. Bishop h4 now don't ask grandmother's rating, is that is a dirty secret um, so queen four queen g6, I guess the point is now. Bishop h4 is super strong, yeah, so, okay and uh after that things got very, very messy, and in the game that I won uh, the opening was very, I mean it was odd. This move97 just gives the pawn up. That's another thing like I don't know, I mean at least play e takes d4 or e4 and white is better in this position, because I've got the two bishops but um. This just gives the pawn up. The key move really here was to play bishop d1 to identify what's wrong with the position. The bishop on e2 is super weak and it's subject to attacks like knight f4. So bishop d1 takes the bishop on a defended square, and this is to the point that not every one of your moves has to be super glamorous right. Your moves have to be functional; they don't always have to be glamorous um. So you know in this end game I kind of ground him down, but he played very very well honestly guys, I'm really tired. I maybe I'll I'll talk about this end game tomorrow, but I'll. I will take specific questions about this game. Um yeah bishop d1 is hard to find because it's a retreating move, retreating moves can be invisible moves here. I wanted to open up the file basically- and here I did something very similar to what I did in my first game against him right. Remember this position where I brought my king over to do something the king can be. The king is like a mercenary. It can be employed for these small tasks that may involve uh the main mouth chasing the rook away. Okay, so that's like the the bottom line right. The king is a. We can consider a weak piece, but it's capable of doing a lot of stuff getting a lot of stuff done and uh. Here we chase away the rook so that this rook is then able to move [Music].
