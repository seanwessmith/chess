[Music], okay, so let's play a uh, let's play another sicilian and we have been playing mostly the accelerated dragon in the speed run and this guy plays what's called the rosso limo bishop b5. This is kind of like the rye lopez against the sicilian and if you are an accelerated dragon player. Thank you broken sloth. It's a good idea to play g6 here anyway, because that keeps things consistent, holy smokes, sc, nes all-star. Now, which way should we take on c6? Thank you for the five gifted mom man girl. What should we take on c6 with so we can take with the b-pawn toward the center, but I'm actually going to take with the d-pawn and after the game I'll delve into the reasons for this, but basically it's a good idea to open up our bishop and it's also a good idea to open up the default. Thank you. Veena blair for the prime. Now we're gonna play the move e5. The idea of this move is to clamp down on the center. Where should we get this knight? Okay? Where should we put this knight? It blocks my bishop and again I will explain the opening in a lot of depth. Absolutely we should get it to e7 for two reasons. First of all, we don't want to blunder the spawn. Second of all, we want to be able to play a five later now our opponent plays c3 he's not actually threatening d4 one two, three four one, two three simple counting: we can absolutely go even if he did play d4. That would not be a problem because it would open up our bishop. Our bishop has a lot of potential energy. What do I see here? Yar? Thank you three months at once. Okay, so the pawn on d3 is weak. Pawn on d3 is weak. How do we attack it? Who can tell me the two main ways that we can pressure that pawn? There are two main ways: we see a weakness. We want to attack it. The first is the very brute force method, no c4. Actually he can just take gypsy. Thank you, yes, versus to get the bishop to a6. Second, is to double up on the d file. Let's do let's try to do both q, q and d prime: let's go f6, never play f6. I hear you say it's not a problem. He doesn't have any pieces to exploit it with right, it's okay to play f6 temporarily, and now, let's do the other thing queen, d7, rook fd8 is going to be our idea to pressure the pawn on d3. I hope everything's making sense we're playing the 2300, so I'm playing a little bit faster than usual, because if I get into time pressure against this guy, I might land in in some trouble, but hopefully everything is making sense. We're just trying to attack that pawn. If we're able to win the pawn, then guess what his position is going to collapse. Okay, a5 we're gonna, go b5 get out of c4. Now what he's accomplished here successfully is he has managed to block in our bishop but uh? That's still! Okay! Thank you, ryan. Okay. So what should we do? Well? Actually, let me think for a second guys: hmm, actually, this guy tricked me a little bit here now. This idea is to go bishop e3, that's why this is annoying. His idea is to go well. B4 actually might be what we want to do here. Um this pawn is weak and I didn't pay enough attention to it. So, let's think about this for a second okay, hmm yeah. We need to find a good move here. Okay, we're gonna, go queen, e6 and I'll. Explain this after the game. We're gonna go queenie, says by and large our idea is to defend against queen b3, and now we want to prepare b4. So previously, the move b4 would not have been good because he would have had this very nasty little check on b3. Now we are able to play b4 and we're able to combine it with the move. Rook ft8 attacking. Why not rook 88, because the pawn on a7 might be hanging later, and I want to make sure the rook on 8 supervises that for now, okay, okay, so the battle now revolves around the pawn on d4 all right. How can we go about putting maximum pressure on that pawn and think about it? This way there's many ways to do this. We can double rooks, that's absolutely true: let's do it. We could have also gotten b3 and chased his night away. This is a very complicated position. I don't have much time on my clock. I'm gonna have to play a little bit fast. I warned you guys about this. There will be situations where I don't get a chance to explain thanks to the level that I want to explain that, but right now we're going to chase his knight away and we're going to dig a little hole for him here and we're going to do that by going c4 we're going to bury his knight on a3. Basically, that's kind of the rationale behind this. This guy is really really good, actually really good. So I'm gonna have to accelerate the pace a little bit, but the bottom line here is: we still want to play on the d file and he tries to unbury his knight another very good move. Okay, it's a little manga s here, but we'll be fine, no they're good. These people are now good. Now, let's um, let's improve the position of our bishop, let's put it on a square where it's defended by a pawn. Okay he's getting his knight to a better square. Let's do the same thing: let's reroute our own knight to d6, let's reroute our own knight to d6. Okay, so far, everything should be making sense, we're just sort of maneuvering our pieces to better squares each one of us and now, let's cement our bishop with a6. I don't want to worry about this pawn being in a dark square. So, let's make it defended. No, no, it's okay! I I usually will be able to talk. This guy is extremely underrated, so I'm going to have to be so now we're going to get the bishop to a better square channel, no 5x! Thank you for the gift. Now, what's going to be our plan, our plan is eventually going to be to pile up on the d-pawn, but before we do that, we want to make sure our pieces are on better squares. Now we're going to go knight f7 in order to open up our rook so that they can give pressure. Okay. So he he decides to open that which way should we take? Who can tell me, which should we take with the knight or the pawn we should take with the very important, not the knight, actually, we should take with the pawn. The reason we shouldn't take with the knight is because it would have weakened the d4 square. Now we take the rook and who can tell me where we put this rook. Where do we put it d7 d6 d5, all the way to d3, we put it on this beautiful outpost and now, let's bring our bishop into the game with bishop h6. Actually that wasn't great because of bishop e3, but you do something that wasn't great no problem. We just bring the bishop back, it's okay and now, let's go h5 to pressure his knight. Okay, now we're starting to really really put the heat on him. Another idea to consider would be c5 to lock out his bishop, so it remains stranded on b6. There's a lot going on trust me guys if you can tolerate this um I'll, make this worth your while I'll make this really instructive. There's there's a lot of concepts to unpack um, so there's a lot of concepts to unpack here through the lens of this game, and now I'm gonna activate the bishop. Look how I'm slowly, but surely I'm pushing him off the board and actually he just trapped my rook, but even that's fine. We can just sacrifice it yeah. This is this. Guy is actually like. I would say I am. I am strength easily he's. I am strength easily. Okay, let's go knight. Five! I'm gonna sacrifice the exchange that rook is gonna, be replaced with a beast of a pawn though, and um [Music]. Okay, let's go queen e6 to defend the fun. Oh and I blundered this uh, I'm getting nervous myself. Okay, let's take yeah we're gonna sacrifice on h3 yeah. These russians are freaking good, go back. These russians are freaking, really really good. Okay, knight h3 sacrificing the knight. If he takes it, he gets checkmated. I think he maybe he knows he's playing against my speedrun again he's bringing his a-game okay, I'm trying to checkmate him here on h4. My knight is restricting his queen, this guy, finding all sorts of stuff, and he wants to checkmate me now. Oh, no, that's actually not good um. Okay, let's get our night back! Another really good move jesus yeah! He might just be beating me here. Hmm, it's taking a long time now. I think I'm winning, because I got this beautiful passer. Look at this passer guys. This is going to win me the game and, in the end, I'm going to just get my king around and promote this guy was really good. I'm telling you I really tried this guy was like gm strength, um. That was like a really solid game for me. Actually too jeez. No, I think here he's lost because because of h2, my apologies guys I'm sorry for not explaining stuff at the end. But let's unpack this and that's how we'll end the stream, this will be um and we crossed 2100 perfect. So trust me I'll make everything understandable. Russians are just built different, well yeah. This guy was a just incredible. Okay, you want to do you want to do one more instead of analyzing. Well, I feel, like I feel like analyzing, is going to be important, though, because I know that people like me to play but um but analyzing trust me is it's gonna pay off, okay, so accuracy was probably low because we were in time pressure. I wouldn't put too much stock in the accuracy um, because, because um at the end, we were both scrambling but 80 percent. It was 79.1 and mine was 87.5, so I've actually played really well gemsy b5 gifted subs yeah. I know I know I was checking the accuracy. It was 79.1 to 87.5 um, okay, which is solid for blitz all right, so he plays the rosalina, but should be five. Okay, now um the idea of this move yeah, it's like you're playing the rye lopez against the sicilian uh. It became popular really only in the last couple of years. It features very often at the high level, and we get this kind of position. This kind of structure now there's good news and bad news for black there's good news and bad news for black. The good news for black is that I have the two bishops and um. I have a nicely fiance bishop. The bad news is uh. You know there is a pretty big defect in the pawn structure. The reason I didn't take bc by the way this is a legitimate move is um. Well, you guys know that I like developing the bishop on the main diagonal now, I'm gonna have to waste another move and also uh. Let's go at it from the perspective of why dc is good. The reason dc is good is because in a position like this- and let me know if this doesn't make sense, you guys see how big of a clamp I have on this d4 square. This square is completely mine. That makes it very hard for him to free his position up in the center. If we do the same thing after bc. Watch what's going to happen. If you go e5 right, compare this position to this position, you literally have. Let me actually make the same. You know the same moves right. You have the pawn on d7, which makes it possible for him to go d4. It's like a marotzi bind, he goes d4 and he opens up his position now. A lot of people were thinking what we're saying doesn't e5 block our own bishop and I need to come back to the point that I always make here about chess being like an omelette at this level. You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. I repeat that, like a broken record, all the time um. So sometimes you need to accomplish something in chess and that involves making one of your pieces. Bad there's, also a famous saying, uh, originally formulated by a romanian brand master mihai, shuba, who said bad bishops, defend good pawns and that's a very profound thing to say, because the bishop itself might look bad, but it's still like atlas holding its worlds, holding the world on its shoulders. It's defending the pawn on e5 and the pawn on e5 is actually incredibly strong. It's a beast so, rather than looking at the bishop as one heyman budge as one kind of unit, think of the bishop and the pawn as one unit think of this as one unit and together they're accomplishing something great. The bishop is like an extension of the pawn or the pawn is an extension of the bishop. Thank you, the real, mr parent for 500 bits. Thank you. So much does that make sense, so that doesn't mean you have to willy-nilly. Go around make all of your pieces bad, but what it does mean is that sometimes a piece may may be bad in the sense that it doesn't control a lot of squares, but it may be in charge of defending something: that's important: okay, they're, a unit they're, a team. That's why we put the knight on e7 another 500 bits jayrud, my man guys you're spoiling me um 97, because knight f6 would blunder the pawn and it would interfere with my control over d4, so 97 c3, castles and d3. So c3 was not a good move because he weakens the square now upon his weak. We have two ways to attack it. We can simply double on the d file or we can put the bishop. My six, I actually think this was an inaccuracy. I think I should have probably started by doubling on the d file that might have been a little bit simpler. Thank you, gm shadow for the prep. My opponent found a very good idea in response to it, which is to get the knight to c4 and block the bishop, also something I want to point out a lot of people confuse attacking a weakness with getting rid of it. Don't play a move like c4, because that actually helps them get rid of the weakness. Um and that's something. You've got to keep straight in your mind when you're attacking a weakness be careful about doing it with the pawn, because that might help him actually get rid of it. So b6 bishop, a6, knight, c4, now um, I played f6 in order to defend pawn e5, but there was one thing that I underestimated here. In addition to weakening the general king side, could somebody point out to me in the context of this position? What is the secondary weakness of the move? F6 this? This move facilitates something that he can now do easier, and this is begins to be a headache. So not the e6 square because he cannot but yeah, but he can't get his knight there remember the concept of inaccessibility. First of all, it weakens the diagonal, but second of all, what idea does it make simpler to achieve for white? Remember, yeah, good, so d4 is now easier to achieve, because the bishop is no longer controlling that square and that's going to be a headache. In addition, it weakens the diagonal something I also underestimated so a4 he pushes his pawn to a5. What is his idea? He has two ideas. The first after I go b5 is that my bishop is no longer attacking the pawn. The second is he's weak in the c5 pawn, which you can now pick off by playing bishop e3. I didn't quite you know. I think I underestimated this stuff, and at this point I began to realize that the position gets really complicated. So if we go rook ft-8, he counter attacks this pawn with bishop e3 and it's not easy to defend the spawn and attack this one at the same time. So after a5, could you go rook fda? Yes, but um here he can play queen b3, creating the possibility for a discovered check, and if you move the king, he takes the pawn, so I think I actually kind of had to go b5. So why did I play queen e6 at this point? I realized that if I play b4, he plays cb and, as many of you have internet, what does white have we talked about this during the game. Yup, that's why it's all going to go on youtube. He has the very simple move queen b3 check. Now some of you might look at this and say: well, that's not a problem right. You can trade pawns, but it is a problem. We were supposed to win the pawn on d3, not exchange it. Also. This is just disgusting. I'm not gonna allow this. I don't want to just give up this one, so I played queen e6 in order to cover once and for all this diagonal, and what I wanted to do was reposition my rook on d8, the rook being the more weighty attacker. Does that make sense? So he goes bishop e3 and at this point my resources are starting to get stretched. Then so I go b4 and rook fda. Now the difference between this scenario and like this scenario is that the position is a little bit more closed, which is in my favor. If he plays bishop takes c5, I can go. Rook takes d3 and attack his queen and fork is one. This is actually good for black um, so d4 by white, emphasizing the secondary problem with the move f6, and this is where things get super complicated. So let's understand this position from a broad perspective. I always like to talk about the zen of the position or what the game is revolving around, and that makes things easier to see what the game is revolving around is control of the d4 square scenario. That is good for black. Is I win this pawn or I'm somehow able to put enough pressure on the spawn to make it collapse? The scenario that works for white is, you know, he's able to get to my weak pawns on the queen side and he's able to retain his control over the center, which is why I double rooks that shouldn't be a mystery to anybody. Doubling rooks increases the pressure on the d4 pawn. This should also not be a mystery to anyone. How do you decide? Well, it's just visually obvious right. I mean look at how many attack look at how what everything is attacking and defending the square. There's like a million sources of tension. One dollar! Thank you, mr glocks. Did you get my other donut um? I think I might have missed a donation, ten bucks for mr twox, I'm so sorry. I missed that uh yeah. I would recommend playing 10 minutes if you're 1k. Thank you for the 10 bucks. Mr block, sorry for missing that I would say 10 min 10 minutes for now, so queen c1, why does he play this move to unpin himself from the d file uh? If I can complete the doubling of the rooks, he can take the pawn. So that's why I go b3. His knight is the defender of the pawn on d4. Therefore, we remove uh the knight, okay yeah, so for now the game is revolving around that now I don't want to play. The move c takes d4. Why? Because that would open up the c file for his queen. He made a very forward-thinking move by putting his queen there. I don't want to let his queen have any access to square so that that's why I played c4 trying to bury his knight on a3. The problem with this move is that it it dries up the structure on the queen side. It opens up the diagonal for his bishop after he takes, and my own bishop on a6 is now also kind of lame. Yes, bad bishops defend good puns, but you don't want to take that too far, so qui outus, potentially, but probably not now, because that would be premature, so I double the rooks. He gets his knight to a better square. Now I get my bishop to a better square where it's at least protected by a pawn. Now he makes this very ray: lopez-like maneuver, getting his knight to the queen side. I get my knight to the center and he goes king h2, which is a very russian school of chess move. He just like improves the position of his king. He gets it away from the danger potential danger zone and I also make a russian move. A6 reinforcing the bishop and also the pawn on a7 is annoying me because I could imagine a future where he takes on e5 and he can take the pawn on a7 if my rook ever leaves decent. Hopefully this is making sense so for rookie, two uh getting his rook to d2. He could have played rook t1 also, and bishop f8 is how I tried to solve uh. You know it's just sort of a waiting move. Well at this point, the battle has shifted right. When I play the moment, I played c4. The battle has shifted from the d4 pawn, which is still a hot hot spot, but now we enter this sort of maneuvering phase, both of us. You know we sign a little cease-fire. There's no immediate threat that either side has so there's a mutual understanding that both of us have to improve our pieces before the battle heats up again. Does that kind of make sense so he improves his knight? I improve mine. He gets his king to a marginally. Better spot improves his rook. I improve my bishop. Now I drop my knight back to f7 so that the g5 square is covered now here, uh knight takes e5 is tempting, but it would have yielded this beautiful outpost on d4, which is not what I wanted to do. Well. Uh, tobias chess, bishop, f8, bishop h6 is not a problem. I can even trade bishops and drop my knight back to f7 with tempo. I wouldn't really mind the trade of bishops right, so I can talk about this forever, but, let's so bishop b6, I think he made a mistake by taking he. He shouldn't have given up the defile like that, and I have now won the battle over the d file in a certain sense right. Rook on d3 is beautiful, and now I start improving my pieces. Bishop h6, I forgot, he can drop his bishop back, so we repeated moves and instead I went h5 in order to get his knight away from g3 and try to push him back run him out of the gym. Now I go c5 in order to lock his bishop out of b5. The bishop is in jail at this point. I think black is much better, but I made a big mistake and he found an absolutely brilliant idea, so here I played queen d6. Why get the queen to the default? What is white's idea here? Why did he play queen e1 like? Why is this necessary? And so he wants to trade rooks. The stroke on d3 is like a bone in his throat. I don't want allowance to trade rooks. I want my rook to remain on d3, but I made a very key mistake. I didn't ask myself what he wanted with this move: knight t1, not h1. I didn't ask myself what my opponent wanted. I simply didn't realize that knight f2 was his idea. Well, rook d1 is strong because the rook on d3 is strong. I don't want to get that. One treated, I think I had a beautiful prophylactic idea here to stop knight f2, and that is the move knight g5, who sees how knight f2 is met like how is this met, the idea of knight g5 and you should immediately see the forkability of the knight on the rook of the king and the queen. Sorry, neither of the pieces I just mentioned were correct. Rook f3. He can't take the rook because of knight takes f3 check with the four and uh. I think this would have been the correct move, but instead I played bishop h6 well, h4 rook takes f2, the line goes on, but we won't talk about that now and I lose the exchange and it's important not to panic in this situation. First, I give a check on f4. I wanted to soften him up with g3 so that I can then get my knight to g5, but he correctly got his king back to h1 and I decided okay uh. The thing the good thing here is that even if he takes my rook, the rook is replaced with a pawn. That is also a beast, and I can potentially support that beast by going to c4. Now, why didn't I go c4 here? That is a very tempting move. Who can tell me what drawback the move c4 contains and frees the bishop bishop gets out of jail, get out of jail free card? I don't want to get the bishop out of joe. My big chance here is the fact that the bishop is in jail um, because that gives me the possibility of attacking his king with one of his pieces essentially incarcerated. The problem, though, is I don't, have the resources necessary to guard the pawn on b3, and I panicked here not really. I actually found a cool idea, but I had no choice but to let his bishop out of jail with queen e6 now the problem is taking on. D2 would not be good, because my dark skirt bishop is my main attacker. I don't want to trade, but maybe I should have done that. I don't know when e6. My idea here was to capture on h3, something that I did a little bit later. Knight takes h3 knight takes h3. Why can't he take the knight, because I played queen, takes h3? Now I give another check on h2 with a bishop and regardless of where he goes, I win his queen and checkmate will follow soon after so knight takes. H3 is a good tactical idea. This at least at least wins back upon, and now my knight is is very nicely positioned on an outpost. I further the outpost with 92 and now queen f6 was a very good move. What is the purpose of this move? The purpose of this move is to tie down his queen to this diagonal, because if he moves his queen, he gets checkmate, but he found a beautiful way around it. Queen f2 is so strong, and if I do just about anything here, he gives me a check and then another check, and he drives my king out and that's not going to end well. So I left the bishop out of jail. That's why I played knight d4. I need to intercept the queen's access to a7. He still gave me a check. I could have probably repeated moves with a draw, but I didn't want to draw so. I was able to park my king on h6 and the reason that the game isn't over. That white is not winning is because of this pawn. That is my biggest asset, and at this point I decided to trade queens because he's threatening the very nasty move, rook v6 now most people wouldn't really do this because we're down in exchange in an end game, but I would argue that winning. This is not simple at all again, because the pawn on d3 ties down his knight. So he can simply do nothing and make a draw. But my opponent and time pressure started to panic. The move h4 I didn't just make for you know for no reason. I anticipated a future where I would be able to eliminate this pawn on g2, and so I preemptively advanced my passport. Thank you. Xa1 cap, 03 and x and rook takes p5 was very panicky. He shouldn't have done that. He should have probably gone about winning this position by coming around to c3 and trying to snag the pawn on v3. Slowly but surely not easy, but doable, but in time pressure he sacrificed back the exchange. The position remains very unclear, but now I was able to get my knight to g2 pave the way for the pawn and he lost on time here. So maybe white can draw by getting the king to g1, although it's very, very close, I do think black is actually maybe winning. I don't know who's winning. Maybe why is he winning? I don't know so anyway, he lost on time here in a very unclear position, very rich game. You could see how many stages this game had at first, I was out playing him. Then he found this very nice idea that introduced a lot of weaknesses. In my position, the battle was revolving around the d-bond for a while. Then we locked things up. We had a maneuvering stage where we both improved our pieces. Then the position opened up again and we had the defile stage. Then he trapped my rook. We had a stage of the game where he was up in exchange, so you know so many different places that we visited in this game and I hope that I was able to at least partially clarify the motivations behind the move. It was very complex. I could talk about this for for hours uh, but you know this guy played an unbelievably good game. You know, so you can see how the higher rated you get really this stuff is very complicated. Even for me, I have to fully engage with the position against players like these and I'm capable of making misjudgments and mistakes just like any of you guys. So hopefully this gives you a certain sense of inspiration. I you know like a move like b5, I played mindlessly, not realizing that hey. I was gonna pay the price for this weakness. It's just that my mistakes are maybe on a more subtle level, but that doesn't mean I don't make them, and that doesn't mean uh that I don't commit the same kinds of hallucinations and misjudgments that any of you guys do so you shouldn't put anybody on a pedestal, um, okay, so any questions [Music].
