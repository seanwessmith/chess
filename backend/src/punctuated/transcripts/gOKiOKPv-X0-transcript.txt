Platinumba 2042 I'm going to start playing different openings by the way. Now, let's continue playing the king's indian, though no rookie is not senseless. You have the f8 square there it again with the close position. You can move back to f8 okay, so we have a kings, indian, castles and uh e5. This is the main line. This is the main line of the king's indian and my opponent. Now we're playing serious people. He plays the petrosian variation. The trojan variation is where white immediately pushes d5 after the game. I will talk a little bit about king's indian theory. Now, one of black's main ideas in this position is to put the knight on c5 the move. D5 has weakened the c5 square and from that square black can attack e4, but there is a problem. If you put the knight on c5 prematurely, white can chase it away with the move b4. So a very typical king's indian move is to play a5, preventing b4 and preparing to deploy the knight to c5, either via d7 or via a6, okay bro. This is basically prophylaxis. It also grabs space on the queen side and that's good as a standalone phenomenon. Now what is the main plan here for either side white prepares the queen side attack and black attacks on the king side? What does it mean to attack on the king's side here? There is one very typical idea that basically starts out all kings indian attacks on the queen side. Could somebody spell out this idea for me now, let's be general, though it's to move the knight and then to push the f pawn out to f5, but we don't just want to shove the knight anywhere we want to put the knight on a square where it also does something, and one very typical maneuver is to go knight h5 with an eye toward going knight f4. We don't need to go knight f4 immediately, but that's something we can keep an eye but wait a minute. Let's support the knight on c5. First, before we go five, how can we do that? How can we make sure that you know this knight is very nicely supported before we play f5 another typical king's indian move? We can play the move, b6 very patient, very patient move, and now I'm going to show you something kind of cool, so white is threatening before he's not actually threatening it and I'll. Show you guys that too, after the game, how can we prevent that we can play a4 but wait. I hear you saying, and he probably is going to and that's a mistake we give upon. Have we blundered it? No, we haven't we've sacrificed it. Why have we sacrificed it because of something called the dark squares? Now, how can we exploit the dark squares in the fastest possible way? Not the b file, the dark squares? What can we now do? What move is possible knight of four is typical, but I want something nicer. Bishop h6 this by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is at another very typical kingdom. We are setting up some beautiful ideas. We are actually threatening checkmate, which you just missed. It is already checkmate and we can actually oh. So there is a utilitarian mate, but let me show you guys, okay, so so bishop e3 check and let me think so, what's the simplest mo, of course the simplest is to play queen h4 and knight g3 check. Do you guys want me to do it? Do you guys want me to show you something really cool we're gonna. Do this? Let's yeah, and what is my idea I will. I will show you everything. What is no? Not queen h4, it's not going h4. What do you always need to check when you have a two move idea? What happens if I play the second move? First, boom goes the dynamite and after he takes queen g5 and checkmate is unstoppable. Now I didn't invent any of this. I've seen it before. I will explain everything now. I know that not everybody plays the king's indian and that's why the premise of the speed run is not to fixate on openings, because I'm respectful of the fact that people play different openings so I'll try to keep things relatively brief opening wise, but I highly recommend the king's indian anybody who's an attacking player. Okay. So, first of all, to recap: right: e5 e5 does not blunder the pawn, because if we take the pawn- or let's say this is the exchange variation, this is a viable line, but to take the pawn here is not a good idea because it allows knight takes c4. Exposing the attack on the knight takes and bishop takes e5 one very important detail. Why can try the desperado sacrifice? Knight takes f7 and if we take the knight white's gonna end up upon up? What can black do here to refute this? Who can who can tell me how black refutes this? Without this, the king's indian would not have existed, a c5 is viable, but that's the more benoni-like approach. Bishop c3 and king f7 nicely done guys. So that's the tactical reason. The king's indian works he goes d5. He defines the center immediately. This is called the petrossian variation after tiger and petrossian. The main line is to castle, and here actually, black has the additional option of taking on d4 rare line. But I like it- and we won't delve into this right now, but he goes d5, so a5 right, stopping b4. Then we get the knight to c5 and now by playing f3, he has cut contact with the h5 square. So in the king's indian generally there's three ways of preparing a 5 right. You can step away to e8 and then go f5 and then go back to f6. You can go to d7, although this is more rare, but this does have the benefit of supporting the knight. It does, however, block the bishop. Sometimes you can even go king h8 knight, ge kasparov patented. This idea, in numerous five gifts itself to the community, keeps that 3am hype going 4 a.m. Hype going! Thank you and umarus for five gifted two midnight rhino le sergei walrus, punk, pabs and j curse. Loving it loving and loving it, okay um, so we go knight h5, he goes. Bishop e3, b6 and a4 has a foco thanks for the tier one. Now, let's let me first explain why in like a grand master game, I would not have gone a4. So if we go f5 and he goes before, black is a very cool idea. Now, how do you gauge the success before you gauge the success of before? If the knight has to move somewhere like or black, then white's gonna get c5 in and this is successful. Could anybody tell me how black can respond to the move before in a very good way, and this actually is a typical king's indian idea? It's not f4 at force. You can just drop the bishop back I'll, give you a hint takes takes, and now what additional pretty maneuvered is black cowboo and that look at this beautiful juicy knight on d4. This actually helps black. So this is a very important subtle idea for kingzinian experts to know, but I played a4 to illustrate a concept now. First of all, why did we stop before because we cannot piss on him, but he immediately sees the pawn and takes it right. If he goes f4, then we will take it and now look at this beautiful bishop and look at this outpost on e5. This is generally what happens? Does that make sense, so he takes the pawn immediately and we play bishop h6, deploying the bishop and look at these dark squares all around white's king. That's the importance of squares. You know when you weaken a whole complex of squares like this you're gonna, be in big trouble, but should be three is basically an unstoppable threat if he tries to stop it with queen b3. What simple tactical motif does black have, and this basically transposes into the game. Yeah rook takes bishop e3, and if he covers it, we can go queen, h4, g3, oops, sorry, not queen g3, but knight g3 uh, and this is absolutely crushing. Okay, many top players of kings indian experts, including ikaro, he's played some brilliant games queen v3. So that's what would have happened there? He goes b4 unaware of what's about to befall him now, bishop e3, why is rook takes a4 necessary? We use the technique of thinking backwards to find rook takes a4. We begin by asking. Why can I not do this followed by queen she five threatening queen h6? Who can tell me what defensive resource white has it doesn't save the game? White will still be lost, but who can smell and sniff out how white prolongs the game? F4 is correct and bishop h5 and, of course, taking with the queen here, wouldn't be impossible. You could take on a4 now and win, but white's not going to take the rook. That's going to be obvious, but thinking backwards we say wait a second. If white's queen could be made to disappear from d1, then this would be checkmate because h5 would not be defended by the queen right um. So, oh, and by the way I see why I was unable to find games uh in in chess base. So, as you guys are thinking, I am going to make another search here to show you guys if I can find any um ideas here. Okay, I found a couple yeah, so we we therefore take on a4 first forcing the queen out and now we give a check. Of course, queen h4 would have been winning. In fact, it would not be trackmate immediately. He could try to go h3, but this would be a very straightforward mate in a couple moves right. Definitely don't trade, the dark square bishop. Now that doesn't mean you never do this, but you can see the danger of weakening a complex of squares. White should have gone knight, d3 here, but still knight, b39d4 and black is better. So against the averbach. I'm getting a question about a very specific line of the king's indian uh. Again, I'm gonna try not to stray too deeply into theoretical waters, but the upper back is where white develops the two bishops. First. What I do here is queen to e8 getting out of the pin preemptively so that I can play e5 and then, if d5, you can go knight, a6 knight, c5 kinda, like we did in the game. So let me now see if I can pull up a game where you will be able to see a very similar concept. Uh. Oh, I see already several possibilities now. Oh here's, a beautiful one here is a beautiful one, guys from a pretty high level game 2300. So what I'm showing you serious players are uh. You know they, so this is a king's indian game in which, literally all of the ideas we just applied were applied by this by by a pretty good player. So this is a game between two russian players: uh, pretty competent, you guys can see. 2192 was black. 2332 was white watch now, petrossian variation literally the same position. We had white played bishop g5. First, here's b6 right, I'm not making this stuff up. These are legitimate ideas and black actually provoked f3. Here's not h5 and hero black did something very interesting play. Bishop f6 preparing to to get the bishop to g5, weakening white stark squids white captured the pawn and black still played bishop g5 and hear white made the decisive mistake. Bishop takes f8, who can tell me what black did in this position boom boom and now boom? But here use careful guys. You have to apply the concepts in a smart way, because the move queen g, queen h4 there is knight f1 by the way queen h4 immediately here, there's knight, f1 and now all of a sudden white defends. So it's not queen g5, there's a better way of doing this and you always have to look for the executions that are suited to the position when you're applying a pattern, guys very, very important. Don't autopilot the execution of an idea all right, queen g5 knight f1, is a little bit less clear. Queen takes f8 knight, f1, queen h69c, and now black found the showstopper. What's the final move of the combination, this is a slightly more difficult position to execute this in verizon king g7, and once again you can go rook h8, but the beautiful mate is takes in rocket shape. Winning the game white's only way to stop this would be g4, but then just rook, hg and white resigned in this position. Oh here's! How a 2300 fell prey to precisely the sequence of moves, so you see this stuff is real. This stuff is applied and it's applied in games between pretty good players. Whoops speed, one all right: let's do one more! What what about king f1? Oh yeah, yeah, sorry uh, king! Ah, there was king f1. There was, I think, queen h4, that was a terrible game. Oh yeah, okay, let's do one more yeah white, certainly didn't play well by the way. Make no mistake why white did not have a good day. He shouldn't have taken the rook. That was a mistake. A 2300 uh shouldn't make, but they do I mean they make them. They make them too. Everybody's human yeah um, I'm on a roll. Today, careful let's go yeah. I know I know sir. Oh we're playing the same guy. We played last time who almost beat me? Okay, so let's play an accelerated, we're playing chess lebanese sal. I was at 2100 and almost beat me the last time. Okay, so we're going to take and play the accelerated and he's going to play the muratsi buying the best line that white has now here. Let me actually think about this for a second, what we're going to do we're going to play the move, we're going to play the move? D6, I'm going to show you guys a pretty cool system against the accelerated now. Normally black develops to g7 with the bishop, but I like a more rare system that I think is dangerous, but he actually finds the right way to skirt it. Bishop, b3 wow, this guy is the real deal. Oh, I should have got knight f6, actually, okay, whatever we'll just transpose them to the main line. I I I messed up the move order. We have to transpose into the main line um we have to transpose into the main line: okay, knight, f6, and I'm going to show you guys some of the key ideas of the accelerated dragon. I'm assuming that he doesn't know this that. Well now the marotzi bind in my opinion. If white wants to get an advantage against the accelerated, he should play the marotzi by that's, really the only very very testing system against the accelerated and uh. Let's see how well he knows the ideas now. How do we understand because this guy is underrated and really really good? I ask for you guys understanding I'm going to play a little bit faster and I'm going to play, maybe with a little bit less explaining than usual and then after the game I'll, be sure to compensate now right. Now we're just going to develop our bishop to d7. So far, we've just been developing our pieces. There's nothing to explain. Basically, black's idea is to play on the queen side and in order to play on the queen side, black will have to black will have to operate according to the following formula. First and foremost, you need to you need to grab space on the queen side, okay, but in order to grab space, we need to refocus our pieces a little bit, let's take on d4, and where do you guys think we'll put this bishop on d7? Where will we put this bishop on d7? We should put it on c6 all right, that's just a good, solid square and, when I say grab space on the queen side. What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is we'll need to play a5 a4 and that will allow us to put that clamp down on the queen side so that we can then deploy our queen to a5 and start attacking him. This is white is slightly better here. According to the computer, objectively white is better, no doubt about it. White's got more. Space, he's got the central control, but but in my experience this is hard to play. Uh accurately for a human being knight, t5 is good. Knight, t5 is a good move. Now, let me thank you for a moment, because I myself don't play the accelerated full-time, so this is. This is new to me as well. Okay, so we're going to take that night with a bishop and after the game, I will explain uh why I did that like fully, but but there is a reason behind it. Let me just write this down now: what pieces do we want to trade? His puns, his pawns are on the light squares. What do we want to trade if and I'll be more specific, which of the two bishops? Do we want white to give up? We want to give up the dark script. Bishop, because the light squared bishop is kind of lame right. A lot of the pawns are on the same color as his bishop. I don't put a lot of stock in that principle, but here it's a good idea to apply now. I I see you guys thinking well, wait. A second aren't. Isn't it weakening to give up our fiance bishop? Isn't that bad? Look! It's not great! That's a concession right, but there's not that many pieces left in the first place so uh. In my estimation, it's not like he'll be able to attack my king. Furthermore, okay goes f4. That's an interesting move and a very, I think, a very good one. He expands preemptively on the king side, so he will try to attack us on the king's side. Should we give up this bishop? Well, I have no choice. I kind of have to give up this bishop uh, otherwise. My whole strategy with 97. My whole campaign is just not that good and we have a decision to make. Do we trade queens queen b6? Unfortunately, conceptually this is good uh concretely, this is bad because if queen takes b6 knight takes b6 and the rook penetrates to cesar. So let's look at this knight for a second, it's stuck in no man's land. Where can we put it king's indian style with nazi fob girl and what move does this open the possibility of in terms of expanding on the queen side in terms of expanding on the queen side? What is now possible? We can play yeah, we can play a4, but um. We can play a4, but that's that's missing. Well, actually, yeah, we will play a4. We why? Why? First of all we're grabbing space? Second of all, what he wanted to do very sneaky guy that he is, is play a4 himself and cement that bishop that splinter in our throat at least the bishop, is now stuck, and it's not as well defended. How should we attack that bishop? How should we attack that bishop? We can play queen a5, but I like queen b6, which creates a standoff between the queens and I feel like I like the standoff, because I'm in control of it the piece. That's between two pieces, if it's protected by a pawn, that's a pretty specific principle, but I think it might be a good one if you have a standoff between two pieces and the piece in in the middle of it is your piece and it's protected by a pawn you're, usually in control of that standoff, which means I'm usually the one here who's going to decide whether and if to trade queens, which is a pretty powerful thing to do. Uh well before I can understand him. Okay, so let's improve our position. How can we do that? Could somebody name a simple, improving move, bringing a piece into the game: yeah rook, sierra okay? Here we have see this further supports the knight which I like, and I would have also considered playing a3 okay, so he goes king, a very good move, very good move, and now I want to continue expand. I'm gonna go queen b4. This is a very sneaky move um, because I want him to play a3. I want him to play a3, and why do I want it to play a3 because it weakens something? What does the move? A3 weaken. Could somebody answer me this question, while he's thinking the b3 square and I could potentially fork him on that square, so he goes e6. Okay, let me calculate for a second I'm just uh calculating a little bit here. There's some really cool cool lines. Oh, so what can we do here? What we can do is we can play the immediate move b5- and this is not that simple as it seems it seems like we're winning the bishop, because the bishop came over because of them. But what can he do? Dude dude? What can you do dude? What can he do and I'm gonna I'm gonna pre-move rook takes f7 check. What can we do if we move the queen, then what the hell did? We do this for so what's the tactic who sees it? I think we have a beautiful idea, knight b3 now, there's two things we're exploiting here. If he takes the knight I take his queen and if he takes my queen, I take his and look at the superiority that we now have uh our knight is guarding b5. We've got pressure on all at all angles. Here we play rook takes f7 once his bishop moves, we're gonna, take his rook, take the pawn on f4 and we're gonna have a winning end game so um, which which we'll have to win by playing. Precisely once again, I have to give big props to my opponent. He's really really good, but it seems like he's going down here, we're going to take the pawn and now we need to reassess the situation. How are we actually going to specifically win this position? Well, we're going to go after his queen side pawns, and with that in mind, where should we put the rook? Where should we put the rook, and this should come automatically to you guys, but now there's actually several ways to do it. Yeah rook f2 is correct, attacking the font forcing his rook to get passive and now we're just going to grind them down here we're going to grind them down now, one very important principle: I've shared with you guys many times in the past, never stop. Looking for tactics, no matter how many pieces are left on the word, one two and that's exactly what you guys are doing checkmate on h2. I think we actually played a super nice game. I'm curious to see what our what is. I don't usually do this, but I'm actually curious. I feel like I'm into this game and we're 2 000. yeah 88.3, not that good. You never know what your accuracy is. Sometimes you feel good great. You don't play well vice versa. Okay, let's analyze, I I don't think it likes the accelerated now. The line that I was going to actually play starts with knight f6. I was going to recommend this line where you get the queen to d4, so that when you fianchetto, you create the extra, but I'm not gonna talk about that right. Now we transitioned into the main line of the accelerator. Now, as you guys know, uh black is cramped right. That's the the main appeal of the marotzi is: is white clamps down on black center? Making me essentially move around on the first three ranks: that's not to everyone's liking, but I like these kinds of openings, so we take on d4 reposition the bishop and we start expanding on the queen side. Our idea is to go a5 a4 and then queen a5, and I actually think his move was a bit of a positional error and um. The reason why is that he's trading a lot of pieces and from a space advantage perspective? That's not the wisest thing to do, but it's also not the wisest thing to do, because he's going to leave himself with a pretty lame bishop. Now here's the thing in these positions. Can I ask you guys the following question: could a case be made for the move e takes d5 is: does this move contain any kind of sense and I'll tell you preemptively black is is doing well here, but I want to use this opportunity to make an instructive. What I think is a pretty instructive point. What is the case that could be made for this move? Yeah miso superior correct on you, the seven punt this week and there? Oh there's a classical game that is shown to all russian trained school boys. If you want a little sneak preview to the russian school of chess, this is shown to every little russian schoolboy and watch this. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to run through this game very very quickly. This is not a famous game. I don't think many of you know this game and I don't mean to be condescending, and I say that I just it's just not a very famous game unless you've been trained in the russian tradition but vinik against hola kevich bogmenick was 16. When this game was played, he had learned chess at 12., and while this is not an accelerated dragon, you get the same exact structure, look at the morozzi structure and guess what happens knight d5 knight takes d5 e takes d5, not c takes d5, but he takes d5. Now I want you guys to look at this and tell me what is the main difference between this position and e takes d5. In my, why didn't I say that black was fine in my game, but he's not fine here, because no knight the key is that there is no knight I'm asking not specifically and henry did yeah. So the key is that there is no knight in the c file. Well, the c file is closed. There too, the knight in such a position can take all these outposts and it can essentially slice off the artery to the e7 pawn, and that is the whole difference. Black. Has this lame dark squared light squared bishop and the result of this is that white just piles up on the e file? Look how classically he he does this now he pressures the queen city drives the pawn to b6 cements, it trades off the rook on the c file, blacks, only trump guard. Now he gets a rook of his own to the c file and he finishes the game with what very pretty idea. This ends the game and it's very fitting where this occurs, because that's the whole bottom line point of this strategy, queen e6 check, if you don't trade, queens white takes and promotes. If you do, d takes c6 and b7 and batman nick will promote his pawn upon, is actually unstoppable, nick against philip kievich, very famous game well to russian uh players, and you can see the idea very clearly defined here. Okay, now, you guys are all familiar with it and I'm actually very happy, I'm really pumped that you guys are now aware of this game. So let's compare that to this position. It seems very similar, but this knight could be either on e5 or on c5 uh, promoting the queen side pressure, and that makes all the difference. Okay. So at this level, when we, when we hit 2000 uh, it's all about making these subtle observations again, the method of comparison, comparing one position to another position. What is different that helps you understand and categorize imbalances, and that really builds your positional understanding. When you're able to look at a position and detect the key difference uh, then you get better at evaluating these kinds of positions. Okay, so he played c takes d5 we take on d4, but and again. If we go queen b6 here then uh. This would be a good trade, we're not for rook c7, very concrete, and he goes so knight, c5, bishop b5 a4 very important move. Otherwise he goes a4. Now we put play queen b6. We improve our position with rook c8. We pin the bishop with queen b4 by the way a3. My intention was to go knight b3 anyway and uh. The queen trade, as we kind of saw in the game, is beneficial for us. Now we could have locked everything up with that five first, that would have been sensible, but here I calculated some lines so had he taken first and gone a3, we still go knight b3, and this um. It does matter which rook goes to see it. How did I decide with casey, because rick fc8 would have abandoned the king and I'm not saying I would have paid the price for it, but something like f5 at some point could have been very scary. At least here I keep a little security detail on my king right. Does that make sense a little bit of a general answer, but hopefully that that's how I decided it now here? There's a couple of important details: if he moves his queen away, reinforcing the attack on my queen, there seems to be a pretty big problem. This is what I had to see. If I move my queen away, he takes the knight and he wins a pawn, but what key resource does black have here? What key resource does black have here? Um one sec, I'm writing down this. This uh, which rook yeah queen c5, is very important or queen d2s, uh and uh. This is fine, and I calculated this that lime doesn't end there. Bishop takes b5, but it's only here that black demonstrates the important resource rook to b8, attacking the bishop, winning b2. So without this move and that's what it boils down to why it would have been better so I calculated this, he made it easy for us by trading immediately and his position just collapses. We take take and now we're going to have three with a checkmate, isn't knight, d2, stronger uh, maybe not sure windy. Two is also good, so the the server is restarting uh. So I'll. Take this opportunity to talk briefly about a question that bothers a lot of people which is um any questions by the way which is which rook to put on a particular course. How do you decide? What is the decision? Logic that you can apply, um that you can apply in deciding which rook to put on a particular square? Now? Well, you don't! Coin flip exactly so there's a couple of things. The sort of baseline method that I well 2g6 allows queen takes d4, which is a separate line um. The baseline method that I um that I propose to apply is to think about when you decide which rook to put on a square, and you have a candidate move, you look at the other rook. You always look at the rook. That's left out from a square, and in doing so you try to assess whether that other rook will have any prospects, uh or not because oftentimes. So that's like method number one and then method number two. You always have to factor in future ideas, so method number one. You try to find a position for both rooks uh. You don't just myopic, you look at one. The second concept is you need to figure out what your long-term ideas are and long-term ideas can involve, keeping your king safe, as well as your opponents, long-term ideas, and sometimes it's very important for one rook to be in charge of being able to promote a long-term idea. Maybe that idea will occur. 15 moves down the line, but that could be a very viable reason to keep a rook on a particular square. So those two things I would say, uh formula, you know sort of form the main basis for deciding, but every situation is different and I don't want to oversimplify. This is a very uh. You know this is a very serious question. So, for example, let's do let's do some very, very quick practice in this just one one example. This is going to be kind of tricky, so bear with me, please yeah. So, let's, let's, let's apply this logic precisely here with one of my games from 2015 my worst tournament ever I dropped like 30 points, but I did win round one. So in this position my opponent plays queen takes queen jq and a ls thing for the prime, which rook should I recapture with rook a61 or rook after 81. Let's think about this, for a second and I'd like somebody to raise their head just kidding to make a case for which rook so I'm going to try to gauge the crowd here. Some of you think f, most of you think a let's play the um. You know what I'm going to play here beautiful time for this this this I'll, give you guys another 15 seconds all right. This is very fitting music all right. So the answer is rook a takes d1, and I want to make it clear that the difference here is marginal, but not everybody has detected the reason properly. The queens are off the board. So there's no reason to there's no reason to like think that black is going to ever attack. My king black is not going to attack my king uh most likely. So it's not that I need the rogue to defend the king, but I asked myself: where can I put this f rook and what I suspected would happen is that he would take the pawn on e5 and I would respond with bishop takes c5 but forecasting this uh into the future. I recognize that the e file might get opened and guess what it would be perfect to put this f rook on the e file. If I had taken with the f rook, then the other rook would have to choose between these closed files and I never really anticipated any one of them opening in the near future. So what happened? I played knight d5 here: boom boom boom. The file opens, and I didn't end up putting the rook on anyone. But that's that's completely beside the point. The point is I had this idea in mind and it it actually influenced his play and I won the game in the end. Okay, not the ideal example but uh, hopefully it it clarifies things for you guys a little bit exactly. Thank you. I can't wait for him to get older, so he slows down a little well. You know I'm trying to keep things swift, so it's entertaining but as I always say, if there's something that you don't understand specifically, I always encourage questions. If you'd like me to repeat something that doesn't mean you're dumb, it means you're invested in learning and I will never take it that way and nor should anyone else. That's the whole point of this in the first place, absolutely ryan! So are you asking what plan I'd have here or something specific go ahead? I always um disagreed with people who get annoyed when people repeat questions as long as it's not in a trolley way. Uh, because it just means people want to make sure they understand something. Yeah ryan, I'm I'm all ears. So let me well, I can use the opening, but I don't know what to do after that. Oh so, how do you plan in general? Is your question yeah, so one of the biggest misconceptions about planning is that when, like beginners think of grand masters, they think of gm's having these 15 20 move plans. These long, like major plans and that's actually incredibly talk storm with five gifted. Thank you. Storm really appreciate. That's a misconception. Mostly plans are two three four moves maximum and that's why I define the three move rule to say that any idea that takes longer three moves or longer is oftentimes going to be unrealistic, uh, because the position changes so fast in most cases at a grand master level that most plans consist of small maneuvers. I want to trade this one piece. I want to do this one small thing right: it's like running an errand you're, not planning for the rest of your life. There are exceptions to that. Sometimes the position can be completely closed, for example, and you can afford to make a 10-move plan, but those situations are definitely the exception rather than the role okay 43.75. I cannot believe it. It's unbelievable. Thank you, yeah! Thank you, cezar, ah, something like 50 14 1500. I don't play pull up like this. How do you determine whether it moves too passive, no formula, but you have to make a judgment call. Is it more important to defend your king or more important to just start attacking definitely ryan hundred percent they're 15 minute games, 30 minute games, minimum uh, not that many I'll answer questions since the server is resetting guys. Now is your chance to ask some questions. I don't memorize entire games, though. Thank you, phillipsburg. Well, I've done previous streams. Where I talk about openings and I'll do that sort of separately? Why was playing king h8 a good preamp to move well because it got the king out of the diagonal king h1 got the king out of the a7 g1 diagonal, so queen b6 wouldn't create discover, check ideas so in the same ish um- and this is the reason- the same ish um, it's 1am in california, but it's 4am in north carolina, which is the important part. So in the same ish you usually um castle queenside, which is what makes the same-ish quite unique among king's indian openings, usually in the king's indian white castle's king side in the sameish. In most cases, white actually does castle queen said and go for checkmate. So it's a very dangerous line.
