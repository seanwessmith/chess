[Music], okay m summa 14: let's go now: f3 is um okay, so he this is one of those people who does something crazy and hopes to intimidate you from yesterday. We know what we do. If people do this, what do we do in such a position? How do we actually play in such a position when our opponent tries to intimidate us with crappy moves we play? Normally we occupy the center with pawns and then we support that center with pieces. Okay, there's no other way to do it now. He goes knight f6. Now remember why you never play f3 one of the reasons that you never play: f3. Okay, let's play knight f6 to support the pawn of the knight. How do we actually? How do we actually try to? How do we actually try to exploit the fact that he's played f3? How do we try to explain how do we prevent it from castling in the long term? Where are we going to put them? Okay? First of all I go to c4, so he continues to push pawns and weaken his squares. We just drop the knight back, he's doing nothing but weakening his position, exactly bishop c5, to stop him from castling the long term. Okay, so, okay, h4 again, this guy is doing all sorts of random crap and we do not need to do anything to actually meet that. Okay, we can just play normally, let's just develop our pieces um, let's just develop our pieces and uh. I guarantee you guys that this is going to work a lot better than anything crazy. I don't like this pin. Okay, I don't like this pin. Can we do something about this pen? What can we do about this? Pin yeah h6 just chase the bishop. Now, if he takes and plays knight e4 we'll deal with that when he does it, I've seen that okay, he continues to play terribly. I mean look at okay, knight defender. This is where a lot of people be like. Oh no, you know he's put a knight on a good square. He has one piece on a good square. Big deal. We just dropped the queen back. We don't want to give c7 up and then we're going to get this knight out of d5 and he's going to be left with nothing but weaknesses. Okay, so let's see what he does, I mean this guy is really not playing very well. So really. The only thing to remember here is to continue developing naturally and not get intimidated by crap okay, so he wants to play b4 and chase our bishop away. Can we just piss him off by stopping b4? Can we be prophylactic here, even though that's completely unnecessary, but I want to show you guys how frustrating it is for people to have to deal with you constantly stonewalling their ideas. He reinforces the threat of b4. How do we stop before again? How do we stop before again yeah we go a4, you go. We go a4 because we want to meet bb4 with the on poisson. This is a very typical technique. That's used in a lot of different lines and obviously he still has gone before, but it's not the same. Now. How do we chase the knight away from d5, while also improving the positions of our pieces? There is a great way of doing that, while also improving the positions of our pieces. Simple simpson, amazing. We could go bishop e6, but perhaps we dropped this pawn. So what I'm gonna do is go knight to d4. Bishop e6 would also be good and then we're going to play c6 and chase the knight out of d5. If you think about it, the best way of chasing a piece out of a square squares with a pawn. If we chase a piece out of a square with a pawn, we virtually guarantee that that piece is not going to ever again move back onto that square and he's in huge trouble. Now we get to the actual process of winning he's got 93.. Now. What can we do in this position? We can continue developing with castles, but there's also free stuff that we can take, there's also free stuff that we can take and we can start taking that free stuff. Okay, but would we play rook takes a3, and how should we help him trade some pieces? Would we play rook, takes a3 and help him trade pieces? No, he will play bishop takes it here, because no, we are threatening to return to b4 and pin his rook to his king. Rook takes a3 would be fine as well. So, in addition to everything else, we are just going to win all of his pieces here. He basically has to move his king out, which is just a disaster. I mean this is this: is a hot mess yeah, but should be four. This is over. This is completely game. Over and uh he's got very few chances to survive. I think he continues to push response he's doing his best. Okay, a lot of people here would automatically grab the rook. We don't do that we spot for a second the flaw of this move, which is that it blunders the queen not only that he can't even take the knight back he's. Dropping everything here, he's dropping everything here. Okay, so we didn't do anything in this game. All we did was develop our pieces and um. Let me be very very clear: I am not trying to laugh at my opponent here. These guys are doing everything they can. They don't know that they're playing me, I'm sympathetic to that, so I'm not trying to make fun of anybody here. In fact, the reason I'm doing the speedrun is to help players like msume14 and I hope he's watching the stream. But if you are a player who likes offbeat openings, I would highly advise against stuff like this. Unless, unless um you have fully mastered an opening and when you're 16 1700- and you want to play some offbeat stuff- okay, that's a different story, but this kind of stuff it might intimidate players in your rating range, but you're not building sound fundamentals. I talked about this yesterday. You aren't building sound fundamentals that you can build off of later and you'll get stuck at a certain level. Okay, so first we control the center take. Now. How could we ensure that we control the center with pawns? Could we ensure that we control the center with pawns instead of going knight of six and recapturing the knight- and I like this- move that you guys are about to find okay, so the move d4? I want to talk a little bit about the move d4. This is a big mistake. This is a big big positional mistake. Why and a lot of people make this mistake. So listen up the correct move, hori plation is to play c6. That is correct. That's okay! That's why I'm here I'm here to help! You understand why this is a mistake. Morrigan! I love that you suggested this um and I want people to keep doing that. Okay, we learn by making mistake mistakes. The reason a move like d4 is a mistake is because it closes the center now you might be like how does it close the center? Well, it literally creates a little bit of a wedge that makes the center more close. And, more specifically, if you go bishop c5, the bishop is just going to now stare at the pawn. So you give him an easier time to castle remember when we keep the pawn on z5 we're able to put the bishop on c5 and basically prevent him from castling, okay. So by playing d4, you might argue, but wait a second daniel. Don't you cramp white's position right? Don't you get more space, you do, but space isn't everything in such a position. He can work around the pawn and get his pieces developed and, yes, he's going to be slightly worse, he's going to be cramped, but he would much rather be cramped and developed than not cramped and getting checkmated. So a closed center is not bad in general, but here's what I would say closed center positions are hard to play if you're a beginner, because they involve a lot of maneuvering slow play, but there's a lot of openings that are completely good openings, which involve a closed center. One example is the advanced french, which is good for both sides. The advanced french is an opening in which white closes the center voluntarily, it's one of the best weapons against the french, but it's a very hard opening to play for a beginner, because it involves knowledge of a lot of deep positional themes. Another opening which I play, which involves a close center, is the king's indian main line in the king's indian main line, which I'm just going to very quickly show you guys. White very often plays d5 closing the center and what happens when you have a closed center is oftentimes the situation, which is called attacks on opposite sides. When you have a closed center, you basically shake hands with your opponent and say: okay, we're not doing anything on this little sliver of the board. So I'm going to take this side of the board that I'm going to delineate and I'm going to delineate with arrows that are not orange in order to not confuse the people and for some reason, I'm not able to draw other errors. Whoa. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry guys you got the point white was attacking on the um black was attacking on the king's side, white was attacking on the queen side. My apologies for this um okay, so whatever um black is attacking here, white is attacking on the queen side and the question then becomes whose attack outweighs the other. For some reason, it's not letting me draw any other arrows. I don't know why, but it is what it is. You guys get the point um one moment, please, okay, so that's what happens when a sensor is closed and obviously, as you guys can understand, it's very difficult to manage, attacking on one side and defending on the other. So that's the reason why oftentimes, I recommend openings where the sensor is kept open so that you get more possibilities for tactics. I hope that makes sense. I'm explaining this in a very general level, there's a lot more specific stuff to to go into there, and I will now hear my opponent instead of trying to develop his pieces as best he can continues to push his funds and create very big weaknesses in the center and, of course we play bishop zepa. Where should white have put the bishop here, and this probably is white's last chance to get a halfway reasonable position, of course, he's much worse. Where should wider put the bishop and why, if you guys have been morrigan, that's freaking right, you get him girl. Bishop b3 is correct to stop bishop c5. Okay, you want to develop in order to stop your opponent from developing his pieces on good squares. That is a very high level way of developing. When you're developing your pieces, you not only want to think about the most active squares for your pieces. Bishop g5 technically is the most active square for white's bishop, but there is a greater priority here, which is to stop black's bishop from coming out onto c5 and controlling this diagonal, and after this he goes h4. He exacerbates the situation we get rid of the pin. Okay had he gone 94. If we wanted to preserve the bishop, what would we have done? We can go queen e7, and this is fine, but if we wanted to preserve the bishop, what would have also been possible here? Yes, bishop before check is good, um and and then we can move the queen and and then we can slide the bishop back to c5. Later on after we get rid of the knight okay um. So so here, rook b1a5 is a prophylactic move to stop b4. We didn't need to do this. We could have just developed, we could have gone. Bishop e6 and b4 is not scary, but I wanted to show the principle of prophylaxis. I wanted to show how effective it is in certain positions to prevent your opponent from doing what he wants to do on poissons. Obviously, this doesn't get the same effect. In fact, it just weakens his pawn and gets things worse. We get rid of the knight we take the pawn. We pin the rook, we take the queen, we win the game, so in fact, really the trouble started when we stopped him from playing b4 people are very stubborn about their ideas, so when you actually take the time to prevent people from doing what they want to do and this hap, this is true all the way up to the grandmaster level. It's very very disconcerting. That's why players such as tigran, petrossian and anatoly karpov were so good at chess, because not only were they good in all areas, but they also went out of their way to prevent the opponent from making things happen. It is a medical term, that's where it comes from um amrad summer says why not b6 instead of a4 uh well, b6 doesn't actually stop before. Maybe it it defines it a little bit, but it doesn't actually stop white from playing b4. I struggle with moves like a4. I just never know what to play. Well, I mean you play it now. Here's the thing I want to make very clear before we move on to the next game. Yeah nimisevich was basically the father of prophylactic thinking and he lives in the first half of the 20th century. You you don't want to stop every single threat right, for example, in a position like this. I would not say: oh white wants to push his pawn to h5 and I'm going to go h5. You can take prophylactic thinking way too far and a lot of beginners actually do that they're, afraid of ghost threats, they're afraid of things happening that aren't actually going to happen or even if they are or not dangerous. That's one of the hard things about prophylactic thinking. Is you don't know? When is a threat significant enough that you need to stop it, and I can't give you guys a one sentence method to determine that that comes with experience and it comes with getting better at evaluating danger, which is something that we're going to talk about progressively as we get onto a higher level. Okay. But hopefully this game is a worthwhile introduction to prophylactic thinking when it actually works um. So I'm going to write this down queen d4, he could have stopped the matrix okay, we're playing at 800., that's actually, the first time we are playing in 800, so let's uh focus, and hopefully this game is going to go well. He goes e3 again one of those moves where we just respond by occupying the center. This is kind of a reverse french. I think it's called van I'll take questions after this game. Okay, knight, c3. So again he does random stuff and we're just going to occupy the center. The queen is defending the pawn it's okay, it's my pleasure to do this, but I always appreciate support subs. Everything is always appreciated, never expected! Please don't feel guilty for just being a helpful viewer. That is also very much appreciated, but I do obviously um greatly, I'm very very grateful for all of the support as well. Okay, so he goes d4 now charm. I think for the prime now this is a good example of playing with a close center. I am going to close the center and I'm going to show you guys how to play with a closed center. I'm going to give you guys an introduction to playing with a closed center. Now he gives us a check which is actually a completely empty check which allows us to actually support our center. How can we block this check? How can we block this check and simultaneously give some support to the center yeah c6 and we're getting get out of there get out of there and we get a nice little pawn chain? That's basically giving us a small advantage. Now, let's continue developing, let's first develop this bishop. Where do you guys think we should put this bishop? Thank you, kimble s and bits. Where should we put this bishop um d6 is right. So a lot of people want to put it on b4 um, and I will explain after the game why bishop b4 is bad or it's not bad, but it's not great. He goes bishop g4 and what he wants is that if we take the bishop he gets his queen out and that queen is going to attack g7. Do we need to take his bishop a lot of people suggesting f5 which sends the bishop back? That is a fantastic move get out of g4. We could have also simply developed our knight to f6 and made him take our bishop he's, giving us a check. It's not doing anything other than helping us develop a very nice pawn chain. Now, let's continue developing, how do we continue developing nothing, no rocket science here we just continue. Developing we've got a nice pawn pyramid. Let's continue developing with knight, f6 knight, h3 we're going to castle. Okay, nothing, no rocket cycle, knight, g5, again he's making moves that aim to intimidate us, but they actually do absolutely nothing. How do we get this knight out of here? Let's go h6 and get that knight? Oh my god. Okay, so he blunders his knight he's his mistake. Is that he's not actually developing he's just moving the same piece over and over again? That's not okay. Now he offers us to open the center. Should we open the center? Yes or no? Are we ready to open up the center now that we are up a piece? We absolutely are, ladies and gentlemen, we absolutely are because we have not only an extra piece and, as you guys know, one of the fundamental principles of operating with extra material is that you want the centers to be open for that material to show itself. The second thing is that we have most of our pieces developed and his pieces are super passive. He takes with a bishop by taking with the bishop, he leaves the e4 square extremely weak. So let's put a knight there. What other move? Do we prepare by playing knight e4 and what pawn do we take with? What pawn do we actually take with, and this is very important guys we take with the f pawn to stop him from castling? Yes, beautiful, we take with the f1 to stop him from guessing now the king, only one is gonna hunt it down. Let's go after him. How? What does that mean? How do we go after him? How do we go after him um we, we can trade, the rooks. That would be fine, but there is a far better and far more effective, which is screenage, spread out very good check if he goes g3 to cover the check. We are just gonna. Take that pawn on h2, but we're gonna do that. Only after a preliminary move, we're gonna see, let's see what he does, he should actually move his king out and try to escape he's completely lost here and after king d2, I'm gonna make a very instructive move. Okay. So what move should we play before taking the pawn in order to draw his king closer to the center of action? Let us first take the rook we're not doing that to trade, we're doing that. To get us king a little bit closer to the king side and now we're going to take the pawn on h2. What is our next move going to be? How are we going to actually deliver? The checkmate nerd nation is suggesting a beautiful idea. We know, according to one of our key principles, that in situations when we're close to checkmating our opponent, one thing that people often forget is to involve all of the pieces in this case. Look at this rook on a. Where does that rook belong? Okay, we don't actually need the rook here. We have enough pieces to finish them off. Where is the mate? I want people to find the mating sequence. It's made of two and in fact, there's many ways. The rook is sad because it doesn't participate, but we don't need it to participate. We take it's not mate. He goes king f1. Where is the mate? I want people to give me two possibilities for checkmate. What are two checkmating moves? Queen f2 is one and what's the other, I'm going to make the other move, because it's very elegant come on guys. What's the other one? Bishop h3 is beautiful, mate game over okay. So, let's deconstruct what happened in this game, this is our introduction to playing with the close center. The center didn't say close for long now. The funny thing is, it would actually have been hard to keep the center open because had we played knight c6 in order to defend the pawn. What would be the problem with the move, knight c6? What would be the problem with this move? What would be the problem with this one? This is kind of like a reversed french, with an extra tempo for y yeah d takes c, and if we take there are more attackers on d5 than there are defenders and so knight takes d5 drops the central pawn. There's no need for for us to allow this and uh, and so for that reason, um, and so for that reason we have to decide what to do. We can take on e4, but we decided to go e4, okay, so for the high rateds among you- and I know you guys are very patiently watching- and I know not, everything is interesting. A relatively high level piece of advice, one of the key concepts when you have a closed center- is to attack essentially the base of the pawn chain. Aaron nimsovich. That guy I mentioned. Remember that name aaron nemesevich, because I'm gonna be mentioning that name pretty often he's a pretty important character. He was also an in real life, but the guy really developed a lot of chess theory and knowledge. Keep that name in mind. Aaron namsovich, aaron nimzovich, in addition to advocating for prophylaxis, talked about the concept of attacking the base of the punching. What does the base of the pawn chain mean? Well, if you have a pawn chain, is the base e4 or is the base d5? He does die on the end, but before he dies he develops a lot of chest thinking the base is obviously d5. E4 is called the tip by attacking the base of the pawn chain. It's like removing it's the same philosophy as removing the jenga block at the bottom of the structure. Before the whole thing topples right. We don't remove the top of the block if we want it to topple, we remove the bottom okay. So it's the same thing. The tip will collapse if the base is attacked. So what in white's position from that perspective, has been a mistake? What move should he not have made and why shouldn't he have made it? What move would he like to take back? Bingo white wants a damn pawn on c4, and so a move like knight b1 would actually be possible. Now, let's go back to the french, which I mentioned in the french advance, and I claim that you guys can now find black's best move without knowing anything about the theory of this opening. What is black's best move in this position? C5 is correct. Beautiful and after c3 white defends, sometimes black actually tries to go b5 b4, okay, literally attacking the base of the pawn chain. I know that b2 is the base, but this is a little bit too slow. So the further down the pawn chain you go, the more pawns are liable to collapse. This is called undermining. This technique is called undermining and in the french, what what black tries to do often times is to attack the pawn on d4. That's why we do knight c6 and queen b6 and caracon is very similar. I can show you plenty of games that have been won by attacking the base of the pawn chain. I can show you some of my own games. Okay, so that's a very important positional concept. It sounds very complicated, but I think you guys should all understand the philosophy behind it. So that is why closing the center is favorable for us in this case, because our pawn chain is very nicely protected. In fact, by playing bishop b5, he actually helps us build an even stronger pawn chain, so he's helping us do our bidding. You can also attack the tip of the pawn chain. That's a that's a legitimate strategy. You can do this as well to try to get some air space for the bishop. Okay, so continuing he's just shuffling his bishop around and look at the spawn on e4, it's making it very difficult for the night to come out. It's also making it very difficult for the knight to come out here, because we're just going to take the knight and ruin the structure somebody is asking when he played bishop. What about bishop dc? The problem with bishop d7 would be that after bishop takes d7, we would have to take with a queen to keep the spawn protected. So bishop d7 isn't so much bad as c6 is good, and I want you guys to understand that there are certain positions where a lot of moves are fine, but one of the moves is more conducive to the general goals in your position. So after bishop's do bishop d6 he's just shuffling his bishop around we're sending that bishop away, we could have also played knight, f6 and uh by we're. Basically what my friend dana mckenzie calls moving our opponent's pieces white has just moved his bishop 15 times and done absolutely nothing. We have already developed a bunch of our pieces. So what should whites blacks? Why should white's plan be here? He shouldn't trade, the light squared bishops. He should actually try to trade, the dark squared bishops and for the higher rated guys among you. What is a plan to try to to try to exchange the dark square bishops? What can white try to do and believe it or not? This is a very typical plan in the french. This is a very typical plan in the french, with colors reversed. How does white try to get rid of this terrible french bishop bingo b3 a4, bishop a3? If you guys look at french games, you actually often times see precisely this plan being applied with caller's reverse: it's not rocket science you're trying to get rid of your worst piece and you're developing a plan to try to get rid of that piece. In fact, let me show you guys an example of that, just just to show you guys that I'm not lying. All of this can be observed in the french, which is the closest opening to this pawn structure. Here we go. Here's an example of how, when I did this here is an example of when I did exactly this thing: 10 bucks from lapin dorito. Thank you. So much of course, I appreciate it very sweet would not be possible without your guys support here. You go literally word of her word here. We go my game against jean-marc de grave. I did play the french a couple of times in my chess career. This game is from 2016, I'm playing a french grandmaster. It is black to move. I want everybody in the chat to tell me the next three moves that I played with black because they are identical to what we just talked about just with colors reversed. What are the next three moves? I play b6. Okay. I want at least several people because it is lit morgan. You are amazing. Everybody is amazing, b6 queenie, two to stop bishop a6, a5, bishop, basics, okay, and so I traded the bishops, and that was good for me and I got a nice position in the end. The game ended in a draw because it was very complicated, but I managed to trade off the lights for bishops. So again, we continue to see that at the grand master level, a lot of these plans are actually completely understandable. But if you were to look at these moves without this entire introduction, you might think oh grand master pawn move so mysterious. In reality, it's not mysterious at all. I'm just trying to trade off my worst place, piece, which is a very typical idea in the french, okay um. So sorry for the detour just wanted to show this to you guys. So you know what what is behind this idea um and here he should have considered doing the similar thing. Now we just developed. He should have castled here and kept developing in his own right and then one of our plans here would have been to attack on the king's side. How do we attack on the king's side? Well, one good way to attack with a center being closed is a pawn storm. How do we orchestrate a pawn storm? We want to play g5 and f4, but we cannot play g5 because the knight is guarding that square. How do we prepare g5? Thank you heard that with a twitch prime, how do we prepare g5 and just give me a second guys? I need to send a message in the meantime, keep thinking. Okay, h6 is correct, h65 and f4. Now h6, let's make some empty moves right. You cannot play f4, but maybe you could you actually can play a four. You can consider it because after e takes f4 and I will introduce now the concept of an intermediate move or, as they say in italian intermezzo or in german exhibitions, an intermediate move is a move that is made before another move to prepare that other move. So what can you do now? What can you do now? Bishop takes h3 now white has f, takes g5, which is why this gets complicated. But let's simplify this by saying white takes morrigan asks a an amazing question and as this nighthawk at our level, are you concerned that we push the pawns in front of our castle. King fantastic question bear with me for a second here guys. Obviously, as I have said before, you guys know the principle do not push pawns in front of your castle, king, and that is most of the time true, but this is where I start to talk about violating strategically violating principles which you need to learn how to do in order to get better. Why is it actually justified here? Well, the reason there's two reasons: there's a push and a pull effect. First of all, look at the king side does white have any pieces on the king's side other than his king. No, he doesn't right. He doesn't and it's very hard for him to get his queen somewhere to g4 h4, because his bishop is blocking the queen. So that's number one number two: even if white tries to get pieces onto the king's side, it will be way too slow, because what black is already threatening f3? Where is this bishop going? Where is this bishop going nowhere it's trapped, so black is so fast here that white's king weakness is a lot more significant than black's king's weakness. Black has more possibilities on the king side. Okay, I'm trying to find an analogy here: okay, queen d7 and queen takes h3 all right. It's like a lottery ticket drops from the sky, and you know that you're gonna win the lottery, whoever it's like a hunger games scenario right outside of my window on the road. I see a lottery ticket and um, I'm here and usain bolt is equidistant from that lottery ticket, so we're racing who's going to win who's. Saying bolts are me obviously usain bolt right, we're usain, bolts and white is like me and we're thinking and the lottery ticket is the king side. Attack black is obviously so much faster here. So that's the judgment call that you have to make but daniel. How do I learn how to make that judgment call? Well, you just saw the logic and it's difficult. I want to be clear that these judgment calls are precisely what define chess mastery it's difficult to make them you can make misjudgments. I can show you plenty of games where I opened up the king side, mistakenly thinking that my opponent had no attack and it turned out that I was wrong. That's just chess okay! So that's how to think about it, not to be too long-winded here, but instead he just I mean had he gone back to h3, he would have actually helped us start attacking and instead he blunders the knight- and here we open up the center. Another complicated thing about the center being closed is that you always have to think about who benefits in the case of the center getting opened here. We are up a piece and we have much better development. So we are the ones who benefit uh, because obviously center getting opened helps us attack faster, okay, any questions about this game before we get to the next one. Any questions about this game before we get on to the next one exo521 asks why trade dark and not light squared bishops. Well, look at this light. Squared bishop look at it. It's terrible! It's staring at the pawn, it's not doing anything and it has no prospects. It can just go to the miserable d2 square. Now the light squared bishop, at least it's controlling some squares. At least it's controlling some squares. It's not great, but it's doing something the bishop is just permanently consigned to the dungeon. Thank you, dr lambo, for the twitch prime. How do you deal with lots of pawn moves in the opening? Well, as I explained, one of the crucial things is to adhere to basic opening principles. You want to keep developing, even if your opponent is just moving pawns around okay, um, that's basically the fundamental thing you want to abide by, but you also want to look for tactics, so you don't just want to close your eyes and develop. You also want to see if your opponent isn't blundering anything okay, um. I I feel that I understand that morgan is taking, but but yeah, that's that's actually a classic thing and I feel the same way when I watch carlson explain his move. Oh, I can play like magnus, but then I play and I feel dumb um. How do you know which bishop is better? Well again, guys, I'm not using anything that you guys aren't seeing I'm literally looking at how many squares a piece is controlling and whether it has the possibility of eventually developing to a good square um. Now it is also important to realize- and I'm going to make a small detour before the next game, that there are cases when you have a piece which looks terrible and that piece looks so bad you're like man. That piece is never going to be good again, but you want to always entertain the possibility that a piece will, one day far in the future in 2025 open up, and sometimes you have a piece that is currently terrible. But if it opens up will be the ultimate beast and will win you the game. Okay- and sometimes this is one of the beautiful things about chess. You want to think in the long run and you actually want to keep a piece on a square where it looks really bad with the knowledge that one day that piece is going to get opened up and it's going to decide the game in your favor. That's also a difficult judgment to make daniel. Do you have a game to show me what the hell you mean I do here is one of my games from 2008 to show you guys what I mean by that okay. So let me fast forward to the critical moments of this game. Okay, so this is a game. Sorry, this was not san francisco. This was actually reno. I don't know why it's a san francisco um reno, okay, so this was in re. Oh sorry, this was yeah. This was in reno um and take a look at my position. I have what is my worst place piece. What is my worst place piece? What piece looks awful? What piece looks awful yeah look at this look at this piece of crap. Look at this piece of crap, okay. Now, but let's take a look at a scenario. Let's imagine imagine for a moment. Imagine for a moment that the pawn was gone from e4. Imagine that it could magically make the pawn disappear for so, for example, let's say plus f5, which is terrible and I play do you guys see how amazing this bishop is? It just it x-rays, it skewers black's entire position. This becomes the ultimate beast. I am white guys. The the player listed first is white, okay and we're all we're going to be facing the side that I'm showing the instructive elements for it's not always going to be me. Sometimes it's going to be my opponent, so I judged in this moment that I should probably keep the bishop on g2 and not try to improve it and put it on h3, for example, because I thought that maybe one day this bishop gets opened up and that it's gonna be the beast, but look at what happens we play we play here. I found a really nice tactic. Rook takes f7. He cannot take the rook, I'm not gonna delve too deeply into this, because that's not the point, but basically he has to give his queen up for two rooks queen g5 queen takes c5 queen takes d4 and guess what move I play now guess what move I played now and I know I'm going fast- I'm just trying to illustrate the ultimate concept. Sorry and look at this look at this monster. Look at this monster compare this position to this position huh. Now it's the beast! That wins the game and it delivers the penultimate check. It is the piece that powers white's mating attack. He cannot take back onto b7 because guess what peace supports the queen on mary- and I thank you annika for gifting to morrigan. It is the bishop, so sometimes there are exceptions to the rule. Sometimes you want to keep a piece on a particular square um where it one day is going to be very good, but I can also show you the flip side of this. Sometimes a piece is just miserable and sad for the rest of the game and you can even give up material to make a piece like this happen. One of the saddest games in my ex in my life was my game against alexander ownership from the 2015 us championship. Where I had a bishop on aaa. Look at my bishop on eight I'm playing black. This was this actually was famous anish geary after this game tweeted. I wish I something like I wish. I was in naredinski today, um, that's what he said because of my bishop on eight, this bishop is never gonna get out, it's actually a hilarious situation. They could jam jam five gifts itself. There we go it's a hilarious bishop on a8, which is never going to get out, and even though I am up a pawn black is completely lost because I am basically down a piece. I resigned the game up upon because he just gets in with his king and he takes all of my pawns okay, because my bishop is never gonna get out. So that also happens. There's two sides of the coin. Okay, that is actually a very sad situation, so I'm actually not going to concentrate on it any further. Let's go back to the speedrun and let us begin the next game. [Music]. You.
