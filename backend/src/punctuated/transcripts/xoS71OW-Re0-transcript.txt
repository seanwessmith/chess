[Music] jack 75: let's go e4 and uh again we see a philidor which we've seen a lot and we know that the move is d4 opening up the center. At this point, I will not spend a long time on the opening. You guys know the drill we're just developing pieces. Naturally- and we do know those of you who are attentive to previous streams. Castling here is inaccurate. Does somebody know why, and can somebody tell me how we avoid this particular type of trap? Why is castling a very natural move? Not that good, because of knight takes e4 knight, takes c4 and then d5 exactly so. How do we avoid that? Where do we tuck one of our pieces away so that this isn't a thing what's up? Tommy h3 doesn't actually do anything against the idea of knight takes c4, we go bishop to b3, we talk the bishop away. This is a very typical move in many types of positions, and now we can very safely castle. Now it is true that he can okay, he doesn't do it. He puts his knight on e5. That is a bit of a weird move, because what can we do with this knight and uh in a manner conducive to our general kingside ideas, which is to start the attack? Let's go f4 chase the night away. The knight can go to many different places. He can go back to d7, which is what he does, and now we have to decide how we are going to continue the attack. There's many ways of doing it. There's many good moves here. I think, but one idea that comes to my mind is to prepare, perhaps the pawn break e5 trying to open up the center. We can't do that immediately and I want you guys to be very patient here, because if we play e5 immediately, we will lose the pawn. I also don't want to go rookie one and the reason I don't want to go rookie one is because when we go e5, if and when and he takes and we take, I want this rook to be on f1, because it will be uniquely poised to exploit the opening of the f-file. So this is forward thinking. We want to keep the rook here in anticipation of the if the file getting opened. So this is a pretty big balls task. We can go queen e2, but we know from our principle that we shouldn't assign a task to a piece of higher value when we can assign it to a piece of lower value and that piece of lower value is the knight. This is a retreating move, but it's a very strong retreating move, because we are preparing something very aggressive, but let's not go e5 immediately. Let's not go e5. Yet if we go e5 immediately, we allow the queen trade so first we're going to get the queen to e1. This kills two birds with one stone. First of all, prepare c5. Second of all, we prepared to bring our queen onto a very strong attacking post, and now we can go e5 adam. Thank you for the prime appreciate it. You can see how methodically we're playing here. Okay, what do we do? How do we proceed in this position? And actually, I'm asking you guys a pretty simple question pretty trick question because you might be looking for something extraordinary, but I always remind people never to forget about your development. We have not completed our development. We have an entire side of the board that is not developed. Thank you, queen g3 blunders, the queen. We just develop our pieces now. Yes, we give up our bishop, that's painful, because the bishop is skewering the diagonal, but that is okay. No mission way. May thank you for the prime. Why is that? Okay, because his pieces are all over the board, his knight is in the corner and now he's gonna get blown out of the gym here. He doesn't even decide to take my bishop. What do we do now? How do we continue? Tightening the screw as we go knight? T5, very good. You know work centralizing the knight we are not attacking the pawn, but we are centralizing the knight the knight is controlling many squares. We could have also gone h3 to get rid of this very annoying pin. I should have gone h. That was, that was a better move. Knight d5 was a little bit impulsive, but that's okay, because black is so passive here we can afford to even go back to c3 if we want to if we wanted, which is what we're going to do, and I want to show people that it's okay to admit your mistakes in chess, and I guess in life too, although we don't like to do that very much anymore. Okay, now, let's go h3 to get rid of this pin. I told you guys a principal principle yesterday that helps you assess whether pins are dangerous. Does somebody remember what this principle is? Okay, what do we do now? Sorry, I'm getting I found peter gionatos is distracting me, okay, um. What do we do now? How do we continue? Well, what do we need to look for here? What we need to look at is the knight on h5. We need to make the judgment that our pieces are so well placed that we can now proceed to basically the kick-ass phase and the knight on h5 is in the corner and it is trapped. We just win the night. Uh-Huh are you? Are you here? How do we know if the pin is dangerous? Sorry, so, if a pinned piece is defended by a pawn, then the pin is then the pin tends to be a little bit less dangerous. If the pinned piece is not defended by a pawn, then normally the pin should be considered quite dangerous. That's not a hard fast rule, but it's a good shorthand for assessing whether you need to deal with a pin immediately, because the bishop is pinning the knight, but okay, f5 is well that's a terrible move because he blunders another knight. Now a lot of people here would make the knee-jerk response and take the knight on h5. But let's spend a second looking for a better move. If you notice the move, f5 has opened up the diagonal for the bishop. The knight on e6 is protected only by the queen and the queen is overloaded. Why is it overloaded? What can we do in order to get this queen out of e8 such that it will not no longer defend the knight on e6 come on guys give me the move. Rook takes the a bingo taking one knight and then taking the other in succession, we're going to be up two pieces and the game is going to be over simple and strong, simple and strong and keep cameras on 14 for the prime. Let's keep the hype going, I'm loving it. Okay! So we're up two pieces negative 1456. He gives us more stuff, but we got to be a little bit careful here. I think we can just take this guy. I mean he's probably intending queen d4 check, thinking that he forks us, okay. Well, that's just an empty check. We can move our king up and uh. Thank you deck jumper! Now, how do we win a position like this? We win it by by centralizing our pieces and essentially going after his king. We don't need to trade. Anything. One way that I immediately am thinking about. Of going after his king is to build a battery against the h7 square. Building a battery is is sort of one of the key attacking principles in any position, but here in particular, because he doesn't have a light squared bishop. This battery is going to be essentially unstoppable, he's actually helping us build it uh. By sending the bishop over to d3. I would have gone there anyway, and our next move is going to be queen e4 with humongous threats against h7 1994 is possible as well. These positions are so winning that we can basically do anything. We want and win it. Okay he's moving my pieces yep exactly queen h, queen e4, threatening checkmate he's, got to play g6 in order to prevent it, which is incredibly exposing. Then we're going to move our knight and follow follow that with with uh hg6, he can take our pawn, but then again he exposes the attack on the h7 square. Thank you. Barry mccockinner for gifting to jay hubes, loving the support right now, what's typically more powerful, rooker bishop. Well, the queen bishop battery is my personal favorite. As we get the rook to an open file, newly created okay, rook g8, we're gonna, take and now we're gonna go we're gonna go knight, g3, bringing the knight into the attack he's threatening h4. Let's win a third piece with a fork, there's so many ways of winning this position that I'm not even really commenting on the way that I choose now we're gonna get. I don't even care about the night, we're up so many pieces that whatever I'm just gonna, get the queen of six, I'm gonna, whatever just bishop h6 here forcing the queen trade, which actually also helps me, create a pass pawn, which I will promote with checkmate, because this game is boxed in all right, good game, um very quickly and I'm gonna do one or two then maybe switch back to blitz. Essentially, he should have taken the bishop. I mean this bishop actually won us the game. He should have taken the bishop, but here we play a takes: b3 get the rook to d1 and uh. Eventually we're going to chase this bishop away from g4. That's why they say, knights on the rim are grim now. Sometimes nights on the rim are good if they're accomplishing something specific. But here one good way to think about knights on the rim is whether they have an evacuation route going forward, and here the knight from h5 does not have an evacuation round. It is trapped. It is very dangerous to have a piece like this, which has no, which a is is on the side of the board, where it can be attacked and b, has no evacuation path. Why not queen h4? Instead, I assume of g4, so queen h4 would have been possible as well yeah. This would have. I was a little bit concerned that he would take the knight on c3, though, and now we run into a little bit of trouble, because our rook on d1 loses its defender. We have to play rook take state, and now he takes with the queen. Now remember. He is currently up a piece because he's captured our knight. We cannot take two pieces at the same time and our queen is hanging. We've got too many things to deal with here. We have to take one of the pieces either take the queen and then take the bishop, and then he can get an evacuation route for his night or we take the knight, but we are no longer up a piece. He moves his bishop away and he's fine. So the reason I rejected queen h4 is because I was a little bit worried that the rook on d1 would be poorly protected uh, seeing that the bishop can capture the knight. I didn't calculate this, but it was an intuitive judgment, film, okay, um, so instead of playing f5, he should have just given up one piece, but he decided to give up two I mean that's often what happens uh when people panic and uh that basically was the whole game. I mean I didn't really do anything specific. I think the important moment was here. I mean I'm not claiming that white is even better here, but I'm trying to illustrate a concept which is that when you come up with an idea, you want to find the best way to execute that idea and the higher rated you get the more complex the executions become here. A lot of people want to go rookie one, but to remind everybody. The rook on f1 is uniquely poised to exploit that f-file once it opens. So, not only do you want to position pieces on good squares and, in a sense, in a sense using our terminology, the rook has a lot of potential energy. It has very, very low, kinetic energy because it's staring at a pawn it's on its almost on its initial square, but it has tremendous potential if the f-file opens and that's what makes it hard to appreciate this rook's, this rick's power. Okay, any questions before I go on if queenie ii well queen e2. Another drawback is that in such a situation, the knight on d4 loses its protector. So the reason I wanted to keep the queen on d1 for the time being, is that when I play e5, I anticipated the d-file opening and when the d-file opens, the knight on d4 might be caught on the crossfire, and it would be nice if the queen remained there to defend the knight. Let's continue: okay, lexman 18, let's go e4 and let's play either the italian or the roy lopez. Okay, he goes d5 the elephant, gambit we've faced it many times on sound, but not as bad as people make it out to be. We will take on d5 now the normal continuation here is e4 yep, so this guy actually knows what he's doing, and if I, if my memory serves me correct, then we actually do not move the knight here. Can somebody tell me what possible move we have that doesn't involve moving the knight? How do we? What is the alternative way yup queen e2, and this pawn is going to be picked off because he doesn't have any pieces out to defend the spawn? What do we do? How do we get to this pawn on e4 now that it's defended by f5? We don't have much time to waste. We need to operate quickly, so we go d3, we go d3. Now we continue to attack this pawn. We can take once, but there's no need to do that just yet. So what should we do? And this is actually a very interesting moment, so we could go knight g5, but I would prefer to develop while we attack the pawn. So let's go knight to c3 and now, let's take the pawn on e4 once, let's see what he recaptures with he plays bishop takes c3 to take away. This makes a lot of sense to take away the attacker of the e4 pawn, but here's the thing remember that we're upon up from a previous marriage we are upon up still and even if we don't get to this pawn, that's fine. As long as we can protect the pawn on d5, can we protect the pawn on d5? Can we protect the pawn on d5 yeah, so c4 is possible, but I want to look for something better, because here is my fear. With the move c4, if we play c4 and he castles, we are uncastled and not only are we on castle, but the queen on e2 is blocking our bishop from developing. So I would anticipate some trouble, tactically speaking, if he gets this big lead in development. Now this refocuses our priorities and our priority becomes not saving the pawn but actually stopping him from castling. If we can stop him from castling, we equalize the playing field, not only that we have two bishops that can be very useful in an open board. Can we stop him from castling? Yes, we can bishop a3, the move, queen b5 is very tempting, but, as I've reminded people always remember that checks can be blocked. When you give a check, you shouldn't assume that the king has to move move. Bishop a3 prevents him from castling by taking under control the f8 square. Now the queen has come out to d5, which immediately signals to us that we can deploy some of our pieces with tempo while attacking the queen now, which piece in particular do I have my eye on and how do we deploy it? Indeed, rook d1 and we can see that his king is in big trouble. It might not seem that way right now, but it is he attacks our bishop. He attacks our pawn. Can we defend both at the same time? Yes, we can bishop b4. Obviously we give up a2, but as people should be realizing by now, our priority isn't pawns. Our priority is to go for checkmate and uh. If that requires okay, he doesn't take the pawn now. He actually is also playing quite quite well, but I think we can. We can make this happen now we want to get the c4 pawn if we get the c4 pawn, then that that constitutes an immediate avenue toward his king. How do we go after this e4? Pawn is the key question we have to ask ourselves and the answer presents itself simply. The move is knight g5 attacking on e4. What we've done is we're buying our self-time, because he finally goes c5 finally interfering with the bishop he can castle, but it's a little bit too late, because what move can we now play? Despite the fact, we ask ourselves the sam shanklin question, the knee-jerk response for people is to move the bishop away, but we ask ourselves what happens if we do it anyway? What happens if we take on e4 anyway, and what we realize is that we create discovered attack potential against the king, which means that if he takes our bishop, we can, at the very least recapture his knight with a double check and send his king out he decides to castle. But now we can do what this knight on e4 combines. With the bishop on b4 we take on c5, we win the exchange and he's going to be down a whole lot of material, provided that we can complete our development, which shouldn't be that difficult. Now that we've basically destroyed his remaining forces. Yes, I will show everything after the game now. This is a very instructive moment. We are still behind the development, so it would be a good idea to trade queens if the the occasion permits, but we shouldn't limit ourselves to that thinking. Our bishop is hanging in our pawn on c3 is saying: can we defend both at the same time, rook d8 would blunder the pawn on c3, with rather devastating consequences. So don't look only at your ideas. Look also your opponent's ideas. The threat is not only king takes f8, it is also queen takes c3. We need to combine both and we do that by playing bishop to b4 sliding the bishop back again do not be afraid of retreating moves. The other benefit of this move is that rook t8 is going to come with check driving his king out. That's a pretty big deal. We also have the idea of queen c 4 chuck forcing the queen trait so depending on what he does. We either go after his king or we go after the queen trade. He can't prevent both. At the same time, at least I don't see a way to do that, particularly okay, so which one should we go for now, maybe even both which one does your intuition calls for definitely rook d8. I mean this looks like it's very close to checkmate check on f8 driving his king out. Even further and in such a situation, a lot of people struggle finding follow-ups and they forget that pawns are full-fledged attackers when you can't find a way to get to a king like this, you need to involve your pawns. Pawns can be that deciding factor which turned the attack from just strong to decisive, which fun can we involve here? Let's go g4 with tempo attacking the bishop. Not only is this a good move from an attacking perspective, but if you notice the bishop on f1, we can actually fianchetto it just for a little bit of safety for a little life insurance. We can always castle short if things go terribly wrong and we need to escape. So it's a good idea to play in this way where you defend and attack kind of at the same time, because then you insure yourself against disasters. If a disaster happens, at least we know that we will always be able to castle. In fact we can just castle so that we don't even have to worry about it. I don't want the headache of that king being out in the open okay. He gives up another rook. He was, of course pinned and that's the reason why we could afford to spend all this time. Okay, that doesn't do anything. So, let's deploy our last remaining piece, which is not doing anything and let's combine attacking the king with just taking up all of the free pawns and pieces that present themselves here. There's no science to winning a position like this tommy shelby. Oh look at this man go five gifted subs from from the unlikeliest source tommy. Thank you. Thank you for the five gifted that 1 30 hype, we're feeling it yeah. I think he is easy. Well, we don't have to worry about a measly pawn. We can drop our queen all the way to e8 with checkmate um. So this is completely winning yeah it's over. We are up too many pieces. He thinks he's thinking, but I mean there's no way he can salvage this or survive for more than a couple moves. Yeah, I'm in eastern time zone. All right, I blundered eight. I did blunder eight! Actually, that's really funny! I forgot that he was well. The hilarious thing is, I didn't even see that the rook was hanging, but the funny thing is: if he takes my rook, we take his knight. We force liquidation into a position where we're up a rook. So that's actually a good thing. That's fine um! I actually forgot that he's attacking my rope. To be honest, I didn't understand what the purpose of d5 was. I made the same mistake I tell everybody not to make. I didn't ask myself what the threat was, because I let my guard down we're up so many pieces that I kind of let my guard down but as it turns out we're so overwhelmingly better that even a blunder turns out to be a decent move. Thank you, natsukis appreciate it. Okay yeah, I'm surprised he hasn't taken it yet I mean maybe he he senses something. This move does nothing yeah. I I dismissed it too early and that's a common cause of blunders. You just dismiss the move of your opponent because it looks stupid and he resigns. So he recognizes the the uh futility of further resistance and he resides so by the way. If he takes my rook, I take his. I can even take with my queen, which is a funny thing, because bishop takes bishop take forks forex is queen and king he's got to take and we're up a look: okay um. So that was a relatively straightforward game. There were a couple of interesting moments. The first was the smoke queen e2, which pins his pawn to his king and basically he bites off a little bit more than he can chew. And here this this was the critical moment in the whole game, because most people would play c4 uh and that's a completely understandable move. You are defending your extra pawn, but the issue is that he castles and, as I explained not only does he is he castled and we aren't. But the second bad thing is that this queen on e2 uh, actually obstructs the development of our bishop. So he starts developing a very big initiative. White is probably still better, but I didn't want to allow a situation like this, and so we played bishop a3, giving up the pawn back, which allows us to open the d file and get it get a huge attack against his king. We have simply more pieces in the game than he does and he's not able to to hold everything together so takes. If he takes the bishop, we we take with the discovered check, and that is devastating and the rest is uh. It's very simple: bishop c5 bishop f8, bringing the bishop back when you have this position is also important. Tommy shelby is challenging me interesting. I gotta play him all right. I gotta play tommy. I can't pass up this opportunity. We've never played before then I'll continue the game. He is a legend okay, so he's playing the petrov where we take on e5 and he plays the stafford gambit. If only I had made a video refuting the stafford gambit well, this is my time for testing. D3 is the move now. Bishop c5 in the stafford is typical. Okay, bishop c5 in the stafford is is typical and I actually have to remember my own refutation. If I remember correctly- and just give me a second to recall this, I think the move I recommended is bishop b2 first covering the g4 square, and now we play a very important move. C3 the this is the move that refutes the stafford because it prepares the move, d4, shutting the bishop out, taking it out of commission and ending all tricks associated with the f2 square. That is the key black, is simply a pawn down and he is essentially losing uh. There is nothing to it. I made a 25 minute video on youtube, where I analyzed this in great depth. If you are interested, you are welcome to watch now, not to overstate the case here. We still need to win the game. We are up a pawn, but we still need to bring all our pieces out and we need to convert this, which will not be trivial, but we've done the job of of ending the immediate tricks. So, let's now develop our pieces, the knight will come out to d2 a nice little square notice that our nice little pawn chain in the center is well protected, he's probably going to castle long, which is fine, and if he castles along, we need to start thinking about ways that we can attack his king on the queen side. What can we do here to start the attack on his king? Well, one thing we can do. First of all, he wants to play c5 and undermine our center, which is kind of annoying. Can we do both things at once? We go b4. First of all, we prepare the pawn storm on the queen side. Second of all, we stop him from playing c5, which is very important. The other thing we do is we prepare potentially the maneuver of the knight to c5 uh, where it will be sitting on an outpost if he takes it and we open up the b file and we can use that b. File to deliver checkmate, potentially tommy is great um. Okay, so let's see what he does, let's see what he does yeah. This is what drives people crazy now he sacks the wow. That is a very strong move. Actually. Well, that's a very interesting. I'm not sure it's that strong, but it's interesting because he takes on d4 we'll have to. We have to deal with a couple threats here and what threats do we have to deal with? Specifically he's not attacking the rook? That's defended he's only attacking the bishop, but we need to be very careful about where we put this bishop, because if we drop it to e2, we give the e4 pawn up and then he develops huge pressure in the center. So where should we put the bishop in order to keep everything relatively nicely protected, we should put it on c2. You should put it on c2 and our goal here is to castle. If we can manage to castle, then any shenanigans associated with white's king and being in the centers are going to be immediately ended. That is going to be our immediate priority to castle. Now it's a little uncomfortable to be in this position with white. But let's remember that we're up a piece and he has no real threats- uh, it's always okay, so he makes a very strong bishops before stopping us from castling, but the reality is black. Doesn't have enough pieces in the game to truly inflict any damage on our position. Let's bring the bishop back to e3, get this queen out of our grill. It can actually come to c3, but then we're gonna pick this queen off with another piece. An unexpected hero is going to make its way out of the gate. What am I talking about? What is white's move here to try to get this queen out of the picture? Yeah it's coming at me, but it's fine, yeah, rook c1, let's bring the rook in. Let's try to get this queen out of here, no he's playing very, very well tommy's. Good tommy is very good. Let's get this queen out of here. He plays a brilliant move again, but let's get that queen out of here now we finally managed to get the queen out of our face, but we still have the problem now of of not being able to castle, and the culprit is this bishop on on c4? Let's try to win this bishop. Can we win this bishop charlotte chesson are still here, not rook. B1, look at the skewer kinetic energy, not rook, b1, rook b1, queen a6, come on guys, fine find the move. Bishop a4 yeah queen is overloaded. We can take the rook and we win the game. Oh, but he does have an idea and then I'll switch back to blitz. Okay. He takes on d2, we just don't want to take with the queen, because then the bishop on a4 is lost. Let's stick with the bishop and then maybe drop the bishop bishop back to b3. Okay, we're gonna see where he goes. Let's go bishop b3 trading, the bishop, then that queen's going to be stopping us from castling it's a lifelong battle, but but getting the queen out of a6 is going to be very easy. We can just interpose it with our own queen, which will come to c4 and finally, not only will be up a rook, but we are finally ready to castle. In fact, this forces the queen trade, because we are in effect forking his queen and the knight on e4 so he's got to take, takes this. He loses the knight and finally, we are going to be able to castle and we're going to win. So again, I don't care about this, this spot on e4. That's that's, not important uh. What is important is that we got rid of his bishop now we got rid of his queen and we are ready to castle on fourth queen trade, good game, tommy, okay, one second, please: okay, yeah, that was the stafford uh, as you can see it even with the reputation it's uh there's. There are some latent ideas there, but by and large um by and large, if you're, very careful, you should be able to to to to to ward up the threads e5 in what position e5 in which position c3 is well. C3 is the refutation yeah, I'm not one of several after queen b5, well, the movie 5. He can actually take on e5, for example, and if knight takes c4, he he we lose the queen with check so and also remember that, oh I guess he wanted to go. Bishop f5 check and then win the bishop, but maybe he can even drop it to d7, and then you don't have a discovery with a bishop. So but the main reason I wouldn't play e5 is because, if queen takes c5 knight takes c4 after bishop c4 is possible, but this creates some discomfort, because if you move your queen, you allow a fork. If you move it to c1, then this gets very, very dangerous. You take. He takes on e4, he gets his rook to e8 and it's very, very uh, very, very nasty. So so I think I actually played it accurately. We have to be careful in such positions, but that was basically the lay of the land [Music]. You.
