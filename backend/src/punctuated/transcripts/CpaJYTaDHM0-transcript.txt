I have not yet lost, but I will eventually lose. I mean, probably you know any time now, I'm already over 2 000. So eventually someone will come around who catches a blunder or something like that. Okay, we're gonna go with another e4 game [Music]. The openings are less important here than the games themselves, though, and now we're going to play lopez, which is my main opening, that's sort of the high level defense, okay and he plays the berlin. Now um, there's many ways to play against the berlin, but we're gonna go straight into it and we're going to go into the end game. Uh we're going to go into the berlin end game, because I want to show you guys that it's not just a draw it really. Okay, he doesn't go for the berlin, he does not go for the bull and he goes d6, which is a very passive move, but that's like the stein. It's defense, that's a legitimate variation and previously we'd been responding earlier by going c3 and d4, but now we're at a higher rating. Let's play more topically. Let's play d4 immediately opening up the center. Why do we open up the center because he's played passively so in order to exploit that we want to maximally open things up so that we can emphasize our advantage in development now? The theory in this position is to capture on c6, with the bishop, keeping our knight centralized, making a little defect defect in his queen side, pawn structure. Now, here's the thing: what do we want to do? He wants to play c5 to dislodge our knight from the center right, and it would be very, very nice if we could put our knight on f5, but if we put our knight on f5, let's say right now, then he will capture that knight and if we capture with the pawn uh, that makes our king side pawn, structure bad and it removes upon from the center b4 would be a little bit artificial, because that would weaken the night. It would weaken the pawn. We don't actually need to prevent c5. What we need to do is we need to prepare the move knight f5 in response to it, remember that prophylaxis can come from both directions. You can prevent the move itself, but you can also prepare a response against the move and queen f3 is the best way to do that, because that is also conducive to the general goals of the position. You simply bring a queen a piece onto a better square and we can continue to do that by bringing the bishop in. We don't have to go knight f5, yet we we can only do that in response to c5. Now we have a lot of pressure on his position. He goes knight, g4, okay, so hmm, let me think yeah, so we can win a pawn here. We have a cool way of winning upon who sees it yeah, so the knight on g4 what jumps to mind for me. Actually, it doesn't win a pawn. There's ooh, there's some really cool complications. It actually does not win upon never mind and I'll. Show you guys this after the game. Um scrap that scrap that I'll show you guys why it doesn't win a pawn, but not right now, because uh, because our time is ticking. So let's take the bishop and obviously this knight is super annoying. So, let's kick it away, let's go h3 get out of here get out of here now. Where should we move our queen in the interest of the fact that we are trying to attack his king? Where should we position our queen? What's sort of the typical square of the typical squares, of course, g3 and potentially we can chase the knight away with f4, although I would I I would not play this move prematurely. Okay, so he's gone c5 in such situations. We always ask ourselves. First and foremost, what squares does a move like this leave behind? Obviously, knight f5 was what we previously attended. Now, it's not quite as strong, but there is the move, knight, d5 and noticing the queen, and now we can go knight f5. I previously said that it's not ideal that we have a pawn that lands on f5, but the situation has changed a little bit now. This pawn is actually an asset. Why is it an asset because we can go f6 and combine with the queen? Let's apply the same logic f6. What square does this weaken? Can we get a piece to that square? Tell me the maneuver, exactly knight, f4 and knight e6, very methodical. Look at this juicy outpost on e6 with the knight his knight on e5 is not on an outpost. We can always chase it away by playing f4. We don't need to rush with that move, but when the time comes, we can play that move f4. Now, why shouldn't we rush with that move? There's a deep logic behind this. What do we not want him to do? What we don't want him to do is to trade off this knight and the only way that he can trade off this night is by using his own knight, okay. So what we want to do, dr, along with job, is rookie one. We are anticipating that he's eventually going to try to trade off the knights and so we're adding some beef to that knight in preparation. For that now we go rookie for dual purpose: move number one. We can double to lend more supports than a number two. We can rook left. That would be another drawback of the move out. Four. We would prevent our own ability to rook lift okay, so he he loses his patience decides to exchange sacrifice, but the hesitation should tell you that he's realized that he missed something, and that is the move, f4, of course, attacking the queen. It's not that simple. He can move his queen away and attack the knight, but I saw that this is also why we played rookie four. Let's not forget the other purpose. What's the move? What's the move? Now we play the simple, the simple darker thank you for the sub. Well, queen e3 would violate the small principle we talk about, which is that when you have a task that you can do with one piece, you should usually do it with that piece rather than the queen. The queen should be left at the sort of most important tasks. We double rooks and we get to e8 if he moves his knight away. Yeah backrank mate is not going to happen cleanly because he can get his knight to f8, but he's going to be driven very much to the back, but let's not rush, and this is the importance of not rushing. I a lot of people would immediately give a check on ea, but we need to spend a couple seconds in any position asking ourselves like. Is there something better? Is there something that maybe wins the game in a slightly cleaner way, and that is the rookie? Seven rookie also wins, but he has knight fa and somehow he's holding on there. I could go rookie seven, but what I want to show is that principle right, you spent three four five seconds nobody's died over three four five seconds and uh. We find a move that ends the game immediately, because we have a fork against uh the knight in the pawn and the game is over, so he loses his knight. He loses the game, very simple sort of straightforward, applying principles by the book and that can produce some very effective chess. Now, let's do piggies on the seventh and um he goes richard, so he continues to play. He's completely lost. How do we win this position? There are several approaches I think the most again, if we're playing this by the book. The simplest approach is to try to get a rook on on this on the eighth rank uh, and in order to do that, we finally involve our queen. We go queen e3 and rookie a that would be the most sort of you know, kind of like okay, it's not the best, but it's the simplest right. We trade rooks and when we trade rocks the win is going to be super simple. We don't need to take immediately either. We can first help ourselves to a couple pawns. That's going to lighten our load a little bit, I'm sure that there were faster, wins but again part of the the in the speed run, I'm never playing badly on purpose, but sometimes I'm playing uh differently than I would normally play in order to illustrate the range of ideas available to us now, instead of trading rooks well, we can actually just go rook c8 here. That would be the simplest. We take he's actually kind of hanging on here, which is kind of funny, but we can give a check here and now the simple idea would be to get a rook to the sixth rank. How can we get the rook to e6? We want the rook to get to e6. How do we do that? Who can tell me rookie, 8 and rookie 6 is going to end the game one way or another. It's going to be either checkmate or it's going to win the queen, rookie 6, queen h4, queen f7, is going to be mate and queen f7 here he's going to be a pretty mate. We can even troll him a little bit if he goes king h4. If he goes king h4, we control him by taking on h6 or what's going to be the actual checkmate. Who can tell me what the mate is going to be? Let's see if I can. Ah let me let me do some professional trolling. Let me do some professional trolling I was gonna go. I was gonna sack my queen. I was gonna, go here and and then here but uh. Sadly, he didn't didn't. Allow us to to do that. Um. I was gonna see if we have a way of sacrificing both the rook and the queen. That would be pretty cool, but no okay. Let's look at the game, so the berlin is knight, take c4 uh. We won't delve into the theory here, god forbid uh, but uh the the berlin. The idea behind the berlin is: is this end game right? You guys all probably know that this leads to the berlin end game and at some point I might talk a little bit about the berlin game uh. You know I might talk a little bit about the berlin game uh, but but not right. Now this is, you know, extremely theoretical, so he goes d6, which is kind of um, which is kind of passive and d4 directly follows the principle of opening up the center when our opponent plays a little bit passively. Why is this move passive because? Well because it prevents his bishop from developing to c5, which is the most active square? This is not a bad line. I've played d6 myself, but it's a little bit um. You know it it. It is something that you have to play. If you know it very well, because you can easily slip into a bad position which is essentially what happens so take stakes. Bishop d7 knight c3 developing bishop e7 uh bishop takes c6, which is the theoretical move right uh. We are trading bishop for night, leaving our knight in the center and forcing him to introduce a defect into his spawn structure. If he takes with a bishop, we can take that bishop or we could consider putting the knight on f5 straight away, so he takes to the pawn and we go queen f3. Now, when would you play c3 before d4, so we could have played c3 even in this line? It's often a matter of taste here. I wanted to just illustrate a slightly different way of playing now um the idea behind queen f3, as I explained during the game. If we make just any random move, he goes c5 and we have to drop our knight back, because if we go knight f5, he takes on f5, and this is actually quite unpleasant right. We don't want to get our pawn to f5, which is nicely blockaded by the knight and can be easily attacked by the queen, and our pawn on e4 was controlling the center. So now he has this an kind of nasty idea. Well, defense and pawn structure, actually don't matter that much and that's something I've been explaining throughout uh. It's just that the higher you get right. The more- and I explained this the last time the more importance is assigned to these small factors, because small factors when taken together uh can decide the game, and one of those small factors is differences in pawn structure. While they don't usually decide the outcome of the game in and of themselves you, you know, you don't just want to make free weaknesses, if that makes sense, so queen f3 preparing to get the knight to f5 so that we can capture with the queen. Okay, he castles. We go bishop g5 and he goes knight g4 now here a lot of you were wondering why I didn't play knight takes c6 and the the point of this move is it's a simple overloading tactic. The bishop on d7 is doing two things at once. It cannot um accomplish them, it's defending the knight and it was protecting the pawn. So we take the pawn overloading the bishop. Now bishop takes c6 problem is we cannot take the knight immediately because uh he he plays bishop, takes g5 and wins a piece now we're also attacking the queen here. So if he takes immediately, then we win as queen, but it seems that white can simply take the bishop on e7 and now I started thinking about intermediate moves and black is a desperado sacrifice. The knight is hanging he's going to lose it anyway, so he might as well give it up for a pawn, but it's very important that this move also attacks white's queen. So if we count up the pieces queen knight bishop takes queen knight takes queen, we get an equal pawn end game white's got a ruined, kingside, pawn structure, not impressive. Of course. We can also take the knight, but then black takes the bishop and black's. Bishop is super good here. It's pressuring the pawn black and combine that with f5. So this moon knight takes h2. What did I say about details defining games at this level? That's what I mean now you might be rated a thousand, and hopefully I've explained this in a way where you should understand the rationale behind this line right. It's not that it's impossible to understand, but calculating this in the heat of a game can be difficult. Really, that's all there is to it. It's not that it's particularly complicated. Now, if you and if you take on e7 first and I take c6 now it's well- it's actually different. Why is knight takes h2, not the same thing? Who can explain to me why this is not the same thing? First of all and second of all for extra credit. What is black's move in this position? Similar concept knight takes queen, comes with check, and even if it didn't, this square is undefended. So what should black do instead very nasty little move? What black can do here is, and I'm not sure how bad this is, but queen h4 is what I didn't like he's attacking mate and threatening c6. It gets complicated. I decided not to go for that good job, so we played h3 chasing the knight away, reposition the queen on g3, where x-rays, the king c5. What is the drawback of this move? A high weakens d5. Can we go there immediately? No, we can't knight is being attacked, but wait a second. Yes, we can because it attacks the queen. Could we have gone knight? F5? Yes, absolutely not a bad move takes takes, but I was a little bit worried about trading too many pieces. Remember that when you're up in space and when you're trying to attack trades can lighten the load for your opponent, so you know I just wasn't sure. I didn't think this was a necessary thing to do immediately and this would not have been bad. Can you explain the decision to trade, dark square bishops? Well, uh. You know, I suppose we could have dipped our bishop back, but I didn't want to let him activate his bishop and put it on the long diagonal. So this isn't something I'm like I love to do, but the alternative wastes more time and it allows him to put his bishop on a super good square, okay, uh, so anyways, so queen g3, c5, knight, t5, and now we play knight f5 and it's very important, as I've preached several times to use the method of comparison to understand the differences between two different things. Compare them don't try to understand each individually that can be tough comparison, can yield tremendous levels of instruction about a set of ideas or a certain position, and specifically here I want you to compare this position to this position in both positions. We've got this little defect in our pawn structure, three pawns here and upon an f5 doubled, but there's one key difference as I hinted at during the game. What is that difference? There's many differences, of course, but um there's one difference that makes this good for white well number one. The queen is more active, that's that's an ancillary phenomenon, but all of this is leading up to the fact that the pawn is not blockaded and it actually wants to go to f6. Even if he goes c6, we go f6 because we threaten checkmate forcing him to either create tremendous weaknesses in his kingside, which sets up a potential lobster pincermate or create weaknesses in his king side like this, when we can basically coordinate for a second away with the attack. So this one difference again: small differences make the game go, make the world go round. He plays f6 to blockade the pawn, but now he creates a massive weakness on e6, which we occupy immediately now the move f4 very tempting wrong because it actually helps him get his knight to d8 and trade off our knight. So what we do is we preemptively play rookie one f4 is not going anywhere. His knight alone is not going to cause any problems to us right and um we're only going to go out for when we are ready to protect this knight. In addition, uh we are preparing to lift our rope. Why rookie, wouldn't well d1 orwell, would not really uh go about defending this night uh. You know he can move his queen away. I get that you wanted to pin the queen, but this rook is kind of lame and I can't lift it because d4 square is protected. Absolutely. Why did I choose a rook and not the f1? I'll put it this way guys. I think in this specific case. Both moves are perfectly fine, but visually, and I went by my intuition here. It just seemed a good idea to keep another rook near my king, for whatever reason I wasn't exactly even sure why, but I thought that maybe you know maybe, when I play f4, this rook will somehow maneuver through f3 to g3 it's a minuscule difference. I think this was just as good, but there was something about that particular concept that I liked. That's really all there is to it. I don't think it really matters here. It's it doesn't make a huge difference in every case you shouldn't overthink it uh. So now we go rookie four as planned and he loses his patience now. I already think he's basically lost if he tries to get his knight around to trade. We can do two things. We can lift our rook up and we can follow that up. Who can tell me a very, very powerful, attacking idea here? White wins the game with a very pretty tactical sequence, queen g6 h6, and now we notice type 2 on defended pieces. Rook h7, I don't think quite does the trick. We notice that black's queen is overloaded, knight takes g7. Overloading very important rope takes h6 is a little more complicated. I think you've got to be careful here. I don't see a follow-up here. Remember when you only have two pieces in the attack be super careful about sacrificing keeping. It simple often pays a lot of dividends in the end, so he goes rookie six and now f4 either wins the night or uh allows us to infiltrate the back two ranks. A rookie 8 would have also been perfectly good uh, but we decided to play it very simple and just win as night. The rest is the rest is very straightforward: okay, it would take c7 broke cc8, forcing the trade on our terms and that basically ends the game. What if he plays rook g8, where oh at the end of that line? Well, if he plays rook g8, we just check made up on h6 right once we take a pawn like this, we remove the bottom jenga and the whole thing collapses. Any questions about this game I feel like it was relatively simple conceptually and I want to show you guys one really really instructive moment from one of my games that builds on a concept that we that we talked about here. The concept that we talked about here is the notion of supporting an outpost right. We had this outpost on e6 and our opponent expressed the desire to treat it by maneuvering migrating his knight to d8, and that can actually change the game. Whether or not we can retain a piece on an outpost can can really be the game-changing phenomenon, and so one of the hardest things to do in chess. One of the things that you do you learn to do when you become good is to find creative ways of maintaining a piece on a particular square, particularly maintaining a knight on an outpost, and I had the chance to do that in a game that I played a couple years ago when I was in im- and I believe that I found a very, very nice idea, which I'd like to show you guys this game is from philadelphia, open 2013.. I made my second grandmaster norm at this tournament and uh. The following position arose in round two. I am playing with the white pieces, my opponent 2100. In this position. I found a very nice tactical idea. I call this a positional combination because it's tactical in nature, but the goal is positional. It's like a tactical maneuver, and it's not that difficult to see. If you make the proper observations for keeping that going so drum roll, the move is knight d4 and the idea is to get the knight to e6 and uh. Once the knight gets on e6, that's a beautiful outpost, it's protected by the pawn now there's a couple of things that uh that need to be explained about this, but philly boy, 44.. Some people notice that the move knight h4, creates two threats: knight takes f5 and knight g6 problem with this move. Is that um and let me actually remember what the problem with this move is: uh knight's rule is actually not bad, but but there was something I think I can play queen f7 and if you take the pawn, you expose a very nasty little attack down the f file. Black can move his knight away and uh. If white's knight moves, then queen takes f2 is going to be quite unpleasant. This is not bad, but it leads to some uh questionable consequences. Now the key question about knight d4, what makes this tactical is the fact that you have to evaluate knight takes d5, but what you guys have to understand is that this puts the knight and the king on the same diagonal and the move. Bishop b3 is going to be absolutely devastating. The knight is being attacked queen f7 is the only defense and now queen f3 is a simple move that wins not only this night, but also the other night. You're gonna win both nights with the bishop there. It is now. Why is bishop e3 immediately bad? The reason is that in basketball, you know you can telegraph the pass. You know when you when you go like this, you know exactly who, who you're going to pass it to, and you signal to your opponent, hey. I want to play knight t496. What's the opponent going to do bonus? Good? No you're, not! Oh you! I'm going to move my queen queen to d7 guess what the only reason that knight d4 was possible was because of the temporary phenomenon of the pit and that's something you have to exploit immediately knight d4. Does that make sense: okay, 2796 rook fe-8! Now now he does threaten to take on d5 because he's gonna chop the legs off of the knife, so queen f3, is what I played. Okay knight takes d5, I'm gonna take with the bishop witho the queen. Now he goes knight to d8 here's. What the battle revolves around is he gonna be able to trade that knight on e6 and obviously the answer is: yes, there's nothing. I can do about the trade. But what do I do? What do I do in this position in order to make sure that that knight is going to be replaced by something even stronger, bishop3 is correct, queen takes f5 would be inferior on the count of knight takes d5 and the knight loses its support. So I go bishop b3 right and if he takes on e6, I take with the pawn he has to move his queen and look at this beaut on e6. It's not a knight, but it's the next best thing: okay, uh and after rook a7 I play queen takes f5 and he plays king h8 and in this position I found the move uh and the reason that I'm showing you this game consists in this move. Now, what is my opponent threatening? Why did he play king h8? The move that he played here is knight takes the move that he intends is knight takes d5. This is a simple undermining sacrifice. Well, not a sacrifice. Sorry tactic: you cannot take this knight because the queen is pinned and if you play bishop takes d5, then he plays knight 66, restoring material equality, and I know- and most importantly I no longer have an outpost on e6, so I've really achieved very little here. Uh well yeah, dirty devin I'll mention that later. But my question then, is man. I really want to keep this knight on e6. You know I really. I don't want to just give it away and I can't take on d8, because the queen hangs, if you go knight takes g7, then he's just gonna take on g7 with the queen or the king by the way. So what the hell do we do, and in this position I was able to find the kind of thing that I described to you guys, prophylaxis in a tactical way, so nobody's seen the move yet actually now, let me tell you how was how I was able to find the move. This is hard guys and g4, I would say, is probably the second best move, although it's a little weakening now. The way that I thought about it is this: let's imagine, and I call this the worst case scenario test when you're trying to find a prophylactic move. That is, when you're trying to find a way to stop your opponent's threat, and it's not obvious how to stop it. What I suggest doing is, first, assuming that your opponent accomplishes that you let him do whatever he wanted to do all right. You and I'll get to people's suggestions. In a moment you let him do what he wants to do, and you think, okay, let's fork, let's broadcast to the final position, and let's look at this for a second. What move could white potentially have here? What would it be nice if white had in this position? He can't make this move, but what would it be? Nice yeah, bishop c6? Wouldn't it be nice if you could play bishop c6 and bend the queen to the rook, and I thought wait a second I can set this up and so in the starting position. Rook a to c1 is the move, and this move I was quite proud of this is- and I think you guys would agree with me. Not only is this prophylactic, but it brings a piece into the game. It's a productive move as a standalone move and it prevents knight takes d5. He did this anyway, so I'll show you guys what happened in the game, but that's how I thought about it and that's the logic that I want you guys to apply in many many different cases. I can give you another test position where that logic is applied directly now. Some of you, okay, knight d4, is a very interesting move, but it fails tactically because after ed queen d7 rook d7, the knight defends the rook on e8. Now g4, I think, is quite good, and I really like that people came up with this. The idea being after knight takes d5 knight takes d, the queen is protected, and so bishop takes d5 is going to follow. I love that mode. G4 is probably almost as good. I would say that it's a tiny bit weakening on the king's side, so maybe he can do something like this and you know he's still kicking because because we've got some of these weaknesses, but I think g4 is also very, very good rocket. Thank you for the sub queen h5 blunders, the queen and uh. I think the other moves have you know. Small tactical defects, queen f3, is also very good, but I wanted to keep my queen active. Maybe here he plays knight, f7 and tries to get his knight to g5, so rookie c1 he took on d5 and then bishop c6 happened, and now I play the move queen, e4 and d4. Much like we did in that speed run game, the idea being. If knight takes d4 queen d4 because of the pin he loses so knight take rook takes c5 and he resigned in this position uh. That, basically, was why I wanted to show you this game. This idea of working backwards, starting from the final position trying to set up an idea that could have occurred in that final position is uh, is an interesting one, and let me show you guys one more example of me doing that and then we'll play one last game. So I had one other example that I can remember where I managed- and I was quite proud of doing this- where I did something similar okay. So this is my game from 2006 against an international master. He was also my first coach okay, so this guy was good. It was a night off yeah. That's what I used to play. Okay, that's what I used to play and um in this position. I was able to find what I think is a really nice prophylactic idea now in order to understand this. What is the purpose of the move? H4? What is my opponent's next move going to be, and I'm not asking a trick question here, obvious question I mean just go on: no, not no don't overthink it h4. What does he want? H5? He wants to play h5. You know let's play h5 and then he wants to play h6. I don't want to allow this. I don't want him to do this. I also don't want to play h6, because that creates a hook which you can then use to play g5 using the pawn as a battering ram. So I applied the same logic and I asked myself: okay wait a second, let's imagine that he plays h5 and let's try to detect. Thank you wolf. What new weaknesses in his position are created? Well wait a second. I thought this is a type 2 undefended bishop, it's only protected by the queen. That seems like a vulnerable piece. Could I try to preemptively set up a tactic against that bishop in the event of h5? Thank you, jose mvp, with the rate of the party of 51, really appreciate. It hope you had a great team. Welcome guys we're doing the speed, run, we're doing some lectures and you guys are getting it. The move is queen to d8. I was really proud of this move during the game move his queen to d a now. It's not necessarily the best move. According to the computer, what is the idea? The idea is if he goes h5, then I play knight, takes e4 and exposes the attack on the bishop. If bishop takes e7, this is a check and if rook takes c4, then I play bishop takes g5 and I win the pawn uh. This would not have been possible without the queen on d8, because I would not have had enough attacks on the bishop. He would have simply recaptured it. Segfaulting for the prime appreciate it now queen. C5 would also do that with the same idea. Uh and I think queen c5 would have been interesting, but maybe here he goes bishop e3 and he x-rays the queen in the game. He also played bishop b3 and I had time to maneuver my queen to maneuver my pieces. I didn't have to move my queen knight, d7, f4 and back to f6, and I was able to slam my knight in t, but this is not a trick. I mean. Does this look like I'm going for tricks? No, this is. I think this is pretty high level prophylaxis, I'm actually trying to stop his ideas and- and I won the game. So I'm not saying this is the best uh, but I'm trying to give you guys an example of this kind of backwards thinking you assume that your opponent accomplishes his threat and then you try to detect retroactively the drawbacks of that and then you try to, I was meaning to say, retroactively, exploit them in the starting position: clear. Okay, let's move on. I know that I'm dragging on about this, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful and let's uh finish with uh one more one. More speed run game. Okay, at what age did you first beat a master? I think it was like probably 2004, maybe eight or nine [Music] you.
