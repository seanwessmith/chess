[Music], ladies and gentlemen, all right, let's go we'll, be getting some emotes any day. Now. Yes, yes, any day now guild wars, okay, let's go d4 this time, let's go d4. Let's play some main lines: let's play uh names. This is called the nimzo indian defense. Now I will explain this after the game properly, but I'm going to play a move which I play as my main line. That is the move f3. The idea behind this is very simple. I want to play e4 eric thanks for the sub. Now we want to go a3 to chase the fish away, worrying that I will explain all of the theory after the game. Basically, you get this structure now. What should you guys notice about the structure? What does the battle revolve around? The battle revolves around one very specific thing, very specific thing: it depends which way he takes knight takes. Okay is white. Going to make be able to play. E4 is white, going to be able to play for under the correct conditions. I can't play e4 now, even if I technically could I'm not developed so every action that I undertake from this point onwards is going to be directed at preparing e4 as fast as possible and developing this bishop is not essential to preparing e4. I need to develop the king side so that I can castle quickly so that I don't have to keep my king in the center when I do play four. So, let's, let's see what I do e3. Where am I going to put this bishop? Where am I going to put this bishop d3, then I'm going to put the knight on e2 I'm going to castle and I'm going to at some point be ready to play, for this is the theoretical line. Black has several ways that he can go about trying to stop e4 uh. But this is theory. This line is not considered to be black's best, but even magnus has played it before. So it's it's very much legitimate and um 92 castles and I will explain afterward whether we will be ready to play e4 well, if c4, then, bishop b2, we don't have to worry about c4 c4. Bishop c2 doesn't actually obstruct a rookie. 80 stops it now. Where can this knight end up to prepare e4? Where can this knight go with the express purpose of preparing e4 bingo g3? Okay? So it's not. He does play c4, but here's the problem with the moves before he takes the pressure off of the pawn on d4, and can you guys see that now, if I play e4, I also have to deal with this pawn becoming weaker once he plays c4 the pawn on d4 is better protected, so I can direct all of my attention at preparing me for it would be possible to play before here. But what do I need to do? First, as a good russian school boy that I am, let's be patient and let's castle well, space isn't important here. Space is a sort of okay transformational advantage. Space is like money, I'll explain what I mean. So. Finally, we can consider playing e4, but let's be good russian skill voice, and I guarantee you guys if we can prepare this well. E4 is going to be a lot stronger, so let's play knight g3 first. Why? Because, ultimately, the knight can go to f5 in some positions and there's nothing. He can do to stop before once we play e4 we're going to just steamroll him on the king's side, and I want you to watch very carefully how I go about doing that here we go yeah so time it goes okay. So how do we do? How do we do this? There is a very typical idea here. I will show you guys after this game, a game in which I I applied this idea. How do we make something of this pawn of these pawns? Can anybody tell me yeah? We just pushed the pawns boom, locking this in and then boom boom. Now we're not just doing this to win a piece, although he can't avoid that, even if this wasn't winning a piece, this would just be crushing. You guys should just kind of see that now bishop g5 is a good thought, but he could play h6 and notice that the knight on g6 is covering the h4 square and the game is basically over. So that's how effective this line can be. If, if black isn't very precise, that's why I really play that's. Why I like playing- and I've won a couple nice okay. So five is a good move and here's the thing um. What is the top item on our wish list? The top item on our wish list is to eventually get our pawn to f5 and the move on poissant comes to mind, but I actually am sound would be good, but I'm going to play well. Actually. Yan poisson would be really good, because the good thing about amphison is that if he recaptures, then we have f5 winning a piece. The problem. Without passant it is emotionally hard for me to part ways with my pawn sort of my pawn mass but uh. You have to transform your advantage at some point and you you can't cling to something. That's nice. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings as they say in literature, yeah. I'm writing down notes to explain after the game kill your kill. Your darlings is a phrase my english teacher used to describe you know something you have to do in writing where sometimes you get very clingy about a phrase that you think is good and that actually holds you up in terms of expressing your thoughts better, so we're just gonna like autopilot this. What do we do now just bash it in, and this is the good thing right our pieces look at how well prepared they are to attack the king's side. Well, queen g4 is tempting, but actually queen g4 is a really good move. Yeah queen g4 is good, but let's go f6. Let's open up yeah. This is very violent terminology. I don't know where I I don't know why. I'm all of a sudden said talking about the violently queen g4 would be good but um. Let's, let's do let's do this. Let's open up the mission now, let's figure out exactly what we want to do queen g4 here. I know it's on a lot of people's minds, but let's be methodical: if we go queen g4, he can play bishop g6 and he can stop. I will explain knight f6, we had bishop g5, so he can stop the bleeding on the g file. So what we need to do is we need to find a way to bring another piece into the attack and we need to circumvent his attack on the g6 square, his control of it. There is a different square that this pawn now controls, and that is the g7 square. I know you guys are why the hell is he taking well by taking on f6 he's opening up the possibility of me pinning him remember how you decide whether a pin is dangerous. Is there a pawn protecting the pinned piece notice that alliteration? In this case there is no pawn protecting the pin piece, and so that pin is going to be absolutely deadly. We're just going to pile up on this night and we're going to win the night and you're going to guys are going to see piling up. All I'm doing is piling up in the night. Winning the night transforming our advantage up a piece in the end game. The game is over. That's it! That's all! I did, let's bring the rook into the game and defend the rook. Okay. Now knight f5 here doesn't work because we lose control of our rook, but we want to get the knights five. So we need to move the rook first. Where should we move the rook? We can also take on h7. That's a good move, but let's go rook d6, that's the most active square for the rook, because if his rook moves away from e7, we can go to d7. Everything I'm doing should be making sense in terms of the attack. Okay. So now that's a good move. If we take it, he takes back, but we're going to do that anyway, because now we can take d5. That was another reason I played rook d6 um. Well, we keep getting sub bombs. Okay. Now, let's just check again, I want to emphasize that in the in this situation there are so many ways to win these positions. Sorry, let me repeat, though, okay, so I wanted to repeat moves. I didn't want to lap to double get games guild and uh. That was nice. Thank you and he also watches my stream so f3. The f3 is called the sameish variation and by the way. Yes, it's it's the same issue in both the king's indian and in the nimzo indian friedrich. Samish had a thing for the move, f3 and let me tell you he introduced some very serious lines into chess. Oh, I am kyle iron man, 500 bits. F3 was first played in the year uh, let's see when it was first played. It was first played in the year 18, I'm sorry in 1930 by rottenstein, but he didn't play it well. Boggle you off effin bubble. You above max irva world champion played f3 samish. Actually I this is interesting, so samish actually never played f3, but a3 is also the same, as should often transposes why I can go a3 first and only play f3 later. This is also the sameish and this samish actually did play so he sort of played this, but I'm not sure why it's necessarily called the same. Okay. Now, let's unpack what happened in the game, I think that for black, the move knight takes d5 is better because black immediately piles up on the base of the pawn chain. This is a theoretical line. I've also played games here. I'm not going to delve into this, but e takes d5 is the old-school main line now? What should black do here? Black's main line is essentially to find a way to trade. The bishop, who can tell me how black can try to trade the bishop? Why do you trade, the bishop, to make it harder for white to prepare e4, because the bishop is the main supervisor of that all operation, malcolm is on fire, b6 and bishop a6? Now you can say well no big deal I can step aside, but now look at how good black's bishop is and in a situation like this, it's harder to move the knight out because of the pin, so it becomes quite a bit harder to prepare before so in this situation, you actually don't do anything you just castle and that's that leads to some main light theory I'll show you guys the game in the slide. So what are we so c4 is a mistake because it takes the gas pedal off of the d4 pawn at least keeping that tension would have made it harder for me to prepare for and once we play e4 it's almost winning for white, because this is just completely unstoppable um. I almost think this is losing. I just don't know what black can do about this, and let me show you guys a higher level game where I actually did something very, very similar and beat a very strong player with this line. Now the game, I'm about to show you it's a little bit more complicated. So I want you guys to prepare for some more a little bit more messiness than in this game. Okay, so basically this game, I played f3 and I'll talk about space's money when we actually analyze. Well, so you can, you guys, can see r dot, cataloo 500 bits you guys can see um what he's doing. Here's knight g3 and now the move. Bishop b2- and I want people to help me explain this move. Why the hell are we putting the bishop on a square where it's literally blocked in buried alive by these two pawns? Exactly malcolm have tucker is on fire. Today, I've noticed you're on a roll, loving the engagement, my friend. So basically we support 600 bits from mine called iron man, 400 500 600. Here we go basically it it protects d4. So if we imagine when we do play e4- and I did uh- you can see that in a situation like this, the pawn on d4 is uh is b, is being very well protected by the bishop, and the bishop has a lot of what fill in the blank. The bishop has a lot of blank link using terminology that we uh, that we have formulated potential energy, bingo potential energy. All right bishop has a lot of potential energy. It's bad right now, but it's doing something really good. Rook c8, rook, 81, rookie 2, so I didn't play e4 yet and the reason I didn't play e4 is because he takes and what super nasty move does black now have. This is why patience is so important. You have to always be attentive to why your opponent does what they do queen c2 so now laptop plays knight, f8 e4, knight, g6, threatening the fork. So I step away with my queen. If we go e5 here, he counter forks, my king and my queen and rock knight f4. We just go rookie f2 and now watch what happens watch what happens [Music]. So basically this gets me these incredible pawns. The game went on uh. He didn't resign here, but black is lost uh and it took me some finessing, but eventually I played e6. His king was weak. I got the bishop to a good square. We went into an end game. I got my pawn to e7 mozart of cheese. Thank you. I won the other pawn and he resigned here because I'm just winning f7 and the pawns won me the game, that's pretty symbolic. Essentially this is exactly what happens here. E takes f6 and f5 fg and now f6. Why am I playing this move? Well, the logical reason is to open up the bishop, but if knight takes f6, we go bishop g5 and his knight is busted. Also, like you guys, should look at this position and it should be very clear to everybody that white is completely winning. I mean look at just look at the amount of pieces that are in the attack. You shouldn't have to always worry about exactly how you're going to make things happen. Um. You should use your intuition here to determine that you're going to have something here I mean black's position is just on its last legs and we do the same thing we did in the game. Why is space like money? So money is something that society assigns value to. Money has no inherent value. I can get out a one dollar bill or a 20 bill, and somebody from a completely different culture would not necessarily understand its value. It's a piece of paper, and it we agree that it is value, so you can use it to buy stuff and that stuff potentially has inherent value um. Something that we can all agree is valuable. Like a computer, most people nowadays can agree, it's valuable uh and don't nitpick. You understand what I'm saying space and time in chess tempi time and space is the same concept. Space has no inherent value unless you make something of it. So just grabbing space to graph space is sometimes good, but it's only good in so far as you can transform it into some other advantage and uh. Some people, I think, have a hard time with this, because uh space advantage is actually one of the most innocuous types of advantages you can use it very well. I'm never particularly good with a big space advantage, but you can also play when you're cramped to the last two rows. That's not necessarily a deal breaker to some positions. Okay, so just wanted to make that clear, um, I would say when you get to extra material, that is closer to an inherent value kind of thing. It's normally in any position. An extra piece has immediate value toward winning the game. Space needs to be transformed into something before it literally wins you the game: okay, uh anyway, so the rest of the game was very simple: we um, we win the piece here and that's it we're up a piece and the game is over. So I really like the same variation of the nimso and uh. It's black has other ways that he can play against the c5 as possible. Here, that's probably black's, most popular line in the modern day. Also he can drop his bishop back. You can that's the hyper modern approach. You could let white have a huge center and then chip away at it with a move like e5. That's another good line, so I don't want to bog ourselves down with the theory, but that was your introduction to the samish. If you're a d4 player, I would highly consider taking this on. Let's see how magnus went about preventing this stuff, oh 300 bits. Thank you so much and it never stops. Thank you and c4. So here's how anand prepares it. He goes g4. He gets the pawn out there first to fianchetto the bishop, because this bishop will otherwise have a hard time. Developing carlson goes for the queen side pressure and you can see that anand does manage to organize e4, that's how he does it. He puts the bishop on g2 instead of d3. Anand was better in this game. Carlson won in the end. It was a complicated game, we're not going to go into it right now, but um, but but a non digi 4. In the end. So you can see you found an alternate method of doing it. Let's get one last game in one last speeder in game and let's go back to playing e5, so knight f3, knight c6, and we have a four knights defense. So there's many ways of playing against the four knights. Now one very topical line is to go knight to d4 here I'll, explain this after the game. Okay, so white goes for the drawing line. Yeah, I was going to say. The drawback of this is that white has this line which ends in mass liquidation, so we have to take his knight. He takes mine. If I take on p2, he takes the bishop and he develops a lot of his pieces. So we've got to take on f6 and um. We get this very symmetrical position, two bishops, each it's not a draw, but it's equal. So we gotta develop our bishop he's gonna castle. Now can we castle or does this blunder upon on d7? Can we castle or does this blunder upon these we're getting a raid? Oh, my god, don't tell me we're getting another raid by who we can. Why can we castle? Why is bishop d7 on a move because of rook d8, exactly guys very nice, we pin him so we got to notice these things. Bishop d3, look at this bishop on c5 very carefully. It's undefended, which means he's threatening queen h5. Do we need to stop queen h5, or could we defend the bishop and if so, how? What can we do? Zion pure and hard, thank you for the raid. Sorry, I might have a story. D6 is exactly right: good job, guys, d6 defense, the bishop g6 defends against me. This is probably still theory and now, let's deploy the bishop. Now we got to be careful about where we develop it because actually, let's not develop. Let's, let's get the rook to an open file. First, let's be a little bit more flexible. Now we have to trade queens that oh okay, queen h or wow. This is still probably theory, and I think I got myself in some trouble here. I forgot about that move. Um [Music]! Do you guys see why I'm in trouble? Because bishop f6 is a big problem? So here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make a little envelope for the queen, I'm gonna go h5 and the idea of this move is to get the queen to h6 uh. At least my queen is in the game. I am weakening my king side. That is true, but at least the queen is in the game. Um. I haven't lost to anybody who wasn't using an engine yet, but I will ultimately and uh you guys might be like well. How do you know that it's worth making the week now a4? What is the threat? What should we do yeah? So this threatens b4 and a5. We need to create a hole for our bishop. Let's do that with the move, a6 yeah, it's making the best of an unfortunate situation. You got to learn how to do that. If you want to be good because a lot of people they blunder and they get so dejected immediately, they don't realize that the situation isn't as bad as they're. Making it out to be so a5 would have weakened the b5 square, which is a very minor point, but just so you guys know the move a5. What we can be found out. Why am I not afraid of b4? I actually want him to go before because that would weaken the c3 plot, I'm trying to lure him into creating weaknesses so that I can somehow counterbalance the fact that he has pressure on the king's side if that makes sense. Okay, so rookie one, let's get the bishop out um. This should be six preserving the rooks on the board. That gives the game a little bit more flavor. We could have also gone bishop d7 that might have even been better uh supporting the rockanita kind of missed. That move to be honest, but this is fine um, so, let's see what he what he ends up doing still a pretty dry position, not much going on um. We have a nice bishop. Bishop f6, queen h6, is fine for us and um. Of course we want to play for a win here. That's just what I want to do. So, let's see what he does. Maybe he over presses and um. This is annoying. No, this line is very annoying. I forgot about it to be honest, okay, so what should we do? He wants to trade bishops. We need to decide whether we trade and if we are going to trade, we need to decide on what terms we want to trade. So actually we are going to trade and the basic reason is I get his queen out of h4, where it was annoying me by preparing bishop essex. Now we have an opportunity. We need to use this opportunity to try to seize control of the e-file. The e-file is the main artery to his position. How do we do that right because one rook defends the other, but we have the move? Rookie five, the rook gets onto a defended square, it's like a checkpoint and our idea is to double hooks. Now. You guys might look at this and say well wait a second. He can go bishop f4. I know people are thinking this, but if he goes bishop f4, then the rook can reposition to f5. That does give up the e file. That is true, but it puts a lot of pressure on his bishop and by extension, on his pawn on f2. What I'm trying to do here is unbalance the position trying to get some intrigue going, some tactics so that he has to calculate now. He has a decision to make, which is a good thing in blitz, he's going to burn some clock decides to take. Of course we take with the queen now this is on our is under under our control. Talking too fast. What should we do now? Where should we put our queen? We have several good options: several good options, let's complete that five thousand same idea as workout five pressuring f2 now look at this bishop. What can you guys tell me about it? It's a what what what it's a type? What what and what should we do here? So we can just drop our bishop back right. He can't take on c7 because it's a type type, two undefended piece, which means we need to notice that bishop and start calculating tactics in relation to it. Uh. That also means the queen is tied down and if we attack the queen, it's going to have a very, very hard time keeping the bishop protected, which is why he drops it back now. We need to start playing aggressively here, which often means sacrificing something. So I have a very interesting idea in mind: what yeah rookie 8 now we're sacrificing a pawn in order to grab control of e file, but I have made a judgment call. The judgment call is that seizing control of the file is so important that it is actually worth giving up the c7 over and potentially even more pawns. I also have a tactical idea after queen takes c7 he's deciding whether to capture I can see the wheels turning in his head. Okay. Now let me explain this idea: what is our top wish list item? What would be like the ideal scenario here? Wait, not rookie 2 because of rook f1. Let me let me kind of justify it. So the wishlist scenario is checkmate on e1. We want to get the queen to e1. If we go queen e4, we telegraph the pass right. He can go h3. So can we set up a situation where we can simultaneously threaten checkmate in something else? The move is h4 now he has to take. I think otherwise he loses f2. With main, we get the bishop on a type one on defended square, and then we fork it by playing queen e4 there's complications there. He can try to defend the bishop and made against at the same time, but that creates other weaknesses. Then we threaten the bishop. That's it that's the whole logic. This is not that complicated. I think h4 is a really really strong move. That's what I saw when I sacked the pawn. I'm sure there were other ideas here and I think he probably has some sort of a defensive resource, but we'll see if he finds something right. So bishop takes d6, don't forget why we played queen f5 in the first place. Don't forget that we're x-raying that pawn and he's paying the price for that now that pawn is gonna, be unattended, and if we take it, we can then get a rook or a queen to e1. That's a sexy move yeah, I think he's okay. So I saw this too, and this is a very strong defensive idea. He wants to play. Hg queen takes a7 that queen is guarding f2. So how do we need to think about the situation? Well, we need to first of all, we still have the idea of bringing the queen t1. We cannot go queen e4 because he trades queens, but um we can uh. What can we do here? What what are our options? Well, we can play queen take c2, but then he takes a7. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go queen e6, I'm gonna go queen e6 I'll, explain, type, 1 and type 2 guys, but you have to let me you have to understand that there are people joining the stream or new. Oh, my god, he defended. He found a way to defend amazing, because rookie 70s got a check all right, I'm gonna have to take okay. This is bad, but there's the good news. The good news is his king is still very weak uh, which gives us hope, but in general uh we're fighting for a draw. Now we're gonna snag off one of his pawns. He actually found a brilliant offensive idea here, we'll talk about it after the game. For now we have to defend we're going to be down upon at the end of the day, which is fine, because his king is still quite weak. Our pieces are very active and we're only down upon and he's got a weak pawn in a4, but I don't want to trade queens if we want to keep winning chances alive, we need to activate our pieces asap. How do we do that? How do we activate our work? Where do we put it? What is so brilliant about rook? Well, nuke. I think it's a nice move, I'm sorry if it was very obvious. So, first of all, let's yeah rookie five is correct. Okay, now we're gonna lift the rook up. We're gonna, lift the rook up thread, checkmate, okay, we're going to thread and check, and now what? What do we do now he's weak in the diagonal? How do we exploit it quickly? Help me out heroes? How do we exploit it boom and he has to go f3, but now, let's snag the pawn intermediate move, snagging the pawn making sure the material is equal. Now, let's go in for the let's go in for the kill, queenie two threats checkmate: it threatens a lot of checks. We're gonna, take here, we're threatening checkmate again, king h7, I don't see a defense and he's lost. He has to give the queen up boom goes the dynamite. Thank you, brett toad for the prime, so we won in the end, but that was a very back and forth game, but it was a really interesting game. So in the four nights, defense knight, e4, so type 1 and type 2 undefended pieces, guys type 1 undefended by anything type, 2 defended only by exactly one piece. So he plays this line with e5. One of the main lines here is bishop back to c4. You don't really want to give that bishop up, but he goes for this very drawish line. Where there's a lot of trades, we develop our bishop castle castle, bishop d3 and somewhere. Here I made a mistake: I'm not sure exactly what the theory is here, but um. I think it's somewhere here. Ah, so I think here I shouldn't have played queen uh. Actually, this is fine, but hero. G6 was a mistake. G6 was a mistake. What should I have done? Instead? H6 is correct and um. We stop bishop g5 and we defend against mate. I just didn't realize that the holes I'm making on the king's side are significant. I forgot about this move and actually this move happens whatever we do, I can't defend against bishop g5, which brings us into a very nasty situation now. If we just pretend that nothing's happening, he gets the bishop here and he clamps down and look how passive this is. He can bring the rook to e1. He's got lobster pincer ideas. I didn't want to allow this to happen now, one second, okay. So, basically, if we go rookie six to try to defend against the f6 square, then bishop c4, okay and uh, we have to bring our rook back. So we have to allow it, but I did that by setting up the h6 square for our queen, so we at least keep some pieces. Active a4 a6 again a5 would have weakened the square and also I wanted to lure him into going b4 so that he weakens these squares right. So bishop b6 takes and rookie five now the battle revolves around the e file battle starts revolving around the evo who can get control of the e file. If he goes bishop f4, I can reposition to the file. You have to be flexible. He takes, and in this position I have a choice. I can maintain my control over the e-file. How can I do that? If I wanted to maintain control over the e-fund? Where should I put my queen yeah? I should have put it not only to have learners to queen, not queen, e6 guys, because then he takes and he gets control of the, but on e7 you shouldn't be afraid to make retreating moves at various wins. Then I can go, but I wanted to play more adventurously, so we got queen f5 uh, trying to exploit the weakness that I have to also I'm attacking c2 okay. So this is where I made the judgment, call to sacrifice on c7 and in retrospect that might have been wrong, so I could have gone c6 here and defended it. He cannot take on d6 because f2 drops. Perhaps I could have done that um and instead I decided to stack the pawn so here. Let me unpack for a second, the idea of h4, so h4 basically tries to lure his bishop onto an undefended square if we go queen e4 immediately. Sorry, that is what I compare this to is telegraphing the pass in basketball. That's like holding the basketball over your head and looking at your the person you're going to pass the ball to well. The opposing team is going to see in football. That's the thing is going to see who you want to pass it to and he can prevent the man with h4. So instead we lure the bishop onto h4 and then we're going to go with 84, and this creates a fork against these two pieces. If he goes g3, he weakens his control over f2. We can slide our queen into f3, okay um, and I think this creates very, very big threat. I'm not sure this is winning. It creates big threats against skin black has a pretty strong attack. Uh donations. We got a donation, I'm sorry I I might have missed it. Oh one dollar from bracket boy. Thank you! So much sorry. I missed that donut one dollar from bracket boy um, but yeah. I try to read donations when possible, because I have the alerts on okay, so queen f3 would have been very strong, but instead, what did I blunder queen takes b7 is super strong fable. Thank you for the spawn. If hg he goes queen takes a7 and simultaneously defends f2. This is what I missed. So I decided to go queen e6 sticking to my old idea, but now rook f1 is super strong. He gets the rook onto f1 so that this move is no longer check and he doesn't have to take my queen. He can just take the bishop, for example, okay, and what I decided to do and at the end of the day, uh I'm in trouble at the end of the damn troll, because if I now move my bishop back, maybe this was correct. Actually, but then he plays bishop takes h4 and I can no longer get the queen onto e4. The great thing about this move isn't that it only takes the pawn. It also brings the e4 square under control. So look for these kinds of intermediate moves, okay, so rock f1. I acquiesced to a bad position, but at least black has peace activity and return for the plot. I think winning this would be really hard. I actually think black's drawing chances outweigh white's winning chances activating the rook- and here he made a very big mistake. How should he have defended the pawn on g2 without weakening his king side? Not a not a pretty move, but I think that g3 set him up for trouble. So there's two possibilities here that would have both been better than g3. The first is f3, which at least is not as bad, but I think windage would be the most circumspect. It is true I can take his pawns now, but it's a draw g3 set him up for trouble because now he has all of these weaknesses, and this is so hard to defend in a blitz game. I'm pretty sure you can still make a draw, but in a blitz game these kinds of positions are super hard to defend, because it's a it's a king weakness, okay, um, so that basically won the game very back and forth very well played by my opponent, which is awesome. My opponents are putting up a great fight and we're almost at 2200, so we're 300 points away from the conclusion of the speed run. It's been an amazing ride so far, but I think I'm going to stop for today. Here I've got a lot of work to do guys unless there's serious objections um. I think this might be a good good time to pause for the evening rent crow. Thank you for the prom skis. Thank you for the prime. I see people trying to bribe me. 245 from luki there's objections, objection your honor yeah. Just give me a second. Let me let me sip some water yeah. The thing is guys. This does take a lot of energy. You know I'm trying to really every move, I'm trying to engage in the position and uh. Oh here, come the brevis happy pineapple double! Oh seven, five gifted fair enough! Okay, we'll do an encore one more we'll do one more five, three six one! That's a great number! We'll do one last one guys uh just give me a second to compose myself. Yeah you're, very welcome thanks, happy pineapple double007 gifted five appreciate it very much: okay, um! Oh my god! Here we go to seeb's, matching it five gifted as well. This man is on a tear today. Tess seems thank you for the five gifted um. No, I'm not trying to elicit people's like sympathy. I I really enjoy this. This is a lot of fun but uh. This is awesome. Okay, um! So let's go into the pool. I think I'm good now have a little coffee compose myself get my wish back holy smokes. That's awesome, julian! All right! Um, let's play one last one guys hey guys: this is john okay. Now everything is going to be up on youtube. Oh thank you! Uh mad, knocks my man. Oh, I might have missed it. Sorry madness! I'm really sorry I'll! Look back at it! Okay! So let's go back to the sit sil. Actually, let's play malachi now. So a lot of people wanted me to play a jeep ribbik. Another sub wanted me to play an alakan. I will respond now this position we can take the knight the issue with taking the knight is that he can take with the d-pawn and he accelerates the pace of his development. So what we're going to do is we're going to drop the knight back to b6 and we're going to come we're going to control the center ourselves either with d5, but the alakan is what kind of opening fill in the blank now we need to go 85 to stop it from doing that and who can summarize to me the sort of fundamental logic behind these types of openings. It's called a hyper modern opening, the hyper modern, it's not about it's, not about controlling the center, with as many pawns as possible. It's about making sure that you can attack your opponent's center of the species. You want to provoke your opponent into controlling a lot of the center julian berman. Thank you. So we can't go d6. That was the point of his move. Now, what should we do unless he doesn't control the center, then we can actually. Finally, you know we can. We can make a claim to the center, but let's actually go so knight c6. He would have d4 and I want to keep the c file. Let's go. Let's actually go c6, let's get the bishop out and and let's go d5, so our opponent has decided not to control the center at all. So we have nothing to attack so again, flexibility, flexibility, flexibility, uh in any opening. You want to have the idea of changing your strategy. If your opponent does something weird, you can't put your head down and always do the same thing every time people get into trouble. Because of that, how should we go about developing this bishop without obstructing this bishop? If we play bishop g4, he can start chasing our bishop around yeah we fianchetto and we attack e5 good job bishop g4. He would play h3 that would be kind of an empty pen. Okay, so he's gonna fianchetto his own bishop, let's, let's castle, let's complete our development. Now, let's take a look at this knight: let's take a good hard look: ooh, h4, okay, now action on the flanks, as we know from a very important principle, is oftentimes met with action in the center. What does that mean? How do we ensure active development of this knight, bingo c5 knight c6? Now, why are we putting the knight on c6 it's more active if we go knight d7, we block our own bishop and we potentially can consider c4 pressuring his position that doesn't trap the bishop because he can play bc and get the bishop to e4. So we need to be careful about that. One second, okay, so knight c6, attacking e5, knight, c6 attacking e5 and then uh if knight f3. What now are we going to do thanks again guys for all of the support and the engagement most of everybody being engaged, makes this better and uh yeah? This is awesome. Okay, so bishop g4 is correct. Now we pin him because the spin is a very specific purpose. We are trying to win the e5 pawn. Now, let's unpack the situation, we have many good moves here. There's many approaches to the position. He cannot push the pawn because his bishop is type 1. How do we apply pressure on this pawn? How do we apply pressure on the c5, and that would be the most consistent strategy? We can also go night before we can consider c4 there's a lot of possible moves here, but let's keep things consistent with our general approach, which is to win that central pawn. Thank you, dovah 7., and you know this is annoying because it's hard to defend against consistency, appreciated nova, 7 priming uh, but we shouldn't necessarily play bishop f3 bishop e5, so we can win the pawn. We can play bishop f3 and bishop e5, but there's a little bit of complication there. So, let's, let's do it. We also have to be careful our king's side. Okay, which way should we take the pawn very, very important? Which way should we take the pawn so not bishop takes because of knight takes d5. We should take it with a knight to attack his queen. If we had taken with a bishop, we would have allowed knight takes d5 now we attack a screen and believe it or not, there's something I missed here and yes, I do miss tactical details. Occasionally he actually can still play knight takes d5 because it attacks my queen uh, and that leads to a very interesting and very complicated situation. I think he's calculating this. I I will still be better uh because we will be able to move our queen away and force him to take his night to take my night with his bishop weakening his own king I'll explain that situation if he takes on d5. That's not an easy thing to see, because a lot of people would automatically bring their queen back or take on e5, which would be even worse because we could checkmate him, but we will see if he finds it yeah. So you just got to be attentive to this stuff and that's a mentality. That's a mindset, in my opinion, that's a mindset of not taking things for granted and always questioning your opponent. He doesn't now what's the issue, the issue is twitch, let's go! Thank you. Divina rating 51 appreciate it we're attacking we're doing the speedrun attacking the queen and attacking the knight. Does that make sense guys if he moves the queen? We take his knight if he moves his knight we take the queen, so he has to take on e5 now, which way do we take? I just gave it away. Doesn't queen take c5 blunder, knight takes b6 same mentality, we don't take things for granted. We don't assume anything about what we have to do. We consider all the options. No, because a checkmate he's got to drop his knight back. Amazingly, he holds on now. We have an opportunity we need to strike. We need to strike while the iron is high. What does it mean to strike in such a situation? Couple of things to notice number one knight is tied down. If the knight moves he gets checkmated boom. We need to open up files for our pieces and notice that I'm making this move without calculating. I just want to open stuff off. It's only sacrificing a pawn, it's not a big deal and we're opening up the c file, and if he takes of the pawn, then we can actually play knight takes a4. Oh, that is a very bad one. That is panic, but let's be logical in our thinking. The knight is hanging. Can we defend the knight with tempo and then win the bishop yeah simple move rook a b8 queen has to move and then cd, so he might trade queens here, but we're gonna be up a piece once again. Excuse me transforming our advantage yeah. That was panic, but he was already in big trouble. Okay, so he's creative, but uh, but this is not good enough. So actually here, if we want to play for maximum, what he's allowed us to do is an opportunity- let's not rush with taking the queen. I know a lot of people want to take and take, but we can just move our queen to c5, because the situation remains his queen is attacked and now, in addition to everything else, our queen has access to the a3 square. In fact, I'm telling you guys we might not even need to take the bishop. We might checkmate him even without that that was impulsive, but it was also panicky, and I understand why so well, just in case I'm putting out one video today. My editor is working very hard. As you know, I have a lot of things. I'm up. I'm up to so it takes time now actually, who, with a keen tactical eye, can find the wind here forget the bishop. We have a better move. Remember that you're that his knight is tied down. Well, we are speedrunning the editing believe it or not. It's harder than it seems bingo good job, guys, knight is tied down. Pawn is pinned queen, be too threatened. He's made it in one simple, effective and strong, and we didn't even need to take the bishop. That is why you don't rush, because you find things out about the position when you take your time when you look at the whole board, all right, good game, we're gonna, go over the game, then we're gonna pause for today. I know a lot of people. People like to bribe me, but I you know this is gonna, be the last game. I still appreciate the bribes so okay again make it look easy. Well I mean that's the point: hey harry shadow gets the sale all right so 21.99. I know what people thinking the alakan now knight c3 is a move, but here bishop b5 was weird. I mean he starts to. He starts to just move his pieces around. He should have gone d4 and then we go d6, and this is sort of a main line of the allagan wolfie encounter the bishop. We will attack e5 we're trying to get him to take on d6 to give us more freedom. White is slightly better in these positions, but it's interesting. We've played this before so. Bishop d3 is a bad move for the very elementary reason that it obstructs the bun. I think he already at this point had the idea of fianchettoing, but it's just janky d5. He could have unpassanted us, but then we would have taken and developed our bishop to e7 and then castle black is completely fine. I think he should have done that, though he goes 92 and now g6 fianchetto in the bishop. There should be two castles h4 he starts attacking, so the principle dictates that uh, when our opponent is playing on the flank the g moses. Another thousand, thank you appreciate it. When our opponent plays on the flank, he takes his attention off from the center, so we should do something in the center um and I can show you guys a lot of instantiations of this principle in complicated positions. This is something that applies at a grand master level um. I have a couple favorite games that really illustrate this concept. Um and sometimes cole, drobo think for the prime. You know sometimes playing the center involves doing something. A little crazy, sometimes striking in the center involves sacrificing. So let me show you guys very quickly. This is complicated, but I won't delve into any of the complications. Uh korchnoy against luke mcshane british player very strong, and this position court schneider is h4, so luke mcshane takes on d5 and what seemingly crazy move? Do you think he plays by the way? I want you guys to notice the x-ray that is going to be important boom e5 ripping open the position and the reason he does that is, that white is not developed enough on the king side. Now the point is: if f takes c5 and knight c6 is a beautiful move using the x-ray, and if bishop takes b6, then black has a humongous attack in return for the peace and um. This is just scratching, and if bishop takes c5, then we have that e-file machine didn't end up playing rookie 8, but now we use the bishop to accelerate our development and black gets a big initiative. Mcshane won the game, so there's there's there's many details there, but I just wanted to show you guys. This does actually is, is applicable, the grand master level very much so um. So remember that so c5 now knight f4, I think, is a very expensive waste of time. You should have probably gone h5, but now he gets in big trouble because his e5 pawn is indefensible. We pressure it. Now we play bishop takes f3 and bit knight takes e5. If bishop takes e5, he plays knight takes d5. Some of you might think. Oh wait a minute. We fork his king, a knight, but he can just drop the knight back. It's very important for us to keep the bishop, because this bishop is the main attacker, as you guys saw in the game, 965 good job by my opponent, but it doesn't actually really help because of this, and now c4 opening up the position. If b takes c4, what would we have done? Well, I understand his panic because he's on the cusp of getting checkmated yeah knight a4 is very simple, so he plays bish queen b7, but if bishop takes c4, then we'd go knight c4 and we could go queen c5 where we go. Rook cnn there's a lot of moves here that end up with the same results and uh. This is just pretty crushing, so he goes queen takes b7 and after rook ab8 f4, queen c5, we don't even need to play. Rook takes b7 and cd, so this is just winning queen. A3 knight takes a4 and queen a1 is checkmate and um. That's just a very simple attack. We didn't even have to take the bishop, so this is just winning yeah 1pm tomorrow bullet championship, so that basically was again. It was the speedrun we're almost at 2200.
