[Music] well, thank you so much anu and we're gonna go e45. We're gonna play classical style of chess um and uh. Let's go knight c6 all right. So let's play the four knights defense. This is one of the most common openings at this level and um. By the way, I will leave time at the very end of the speed run for random questions. I will not make detours to answer opening questions. He plays the four night scotch, so he opens up the center. This is an opening that I recommend to a lot of beginners because it opens up the center and it and it basically gives diagonals for both pieces. So taking a look at this bishop, where can you guys propose that we put this bishop but not, but to develop actively and to develop a tempo? Where can we put this bishop? There's two good moves. There's two good moves: c5 is one which we're going to play and b4 is the other. These are the two main moves. I play bishop c5 myself at a grand master level. Bishop b4 is the most popular move. Okay, he's gone. Bishop e3 now alert alert, alert alert. He wants to take our knight and when we take back, he takes our bishop. Our bishop is undefended. Can we move this bishop onto a square where it is defended? Can we drop this bishop somewhere, where it is defended yeah there should be six, that's the main move. This is the main line. Actually, queen f3 alerts a little bit. What has he done? What has he done? What has he done? He has confused something he has hung his knight two attackers, one defender boom. That's it I'll, explain: um I'll, explain the subtleties of the move, bishop e6 after the game. Okay, so he actually is helping us by training um. I'm writing all this down. Okay, so he's gone queen g3. Now we already know how to respond in such situations. We do not get intimidated by a single queen. How do we? How do we proceed? No reason to take the knife we castle, beautiful guys, there's no reason to take the night. Yet if he castles, okay, now he's attacking our bishop now it makes sense to take the knight- and not only does it make sense to trade here, but it makes sense to do what in this position, this comes back to the principle that we do not take pieces at random, but if there is a pawn or a piece, that's just hanging there and we don't damage our position by taking it. We take it now. It's going to be very important here, guys to develop the rest of our queen side. We don't want to spend forever with these pieces and we actually have a really high level move here. It's a move that might be a little bit difficult for some of you guys to understand. Dornev got it now. We can drop the knight back and then play d6, but can we kill two birds with one son, amazing, I'm actually very impressed. We can play the move d5 now this move has two purposes. The first is to protect the knight. The second is to open up a path for the bishop. Now you guys might say, but daniel wait a sec. Can he take the pawn well that leads to a trait of queens and a pawn is a very small price to pay to trade queens, particularly since f2 would be hanging at the end of the line and I'll show that later? Okay, what do we do now? We cannot take because the queen is defending. What's a good move here, guys, bishop f5, very good morrigan is on fire getting the bishop out and protecting the knight. Now he could play f3 and chase the knight away, and then we would have to be very careful. He goes queen g5 um. So let's uh, let's defend this bishop, shall we, let's, let's uh, make this bishop secure? How can we do that? No need for queen g5 check. Let's just go bishop g6 now if he takes on e4. What are we going to take back with if we take on okay he's got here, and this is a great opportunity for us to trade some pieces. There is a great opportunity for us to trade some pieces here, particularly since he's got very active pieces. Okay. So when your opponent has active pieces like this, no need to go pawn, hunting no need to go pawn hunting, let's trade queens, how do we trade queens? I want to trade queens, though I want to show you guys how to win. When you decide to trade pieces, czechovich, chaka ruski's, we trade queens, we take it, but daniel you're blundering upon again. It doesn't matter because we're up a piece, but he doesn't even take it. He goes bishop e5. How do we protect the spawn in the best possible way? How do we protect the spawn in the best possible way? C6 is beautiful and then we need to find a way to continue now in such situations. Okay, well, thank you very much for the bishop see think he's mikhail tal or something. What do we do? All we need to do now is just bring our pieces in and trade pieces we've decided to trade pieces. So let's continue with that particular strategy. How do we bring pieces in and trade pieces at the same time, rook f to e8, offering a rook trade? Thank you very much, and now we have what's called an open file, but before we do anything, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take care of my future self. I don't want any problems with my back rank, so why don't we take a second and create a hole for the king? I know that rookie 2 would be better, but I want to show you guys how to play with an abundance of caution. Now we can penetrate the second rank. Okay, always do this now, let's start taking pawns, I'm going to play a little bit faster here, because uh we have a minute now, here's the thing: how are we going to actually win this position? A lot of people would continue to take odds, but we are already up to pieces guys. We don't need to keep taking pods how you win. Such positions is by identifying a passed upon and pushing it to promotion. What is the past pawn that we want to push here? What is the most far advanced and in fact the only pass bond we have, but we need to get the shortcut of the way. First, we don't play c5 because we dropped the pawn. How do we get the rook out? Get this goddamn rook out of d4 96 is perfect. We don't worry guys. Remember I. I am pretty good at bullets. So, oh, isn't it isn't it great that we played h6? How did I know that we'd one day need this? Well, fantastic! That's exactly why you play these moves. Okay, let's push! I don't care what he does. Our king is so safe here, it's as safe, as can be guess what the knight, okay, I'm just closing my eyes and pushing the pawn. He cannot stop the pawn, even if he could. We would do this, but we just take and uh. That's it! That's it queen and uh. We have checkmate in two moves. Could somebody please find the checkmate in two? Could somebody please find the checkmate in two that is correct and that is correct? Okay, all right guys, let's analyze now this is the scotch. So this is the four night scotch. Now a lot of people would say and I'll take everyone's questions. Please be patient. A lot of people say wait! A second you said that it was a bad idea to bring queens out in the opening, and generally it is, but there is one key exception when there is no knight on b8- and you can- you can rotate this. However, you want this. Queen is a lot better than usual, because there is no knight c6 possible. What about c5? Doesn't this attack the queen? Well, it does. But what is the drawback of the move? C5, this smooth c5 is a horrible positional move, and yet a lot of people play it because the queen can even come back to d1. That's not the best move, but I want you guys to tell me what this does to black's position. Look at this juice right here. Look at this beautiful juicy square that has been now created because the pawn cannot go back to c6. In addition, it weakens the d-pawn, it weakens the c pawn and there's one more thing. I want you guys to identify about the move c5 in terms of black's development. What does it actually make more difficult? What does it make more? It blocks the bishop. Now the bishop has to go to a very passive square, because the pawn is obstructing our own development. Okay, this is exactly what we practiced for. That is the reason why we develop our bishop. Bishop b4 is more popular. That is also perfectly legitimate, and now the main line goes take stakes, bishop d3! This is a theoretical line. I won't delve into it. I had this in one of my games. I played bishop c5 and here it's very, very important to always identify the hanging pieces. Bishop on c5 is undefended um. Now somebody could say: wait a second daniel. You talked about intermediate moves. Why can't we first take the bishop and only after he takes back, take the knight. Well, we could, except this is a botez gambit. This is a botez gambit. We have to watch our queen at all times and uh. So for that reason we protect our queen now. The main line here is queen d2. I've had this again. These are. These are lines that I have in my own games. Um. It's not like I'm playing special openings to condescend to you guys. I practice what I preach. I've had plenty of games that went exactly in this way, in fact right off the top of my head. I can remember one game I played recently uh, which continued uh precisely in this manner in a protested game watch this see the gm's. Do this gms do this stuff too um, and this is the main line. This game ended in a draw um, and so this is the main line: white castle's short and black white. Sorry, black castle shore, black white castles long, and we essentially get a situation where we have attacks on opposite sides of the board. That is a situation we have not talked about it. Yet it's advanced, but you guys can understand that generally here, black attacks on the queen side and white attacks on the king side- and these are some of the most exhilarating lines and positions in chess, because we have two attacks and either side is trying to make the other okay, but back to reality. Mom spaghetti back to reality. Um, queen f3 was the move that he played confusing with some other blinds and he hangs the knight and the rest is very simple. We castle takes knight blue cole. Thank you so much for the subway switch. I appreciate the support guys and um. He goes queen d4. Now. This is the move that I think some of you guys might have found a little bit puzzling uh, which is the move d5, um and um. Why do we play d5 again? I hope people understand jax. Thank you for the five months that, if he trades queens, not only can we recapture on f2, but even if we wouldn't be able to this would be very much worthwhile. We only give up a pawn and in return we're able to trade queens, okay, um. What else do I have to say about this? We could have dropped the knight back and gone d6, but this would have been a little bit slower. Could somebody explain to me why the move queen takes e4 would not win a piece because it's because of the pin- and this is actually something that you would have to pay very- very careful attention to yeah we're almost to let's get this to 2000 boys. This is close uh, but I appreciate all the support. It's not quinchify check, because the one thing that I haven't pointed out to you guys about the desperado situation is a danger of giving a check like this, because now I could remove my queen and defend against the check. At the same time, I could remove my queen and defend against check. At the same time. In fact, I could counter the check and count her attacker queen. This gets very complicated, but it's just very simple, because there's no more checks and we get our queen out or we trade queens. All we have to do guys is take the queen because at the end, if we count up the material, we have two rooks in white as one we are up a rook. Yes, we're not up a queen, but we're up a rook in the end game. So for that reason queen takes e4 would not have been possible, but if our rook wasn't on f8, we would have to be very attentive to things like that whenever there is an extra here's, the principle to remember whenever there is an x-ray between a rook and a queen, what is an x-ray, a situation where there's a rook on one side of the board and an opposing queen on the other and there's a bunch of pieces that are in the way you have to pay attention to that x-ray, because x-ray tactics are among the most easily and most often missed tactics on the chessboard, because you don't think that it's significant, but this x-ray is super super important. We want to be very careful about it. Okay, what about f5 instead of d5 well f5 would not have accomplished the task of also preparing to develop the bishop, so it also would have weakened the king. So this would have been fine, but not great okay, so we developed the bishop if he would have gone f3. Could somebody remind me where we need to move this knight? Where do we need to move this knight in order not to give up the bishop? We could also, by the way, give a check on g5 first and move it to f6, but no, we need to do that. Knight d6 defends the bishop and we are fine, remember guys. There are two ways of broadly speaking of winning a position when you are up a lot of material. That means a piece or more option. One is to use that extra piece and try to attack your opponent, because, by definition, if you have 11 men on the soccer field and your opponent has 10 it's easier to score a goal, the other option is to start trading and to trade queens to trade pieces, because at the end of the day, if you have only one piece and your opponent has zero, that's also very easy to win. Remember that I went into the intricacies of when one option is better than the other. Why am I choosing to trade and not try to attack in this position? Why am I choosing scenario two here? Could somebody explain to me conceptually conceptually? Why am I choosing the other option here? Trade, your pieces before you blunder them exactly bingo, because both things are protected and also white is very active. Look at white's pieces. They are all mobilized boom boom boom boom. I don't want to mess with that. Okay, if I am careless, why it's actually going to cause some damage here. So for that reason, my training pieces, I'm disarming white's position, I'm making his pieces less active and in general uh just I you know this is just going to be very easy and also because I have open files and I can use these open files to trade a bunch of pieces, including the rooks that is sort of the uh. The background explanation for why I chose to trade queens in this situation. Um knight takes f2 would have been possible, but pretty complicated, simplify the position and the rest is very simple. H6 everybody makes everybody understands, and here one of the you could take on g2 and take everything, but the fundamental way of winning such a position step. One identify pass pawn, a pass spawn is a pawn that has no pawns obstructing it now. The crucial thing to remember here guys a little bit of a course in the end game. Let's say we have the following position is the h-bond passed? Is the h-bond passed yes or no more again? I could have done either. It really doesn't matter, yes, because it can go all the way to promotion. The e-pawn is obviously not passed. What if we were to remove the h now the h1 is not passed. Is the e bond passed? Is the epon pass now? Is it passed nope very good you're not falling for it, because the f pawn is not on the same file, but it is stopping the e bond from progressing. But if we were to move this panel as well, then the e-pawn is passed because it can move all the way to promotion. Okay, that is the philosophy behind past fonts. It's important to just to have that distinction in mind, um, okay, so for that reason we identified the pass pawn and then we identified the obstruction to the past. But in this case it's the rook, this piece is called the blockader. This is the blockading piece, so we remove technically the blockading piece and we do not play c5, because that blunders the pawn and we just push that's all I'm doing is pushing the pawn and then we deliver the checkmate very, very simple, very straightforward, no rocket science. Obviously there is a lot more to it. There's different ways of winning positions like that, but this is the most classically minded. You just identify the pass bond and then you just eliminate the obstructions or you create pass bonds. Okay, if you don't have a pass bond, you can create one either by just taking a bunch of your opponent's pawns or by using your own pawns to orchestrate a breakthrough, for example. Here, if you wanted to create a pass pawn if, for example, the d-pawn was not passed, you could just like take a bunch of puns and now the fbi would be passed. That's also perfectly fine appreciate that dave hammett and let's play one more game, any other questions. Yeah, we did have a nice mate that was made in three. We also had rook takes a two eliminating the pawn and then mating him on the a file that was also possible. Why did we play bishop survivor bishop before if we go bishop b6 after bishop e3 we're just moving the same piece twice: fantastic question? Yes, we're moving the same piece twice, but this is a bit of an exception to the rule, because it's okay to move one piece twice: we're not moving all of the pieces twice and also this creates tension. A standoff between the two bishops aquila pointed out a great point: if white takes both pieces, what piece do we take back with and what do we gain by taking that piece? We take not with the c pawn we take toward the center and look at this. We open up the rook. So by doing nothing except recapturing, we have opened up the rook and given this rook prospect, while it stands on its initial square, okay, so that's another perk of going bishop b6. We have this kind of standoff and black benefits from the standoff if white releases the tension first, that is not white's. Best move white's best move is queen to 200 bits. Thank you so much. Okay. Last two questions. I have seen queen's gambit and I've talked about it yesterday. I know we'll talk about it again. Can you show how you would use the open a file? I don't know how to actually use the app, so you could use it if white castles block. If we have a scenario like this okay, take a look at this. Can we take on a2? Obviously, no we cannot, but can somebody propose a plan for getting this knight out of c3 and then guess what once we take on a2 it'll be devastating knight takes. C4 is the tactical method. We could sacrifice the knight and get the rook to a2. That would be very interesting because we're threatening checkmate, but the non-sacrificial way would be just to push the b-pawn to b4, get the knight out of the picture and take on a2 and that's how attacking plans begin. That is why open files or semi-open files, which this is this- is a semi-open file, which is which means that there is an opponent's pawn on that file or a piece or sorry just upon, but we get the defending pieces out of the way. Is there a consistent way to create past funds with pawn trades, yeah, there's pawn breakthroughs and I'll get into that later. Last question: why wouldn't you take with a c pawn over the a pawn? Is the benefit of opening the file greater, but I would argue dolphin that there is no benefit to taking with a c pawn there. There is just I mean I don't understand entirely why you would even take with a c pawn right. I guess you correct your pawn structure, but you also create a very big weak square here. Okay, normally you take toward the center. That is one of the key rules toward recapturing. That rule has a lot of exceptions. I could show you plenty of examples of taking away from the center. In fact, there are situations that I could show you, where a very strong player decides to ruin his pawn structure in order to do something such as open a file. So sometimes it is so important to open a file that you would actually you would actually ruin your pawn structure. That is a worthy price to pay for opening a file for one of your rooks and one of my favorite examples of that. Let me show you one moment: please is the game between okay? No, not here uh. Just please bear with me for a hot second guys, I'm trying to find this one particular game. I think mama yara was the one who did this, so I think definitely mom and dara was involved. Um yeah tiara was involved, I think, and he played I think. Maybe it was a rhonian mummy drop. It was a game in the goes in ah come on, come on, find the position just give me one more second guys. Please please thank you pretty, please it's a rogozin. I remember that was a rugosin and this is a really nice example. It is worth the wait. I promise it was worth the wait. If I don't find it with this search, then I won't include it at all, but I'll find it later all right now that was a different game. I was, I swear. There was carlson against mamidyarov, but I don't remember um for some reason. I can't remember exactly how this was done. Um it was a rhonian pram nick. Maybe it was a rhonian kramnik corolla neritsky, that was another game um and if not, I will just play the next game guys. I know I know I'm taking a while here, aronian, no aronia kramnik, no okay, guys I'll find it later. The bottom line is that white took on g3 with a pawn rather than taking on h3. I will find that game guys. If somebody knows what I'm talking about, maybe you can tell me who was playing for some reason. I can't can't find the exact uh games. I don't remember who was playing. I will find it. I promise that this game exists, but for the time being, since I have only 10 minutes left, let's play one more game off the instructive speedrun. You guys ready for this. You guys ready for this um. It was carlson mamidyarov, I can swear um or maybe carlson aronian, the carlson against cerrone, maybe mommy dyarv is simply in my imagination. Last search last search might have been carlson against aronian and then we will do some speedrunning. I found it. Yes, amazing, I'm really pumped right. Now I really pumped okay. I found it 100 subs charge for seeing this game okay, so the bottom line is in this position. This is what's called the rogozin variation and after knight takes g3 magnus made a crazy move. That was a novelty. This position had occurred, a million times and white always took h, takes g3 okay instead magnus carlsen plays the crazy f, takes g3 weakening his pawn opening his king, and he does all of this in order to open that f-file, because he thinks that one day he's gonna put a rook on f1 by castling and he's going to attack that pawn, which is exactly well. It doesn't end up happening. It doesn't end up happening because aronian sensing that castles the other way, but by and large, if mag, if aronian, had basically gone well, carlson could have castled and basically he could have gotten the apple long story short. It was a crazy move at the time how why would you do that? But he won the game, so you can see at the grand master level this kind of stuff occurs. Sometimes you want to ruin your pawn structure and open a file. Okay, let's continue the speed run [Music] you.
