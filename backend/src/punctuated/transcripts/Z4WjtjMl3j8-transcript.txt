Let's go: we are playing with the black pieces here. Let's um appreciate it guys. Now I've been playing the kings indian almost exclusively, but uh in this game. I want to play something a little bit different. I want to play something a little bit more solid and I want to show you guys how to play um how to play more solidly. Let's play the slav. Let's play the slav knight c6, the slob is a form of the queen's gamma declined where you don't take the pawn. Instead, you protect it with the c pawn, and now we accept it with d64. This is one variation of the slop. John marthamu likes this line. Now. What is the idea? Essentially the way to understand it? Is this white goes a4 to stop b5, so white's going to play e3 and he's going to recapture the pawn we shouldn't try to cling to that pawn rather than trying to cling to that pawn. What we should do is develop our pieces in as free and coordinated fashion as possible, which means, let's get the bishop outside the pawn chain. Remember don't go e6 here that bishop remains inside the pawn chain, let's get it outside the pawn chain and if we're keenly aware of what white does where does this bishop belong noticing by the way which weaknesses white has created with his last move? Where does this bishop belong bingo, and this is theory bishop, before exploiting the weakness created by f4 no rocket science here, we're making natural developing moves, and now we need to develop this knight d7 being the only available square, but I like this right, it's connecting to the other knight. This is still theory now. The main line here is queen e2 to prepare e4. Let's see if he knows it, there's many many moves here. Queen v3 also possible. I actually know this line fairly well use h3, which is a little bit of an empty move. Uh no need for us to modify our strategy. We can complete our development by castling and he goes 94. That was his idea. He is going to end up taking this bishop, but that's not a problem because he's wasted a bunch of moves on the taking of this bishop. Now here's an important question: should we leave the bishop on f5, or should we drop the bishop to g6? There is a very important logical chain that we need to apply here. We actually should leave the bishop on f5. Why you guys might say wait a second. What what are you saying? I can see why you lost to el shawn, I'm talking about nonsense, he's going to take on f5 he's going to ruin your pawn structure, but give this a little bit more thought. Um. Give this a little bit more thought: let's go knight v6 expanding a little bit once he takes on f5 and we take back our pawn on f5 is going to clamp down on his center. It's going to control the e4 square and we're going to create this very nice, pawn mass on the king side, where each pawn defends its neighbor we're going to go g6 and the f5 pawn is going to be defended. So essentially it's another form of clamping down at the cost of yes, slightly ruining our pawn structure, but ever so slightly. Just one pair of double pawns never really hurt anybody, and that is an inconsistent move because he's actually letting us trade bishops and his night gets misplaced. So he's wasting a lot of time here doing a whole lot of nothing. Now we should continue making marginal improvements to our position. The reason that the slav is not to everyone's liking is that, even if white plays in mediocre fashion, black is not going to have an immediate blow now. What is white threatening here? What I don't want to allow is the move a5. I don't want to. Let white pushes pawns a6 and introduce defects in our queen sets. What should we do? Yeah? We should play a5, because not only does it stop a5, it cements the bishop on kind of an outpost, it's not really in the center, but it's a good square. Now, let's think about what what do we want to do here? What and a lot of people struggle in a position like this, but um there's no need to struggle, because the default approach in a situation like this is to continue making marginal improvements to your position and one move that I really like. One move that I really like here. The fact is the queen is undefended. We can see here, malcolm. I actually love your move. C5, the bishop is on an outpost. I know this move looks a little awkward but remember his bishop is locked behind the pawn chain, so our pieces in a sense are more active than his, which means that opening up the position, even a little bit, should be in our favor uh and we're not doing anything dry, yeah, okay, so he put a knight on up was not a big deal. Now we're going to bring a rook into the game with rook c8. Why are we putting it on a closed file? Because I am assuming that eventually, we're probably going to take on d4 and the file is going to open up okay, so hopefully everything I'm doing is making sense now, which piece? Can we improve? Further, what should we do here? If we look at the queen? Does the queen have a nice place somewhere toward the center? It actually does yeah. We can go c4 here. That would be interesting. We can go knight, d5 yeah, so we can go queen d5. We can go 95, let's go queen d5, potentially preparing rook f2d8. We are increasing our pressure on the center. Our opponent is playing very well he's not doing anything terribly wrong, but I feel like he's starting to slip and in openings such as the slob. You make these marginal improvements. We take toward the center right, we take toward the center. We don't stick with the c pawn, because we want to maintain pressure on the d4 pawn speaking of maintaining pressure on the d4 pawn. What should we do now? Well, one thing that we can take a second to do is to take care of our back rank yeah. Let's go rook fda first, but at some point it might be a good idea to play g6 uh and ensure that our back rank is is not weak because he has already played h3. I don't want to give him that unfair advantage. Okay, so a5. How do I think of a move like this? A lot of people here would just want to move tonight, but wait a minute. What do you? What do I notice about this move? What I notice about this move is that it leaves the b5 knight undefended, if only we can exploit that, and we combine that with the observation that that queen on d3 is vulnerable, we can go c4 into intermediate, move, exposing the attack on the knight. That's why we put the queen on d5 and if he takes our knight from b6, evades capture and takes d4 intercepting white's queen's control of the knight he's his knight is going to be in big trouble here. He needs to respond very carefully to avoid losing a piece he needs to be very careful to avoid losing. He does have a way to do that. Let's see if he finds it he's still going to be in quite a bit of trouble. If he does that, but um, let's see yeah. This is a a pretty sexy move. Uh the album is pretty decent. Actually doesn't get enough love, I think it's a pretty good opening for certain players. Okay, so he hasn't found the best move, and now we can take the knight he takes r knight- and here it's very important- to be patient- don't just grab the pawn try to find the best intermediate move. First, how can we malcolm tucker, is absolutely right. Of course, this is kind of a no-brainer. We could have also taken the pawn, but then we would have had triple pawns on the people. Now we can take p6. We are up upon and we're basically winning here now. We just need to show good technique, let's not forget, to take care of our back rank, particularly since he's going to double. I don't want to have to deal with this crap at some point in the future. What's going to be our plan here? Well, what I'm annoyed by is this rook? So what we're going to do here and first of all, this knight- and this knight wants to swing to d3? That's a very good move, actually very good move, so let's get our queen somewhere civilized and how should we defend the spawn? We have to move knight to d5 if he goes e4 he weakens the d4 square. That's going to be fatal for him and um. What he should do is go rook halfway, one that requires a lot of maturity, though that requires a lot of maturity. Let's see if he doesn't I'm a little bit low on time. So if he goes through cafe one uh, this is actually not quite as easy to win, as I had initially anticipated. He's done a very good job defending this so far, but um maturity not in like the behavioral sense, although that too, and he does it- I'm going to go rook c7 in order to protect the seventh rank. I anticipate okay. So should we trade rooks? Should we trade rooks? Absolutely we should you guys are making the same mistake that I described right. It's not like a test question where you're like okay, this guy this stupid guy thinks this. Is he rights and the answer is always? No. I'm asking you not from that perspective: let's go b5 to chase the rook away and now what is our plan going to be here? I want somebody to describe the plan to me and to tell me how to accomplish this plan quickly. Our plan should be simplified, which means to trade off the second pair of rooks, and we should do that in the interest of time I'm going to start moving by going queen b6 and now we're going to go rook a7. Why are we trading the other pair of rooks, because once the rooks are gone from the board, it's going to be a lot easier for us to exploit that past pawn and now we're going to do that by trying to dislodge the queen from uh c2 we're gonna go queen to b2 and instead of going c2 we're gonna first take on f2 I'll delve into the reasons behind this after the game. Given that I'm a little low on time, I do want to play a little bit faster here and I will worry not. I will explain everything after the game. Basically, I'm I'm eliminating uh issues. So now we can go 94 and if he takes the knight, that's actually kind of a sexy move, uh we go c2 and the knight cannot stop the pawn and he resigns good game. Okay uh. That was a very that was a very good game. I mean he he did not fold over easily, and this is the reason why the slav is an acquired taste because, as you guys could see, even if white was playing kind of in meteor profession, we were very solid, but it's hard for black to win the game in one fell swoop very hard for black to win like the game immediately. If you know what I'm saying: okay, okay, so the slot so basically dc. The other move in this position is to play e6 by the way. This is called the semi-slav, and this creates like the pawn triangle. I think it's also called the triangle system and um. The drawback of this is that it it blocks in the bishop on c8, but this leads to some very, very complex lines. Like d takes, c4 is simpler and if white goes e4, then black goes b5. It's the it's hard to recover the pawn. That's why a4 is played in these positions um, so bishop f5, e3 e6 bishop takes c4 now bishop b4, I explained these moves right. We developed the bishop to the square that has been weakened by his move: a4 knight, bd7 h3, we castle, knight, h4 and now knight b6, so bishop d3 was poor. He should have gone bishop b3 and stuck to his plan. So just to recap, um. The fact of the matter is what are the drawbacks of this move? There are two: the first is we obviously double our pawns and, second of all, we do. You know his bishop gets a little bit more active, but on the flip side our pawn exerts tremendous control over the e4 square and in combination with the knight on t5, we could potentially really clamp down on him by putting our knights on these two squares. I hope that makes sense and also we can defend the pawn by playing g6. That's going to be generally speaking, black's main play. Does that make sense? I know that's not bad, so he goes bishop d3 um. No, I don't think you should trade bishops. Now we go a5 to samantha. Bishop uh spicy brings his knight back and now c5 opening up the center. Why do we open it up? Because our pieces are more active than our opponent's pieces? Okay, knight, b5, rook c8, so basically, okay, bishop d2, a lot of people here would trade the bishop uh and you know, that's a that's an instinct that people just have to remove right, because it's not a good idea to trade. The bishop, that's on an outpost for a bishop. That's on d2! That's like voluntarily! You know getting your dental filling removed like that. Bishop on, before an outpost also functions to uphold the weaknesses behind it right in a certain sense. You can think of it. As you know, it's like the taybridge collapse. You know one of my favorite gruesome will not favor. That's the wrong word, um, a very gruesome, historical event: the collapse of the tay bridge. It's a very interesting story in scotland in the 1870s um there was an architect I think his name was thomas buff and a scottish. I think this was edible or glasgow. I don't remember one of the scottish cities. They wanted to build a bridge, the tay bridge. They wanted it to be good, so they come to dr buff. And, let me let me actually get the name straight one sec. I think it's like bowser or something dundee dundee scotland. So let me get the name straight because I hate making stuff up so basically yeah. So sir thomas bausch, so they they come to sir thomas belch and they commissioned him to to build the bridge um that carries trains across the firth of tay between the city of dundee in a suburb. They wanted it to be good and he works on it and they build the bridge and then on um 28th of december 1879, there's a fierce storm that happens in dundee very fierce storm, huge wind, but the trains still run and tragically, because this guy slacked off and this guy didn't do his homework. Uh. There were certain architectural defects that he knew about and the bridge collapsed while it had a train on it literally, like the top half of the bridge collapsed and the train went right into the water and uh. This was a pretty famous historical event. Let's just say that guy did not have a good time and there's a famous photograph that was taken after the collapse um. It was a very famous photo that was taken after the collapse of the tay bridge, which looks like this. You can see that just like half of it is gone and that's where the train collapses, the water. This is like 1870s, um and uh yeah. The people unfortunately perished, so not to use that as a tool to explain the speed run, but to use that as a tool to explain the speed run. Think of the bishop on before, as the tay bridge, if you take on d2 and outposts in general, are like a bridge outposts, protect weaknesses that are left behind the outpost and if you give up the bishop, these pawns on a5 and c5, which looked really good, are now incredibly weak. Okay, sorry, that's a pretty out there analogy, but I really want to make this important point. You shouldn't have the default to like take a piece when it's when a trade is offered okay, so a new bridge was built and that bridge did not go live so queen d5 bishop takes before a takes before capturing toward the center keeping the pawn on c5 to pressure d4. Thank you. Rook f28, improving the rook and now a5 was the big mistake. This was the decisive mistake because it leaves the knight unprotected and he misses the tactic. What should white have done here? Probably just improved his own position with rookies, but I think white is fine. Here, it's a it's a game. Maybe black is a little bit a little bit better, but after a5 c4 the knight gets caught on the crossfire. The move queen e2 would have been superior to queen d2 uh. The reason why is that here we do not have the move c3. In fact the queen is pinned. So at least white preserves relative material balance. Um black is still better, though so queen d2, queen v5, now c3. We win the pawn and we get a huge protected passer now spicy played well here, but ultimately we trade rooks because we're up a pun and we have a passer when we have a pass pawn like this, we want to get the game into the end game and now the key idea b5 why we want to get the rook to a7. Why we want to trade rooks? Why do we want to trade rooks? As I just explained, we want to simplify, because past spawns are most important in the end game. That's exactly what we do now we get the queen to b2 dislodging the queen from c2 and now why didn't we play c2? Could somebody explain to me why this doesn't just promote the pawn it actually does, but um this leads to unnecessary complications. This is a good. This is an important point, so it's not knight d3, because then we just win the night. It's actually check and notice that black's queen is all of a sudden out of the game. That's like timor, gorillaps, going from my game and all of a sudden, it's very, I don't think it's possible to avoid perpetual. In fact, in many cases, if you watch end games, you can actually allow black to promote, and I actually think white might almost be winning here. White has this huge attack and black actually has no checks, despite the fact that he's got two queens so be careful about, assuming that the game is over when you promoted a second queen, be very careful about that, sometimes even with two queens, the king is relatively insulated against this, and black is actually losing here. I've confirmed it with a computer, so you know be careful about that. That's why we take on f2 so that this queen could bring itself back to f6, take care of the king first and now we can, with a single mind, ah spicy with 800 bits and we simply promote 94 by the way nice little detail of c2. Then he goes knight t3, stopping the plot, so knight e4, derails, his knight from c5, get it uh and if he had taken the knight we go c2 and we win the game. Okay, moving right along 200 bits. Thank you. Moriyam gm we're playing a gm okay. Now, let's play the modern uh. I've played this. I think, once before, I want to showcase how to play hyper, modern openings. Now this is the sort of cousin of the perk. It often transposes into the perk, and he plays bishop c4, okay, so uh in this position. We of course want to develop the knights uh yeah. What is wrong with this move, ladies and gentlemen, and maybe I should have done this against celshan trusted myself correct. You know practice what I preach. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the free pawn, no reason not to take it. He just uh auto-piloted it don't autopilot. When your opponent plays unusual openings, now very important to react accurately here. How should we react? What are the possibilities here? There are several good ways we can play d5 to cement the knight on the e4 square, and I actually quite like this move. Okay, we can build up a little pawn chain or we can cover with the bishop, but let's build up the pawn chain now. What should we do here? What would be in the spirit? Well, actually, okay, so here's where a lot of people would slip up a lot of people would be tempted, I think, to play bishop f5, but the problem with bishop f5 I called it is: why does this very nasty move knight to h4, okay and um, that knight attacks the bishop and the entire construction threatens to topple over? So let's invite harry nelson pillsbury, and let's let mr pillsbury do some talking. This is the pillsbury knight remember what I always say: pawns are the best defender of a piece when a pawn defends a piece that piece is very stable. Why can try to go f3 in the future, but guess what white's already castled so a move like f3 might end up in disaster. Do we take the knight? Do we have to do anything here at all just castle just develop same spirit? Okay, now we have a very good move. What am I saying here? I'm seeing the knight this is a type two undefended piece uh, which means that it's only protected by one piece. So what my brain immediately notices here is the fact that the queen x-rays, the knight, through the lens of the pawn, let's move that pawn out simultaneously occupying the center. That's the great thing about the pill. Oh thank you for the night. Okay, this guy is really not having his best day. He blunders the knight, but already white was basically lost, and that is the game. Okay. Well, that was a quickie. It won't take us long to analyze. So queen e2, here by the way is, is the main move um. As far as I know you, you do need to defend the pawn uh. That is not a bad idea, but uh our opponent yielded yield to that part. Now, the only really important moment here was this position. I'm sure bishop f5 was fine but uh. I was a little bit scared of the move, knight h4 guys. What's the problem here with black. Why is this even an issue? Well, the problem is: let's say we castle right. He plays knight takes f5 yeah and we have to get this very nasty pawn structure. You might argue: well isn't this a pillsbury knight? Well, it is, but now we've given him like this h5 square for his queen, no need to to ruin our pawn structure like that. So knight, h4, is not a big issue. Um, but f5 is a more stable way to defend the knight, in my opinion, so knight g5, we simply castle. Obviously we don't take the knight that would defeat the whole purpose of putting it on e4. In fact, that would be very bad for black and if he goes f3 uh we actually just take on d4 with devastating consequences to the king. The funny thing is: if the king goes to f1, do we actually have to move the knight here? What would what would be black's best move, in other words, borrowing from the game. What you guys should see here is the fact that the rook is x-raying, the king, which means that the funny thing is he actually is not threatening the night. We can still go e5 as if nothing was going on, because if he takes he's literally going to get checkmated in the center of the board, that's literally what's going to happen. So this is a disaster he played c3 and now. E5 is a simple tactic: extending the attack on the knight. If he takes, we take with the f-pawn to open the f-file. We have a brilliant pawn mass and we're up upon horrible position for roy, but he at least should have done this after bishop takes c4. We of course also take with the f pawn. We don't take with a d-pawn cause that would also open up this diagonal. The h6 would be the same idea in spirit, but it wouldn't carry the the benefit of opening up the center and that's what's important about that move. Is that does that make sense guys? Okay? So let me see here: okay, any questions how about d5 instead of d6, what if he tries to cement his knight on e5, it's a pretty weak square. Well, if he tries to cement his knight on e5, we can we can assail it with knight d7 right. We have plenty of pieces that are guarding that square. That's a great point, and we have to factor that when you play a move like f5, you absolutely have to factor in the fact that you're weakening, e5, right and um- that's just something you have to notice, but we notice it because we have plenty of pieces that are defending that square, so type one undefended piece right type. One undefended piece is a piece that is not defended by any other pieces or pawns. A defended piece is a piece that is defended by either a pawn or more than one pieces. Okay, we call that he's defended. Bishop on f4 would be a type one undefended piece. Nothing is defending it clear type, two undefended piece, a piece that is only protected by exactly one other piece and not a pawn right. So, for example, here um, I'm looking bishop on g7 is type one. Could you name a black piece? That is a type two undefended piece. I love el shawn, he's great he's a very, very nice guy and very classy, and you know rook on h8. Yes, now here's the thing guys not every night on v8. This idea loses its meaning, if you indiscriminately kind of point to every piece and think. Ah, this piece is important. You have to exercise your judgment in terms of identifying the type two undefended pieces that might be vulnerable, like the knight on v8 is not vulnerable. Well, it could be, but I would say the rook on eight shade is less vulnerable than the knight of the bishop right uh. The knight is made contact with the by the bishop. So by definition, or at least using our judgment, we can conclude that there it's more likely that there's going to be some sort of a tactic with the knight, then with the rook um. Well orpheus. Well, that's that's where it gets into the tricky bit right. If you're aware of the fact that you're making an undefended piece, that's already part of the process toward not blundering awareness, is very important in chess right blunders often happen because, precisely because we are unaware that a certain piece is vulnerable, so awareness will not always produce total lack of blunders. Nobody can eliminate blunders, but it's important. Let's move on.
