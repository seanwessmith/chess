I am currently rated. Let's see, I am currently rated 13.98, so we're up to a pretty high rating uh, and this is where it kind of starts getting more fun for certain players, [Music] and we're playing. I think our first 1500., okay, so uh in the last couple of games, we've been playing the sicilian accelerated dragon, which is where blackfian tattoo is the bishop, and I highly recommend the accelerated for people in the 12 1300 range, who are looking to learn a new opening uh, because it's it's rel, it's quite approachable, uh, it's easy to learn and it can give you very good positions if white doesn't know what to do so. This move c3 is already kind of a mistake because it it obstructs that square from the knight and now the knight will have no good square, so we should simply continue developing here. Obviously we can't take the pawn because there's two defenders- and I can't draw arrows and then two attackers, so let's just continue developing our pieces um and he goes f3 now. This is a very common mistake. We've seen several people go f3 in these kinds of positions. It looks okay because he defends the pawn, but we already know that this creates weaknesses around white's king that we can exploit in what way. How do we open up the center here? Another move that we've seen many times. Let me just open the window. How do we open up the center in order to exploit the weaknesses caused by this move? We go d5, we go d5, that's also the power of the sicilian. This move is often just very strong uh, because this square is nicely supported by what I drew four arrows, and none of them were the one that I wanted to draw. That's a new world record, okay, so d5 um, and he can't keep the center closed. He basically has to take, or he can take the knight we would take with the pawn okay. He tries to keep the center closed and I'll. Take this opportunity, wait what happened paragucci! Thank you for the sub okay, someone said something funny and I missed it. So in such a position, the concept of keeping the tension is incredibly important. A lot of players they sort of want to resolve the tension. If there's a lot of pieces hanging in the air, they want to always make sure that that tension is resolved and doesn't exist, but sometimes we can just continue developing and, at the end of the day, we're going to benefit. So we can actually win a pawn here, but I want to show this concept uh in this game and the move that we're going to play is just castles. Okay, we're not doing anything, we're just developing and we're letting our opponents be the one okay. So he also castles now it's time for us to win a pawn. How do we go about winning a pawn? There's two main captures here: we can play d, take c4 or knight takes d4. How do we decide which one should we do? Who can tell me? Thank you hit stick for the prime one of these captures wins a pawn. The other does not very good knight takes d4 wins upon d takes e4 would have allowed the intermediate move. Knight takes c6. Now we take on e4 exposing the attack on d4. Do we take on d4 immediately? We do not, because white's queen defends the pawn but hey, we played the accelerated dragon, and that is exactly why this bishop is incredibly strong. It comes into the game. In many positions, we've won a pawn, that's a pretty good start, but obviously that's not gonna win us the game. We need to continue developing our pieces. Uh, we haven't completed our development. We still have this bishop. Where can this bishop go only one square and that's e6, it can't go to d7. Queen b6 would have been a good move as well connecting the rooks that might be our next move. I'm anticipating, probably okay, queen c2, the move queen c2 is weird. It doesn't really accomplish anything. In fact, the queen is quite vulnerable on the square. Can we exploit that vulnerability through a targeted move? What can we do here? We can go rook c8 and we can attack the queen. That's always a good idea. We bring the rook into the game and we attack a queen. So we do it with tempo now it's time for us to deploy our other rook, but that's not possible, because well, that would be an illegal move. Rook fda is not possible because our queen is there. So our task, then, is to move the queen onto a square vacate that square for the rook, but we don't want to move the queen just anywhere, because the queen also fulfills the crucial duty of defending the bishop. So let's move it out of the d file that way. Rook d1 does not actually pin the bishop, so so this move contains a lot of benefits. In addition, it kind of attacks b2, okay, so bishop h6, we don't care because we wanted to do this anyway, rook, fda and now all of our pieces are in the game. Our rooks are in open files, our bishops aren't tremendous squares and our queen is in the game. When that happens, it's like there's a clicking. You know, there's a clicking, sound everything is clicked into place now, it's time to nurture the advantage and and find ways to tighten the screw. Then what does that mean? What do we do specifically here? There's a couple of ways to go about this position. One way is to improve pieces even further. The other way is to identify annoying pieces on our opponent's side and eliminate them, and this bishop on h6 kind of annoys me uh. It annoys me because it it limits the king, it creates attacking potential, and if we trade, that bishop, this bishop is kind of lame. Now what would be the best way to trade, the bishop, it would not actually be bishop to g7, because bishop to g7 allows his bishop to move along this diagonal. Bishop to e3 is the move that we're going to play the the second reason this move is good is because if he, when he takes the bishop, because he basically has no other choice we will take with a queen and that queen from b6 okay, he does have a choice. He can blunder his bishop uh, which is what he did now we got the best of all worlds. What I was going to say is that if he takes on e3, we take with the queen, our queen is incredibly well placed. It attacks the bishop on e2, it pressures the pawn on e4 and all around. It just exerts tremendous pressure in white's position, while also keeping a7 defended. That's the ideal role for the piece um and a lot of excuse me. Let me just take a sip of water, I'm losing my voice, so we could have also exchanged the queens with a move like queen c6. I was thinking about that now. A lot of people don't consider this kind of move because they feel like it weakens this diagonal subconsciously. Oh, my god, there's going to be a queen that lands on g7 with checkmate, but you want to be very realistic and you want to be very practical at this level and what that means is sometimes you want to make a move that makes you feel uncomfortable if it accomplishes a very specific aim and if you're, tactically, confident, then you're also going to be confident in your ability to to make these kinds of moves and and override your maybe intuitive instincts that are telling you something is wrong with the move. Uh so anyways we're we're going to take a closer look at the game afterward, but let's play another one, and then we're going gonna look at games in batches of two: that's just sparkling water: let's go e4 and uh. He plays the sicilian. Now. The opening that we're going to play here is the c3 sitillion, an opening that I also played in my childhood as we saw and he actually finds the correct response he strikes immediately in the center. The basic idea of the c3 sicilian is, of course, to play d4 you're, trying to control the center and you're trying to do so with pawns and you're trying to do so, while maintaining the general health of the position and what are the drawbacks, the c3 system. The first is that the c3 pawn obstructs, as we saw in the previous game, the knight- and the second, is that we spend some time moving our pawns. So our opponent does get a small lead in development which we need to remedy as early as possible. So let's try to remedy that by developing our own pieces. Okay, bishop g4, pins, uh, the knight on f3 and, as we already know, the best way to unpin is by developing our bishop with bishop b2. We'll talk about the trade, that's an important point, but we will talk about it. Okay, so here goes e6 now, one of the keys to understanding the elephant is also is understanding the knight on b1. Where can this knight on b1 go people look at the knight they think? Okay, it has to go to d2, but d2 is kind of lame because it blocks the bishop and on c1, but the knight actually has a very interesting maneuver uh that makes the alpine tick. Where else can the knight go go to a3? What is it doing on a3? Didn't you say, knights on the rim are grim. Well, they are, but that knight is heading to b5. He stops us, but b5 isn't the only square that I can go or c4, and now it's actually going to b6. So when you're looking at a piece remember, I talked about kinetic and potential energy you want to look about. You want to look at where it's ultimately going, not only where it's currently placed and that's a very important distinction, because sometimes you look at a piece and you just dismiss that piece is terrible, but it's actually, you know in the airport waiting for its connection flight to freaking, venice. Okay, this guy is playing well okay. How do we continue now believe it or not? We have a chance to increase the pressure here because he has not developed his king side. So if we can find a way to like attack, something he'll have a hard time defending it, because he just doesn't have the forces mobilized, he's moved his queen around queen a4 would be a good idea, but he has b5 covering it and forking archwing on the night, but you're very close bishop g5 also doesn't really accomplish anything, because the pin is not that dangerous but in my opinion, the only way to actually make a serious threat here is queen to b3. That's the move, we're going to play and again after the game, I'll explain this move more deeply, but now we're going to position this knight on e5 and look how far this knight has gone. It started from a3 and now it's nicely centralized on e5. So one of the reasons that we okay go c4, which is actually, I think, good for us. Let's keep, let's bring the queen back, and one thing that that he's been doing here is he's really over extending his pawns, uh and and we're going to exploit that with a very thematic move. First, let's eliminate that annoying bishop. Okay. Now, let's try to exploit this pawn chain now, when I say split this punching, I usually mean attacking the base of the pawn chain. Pawn on a6 cannot be attacked, b3 would be attacking the tip of the pawn chain that would be sort of a conceptual mistake. Let's go e4 to try to undermine this is what undermining is you attack the base of something it's like you remove the jenga uh and the whole it's been years since I played that game. This guy is actually really really good. He's, definitely well well well, over 1400, now, let's position the knight on g5 exposing the attack on his knight. Second idea of this move is to position the bishop on f3 on an open diagonal to attack the rook once that rook is attacked, it has to move away from the a-file look. What else is on the afl or rook r-rook will potentially be able to land on a6 exerting even more pressure on his position. Let's take it and open the file now. One thing that's important to understand this phrase: the threat is stronger than its execution. Sometimes you don't want to make a move. That looks tempting you want to sort of keep it in reserve. You want to keep it in reserve and you want to complete your development first so that we only play rook a6 when absolutely necessary. So let's deploy our other pieces, our rook, we castled and let's wait for a more appropriate moment for rook a6. Okay, he's attacking our pawn. Let's defend it yeah this guy is playing, I would say, like a 23 2400, I know so. Bishop f4 here would be a very good move. For example, not a 1400 level move: okay h694, he doesn't leave us a choice. Bishop takes c4 so right now we're just recapturing pieces and um. Let's see knight f6 okay f5 is is, is a mistake. Why is a f5 a mistake? Can somebody explain, in my opinion, of course, maybe I'm wrong, but why is this a positional at least a dubious move? Positionally is right, so it weakens the pawn on e6 and that pawn is very attackable. In fact, we've positioned our rook there now do you guys remember. I said the threat is stronger than its execution. There's a certain move. We did not play earlier because it wasn't that strong, it's time for that move. R-Rook is moving into c6 in order to try to break up the connection between his queen and his bishop. It's okay to lose well. This guy is uh very, very competitive, I'll I'll say that he's yeah he's extremely underrated. Knight f6 is a good move, and now we need to decide how to how to proceed, but we have a well. I think we have a fork. We actually have a fork. We have a fork and it's not the most clear cut of forks, but it is a fork that fork is bishop c6 working his pawn and his rook um. Now one moment: okay, so let's see what he does if he goes: rook b8, okay, we're going to take the pawnee. If he had done rook b8, we would have taken e6. Now we take this one. Remember I told you he weakened his pawn chain. Well, this is the result of it. We finally managed to exploit it. Maybe he's doing a speed run too. Then we'd be both doing speed runs he's making some really good moves and some not so good moves. Of course I might be wrong um, so we will see he also yeah again people play well, I mean that's just the state of affairs in chess knight to e4 he's centralizing his knight, okay. I don't like that. I find this knight to be quite annoying. Can we get rid of this knight? Can we get rid of this knight? I mean, can we, but, but don't even think about playing f3 without weakening all of these squares around our king bishop c6? Let's go back to c6 chasing the knight away and the move. F3 would just create a lot of weaknesses on the king side that that would be the issue primary issue with that move and um. I do have videos like this on youtube and plenty of them and I'm uploading more capablanca loves to lose exactly so. Let's see what he ends up doing, queenie 2 didn't really do much. Oh, I guess he wanted to attack. C4 yeah that would have been possible queen e2, would have been, would have been possible as well uh to attack the pawn on on c4. But I like this a little bit more because by taking the knight we can stabilize the situation now he's attacking f2. So let's defend that with bishop e3. Let's, let's defend the pawn of bishop e3 now bishop f4 would be a strong move on his end, trying to remove the defender and he doesn't so hmm. Let me think for a second. This guy is definitely making me think, let's bring the queen in. Let's, let's bring the cavalry in sometimes when our opponent is applying pressure. We want to bring as many defenders as possible into the game and um. Hopefully, this queen is going to lend enough support to the king in order to ward off the immediate threats. If he takes the bishop we can just take with the pawn. I realized that it could be scary to open up the f file when his rooks are doubled there, but, on the other hand, r rook defends f1 and the reality is he doesn't have any entry points. He can go to f2, but that doesn't really threaten anything. This is that emphasis I made on concreteness. This is the emphasis I made on not falling for the way that something looks and just assuming that it's dangerous, for example- and this is uh, I think, a very good position for us. Why not pick the pawn on e6? Well, that's our plan. That's our plan, but we don't have time for that. Yet we need to first attend to our king yeah rook on a6 is incredibly strong. It's like exerting this pressure on his position, he's also running short of time. Okay, don't rely too much on heuristics when you can calculate well, queen c, we can still probably take on e6 because we have two attackers and one defender. Okay, queen b7, is a good move. Let's take on e6 he's going to take on b2 and he's threatening queen f to check now that's an annoying threat, because that would win the rook. So let's move his his rook away. Let's sorry, let's move the king he's going to lose on time, he's going to lose on time again. He played extremely well by the way our last move sets up a little battery against the g7 pawn wow. That was a that was a tough game. I think I played quite well and uh can I can I check his accuracy sure I don't think it was absurdly high. Let me see 88.3 and ours was 87.7, so yeah I mean he played really well uh, but he made mistakes. So I just think this guy is super underrated and uh. I don't think he's up to anything. Yeah he's better than me exactly, but yeah more accurate than us, and I I'm actually like trying. You know I'm actually trying to find good moves. Thank you. Kanako. The squirrel for the friend appreciate the sub, so I don't know I mean yeah. He was playing defensively and he he found some obvious moves. He also found some good moves um, but it is what it is: uh anyways he he took a little bit too long, uh finding these moves. Okay, um! So let's go over the two games and then we will continue now. Basically, in this first game in the accelerated dragon, the move f3 is very typical. Uh I've seen several people actually do this precise thing they'll play c3 to support the knight and then they'll play f3 to support the pawn, and both of these moves are bad uh and, as I explained, the reason c3 is bad is because it takes the c3 square away from the knights, and that is that is just not good uh. You want to develop that knight to c3, so usually people just play knight, c3 and bishop e3 to defend the knight, and there is a checklist that you want to go through when you feel like one of your pieces is going to be attacked. There are several ways you can defend against an attack. One is to move a piece from a square, but that can be bad because that doesn't develop anything. But when we want to make sure of is that when you're defending a piece with a pawn you're, not also taking away crucial squares from your other pieces or you're, not weakening your position. So this is a form of tunnel vision at like a 1500 level, as you guys know, from my sessions with charlie, I've defined this term tunnel vision um to mean over emphasis on a particular factor of the position in that, like a beginner level, beginner beginner tunnel vision usually results in like a queen blunder. Like you, look at one side of the board and you'll forget about the other side of the board and blunder the queen. 1500S don't tend to do that, but what fifteen hundred's tend to do is they'll, make a move that has a very specific purpose, such as defending a pawn or a piece. They will forget that that move also contains very significant long-term drawbacks. How did I know to pull the trigger? Well because he played f3 and opened up his position. We go d5 here we just castle, and that can be the solution to a lot of problems. You don't need to force anything. I don't like the movie 5.. This is a move. A lot of people would play. Let me explain why exactly. I think this is a mistake. There are several reasons. The first is that it helps him untangle his pieces. It's actually a good thing for him to trade knights, because this knight on d4, as we saw in the game, is actually vulnerable. Second, is that it blocks the bishop. I hate this. I hate the fact that it blocks the bishop, because the bishop this position is is is the most important piece. So it's the same exact thing. You want to make sure that a move which seems tempting doesn't contain more drawbacks than strength, so we castle and now we take the pieces in the right order. If we had taken on e4 first, he could have taken the knight first, so always check for in between moves. Don't just assume that he's going to recapture the same piece or pawn, and now once he captures his knight defends the pawn safely so knight takes d4 is the reason it's the reason why we played this move and then this move opening up the attack on the pawn on d4. The rest is very simple: we take the pawn. We complete our development, we attack the queen, we bring our own queen out. We activate the rook now we trade his best piece, the concept of looking for your opponent's best piece and trading it uh is, I would say: well let me and okay if people are like taking notes or something you know. This is like my chest philosophy, so I can formulate positional chests right people hear the term. Thank you, calacas for the tier one. People hear the term positional chess and they freak out all traditional gm's jams, positional chess only for gms, but the reality is positional. Chess itself is a simpler concept than people realize and in my opinion, if I had to define positional chess in three separate concepts, they would be the following: one: improving the placement of your own pieces, two trading good pieces for bad pieces or bad pieces for good pieces, uh, either your bad piece for your opponent's, good piece or well. I guess that's the only good way to do it, but your opponent could also be trading his good piece for your his bad piece for your good piece and then the third method is uh, of course, provoking weaknesses, okay, provoking weaknesses in your opponent's territory. So improving provoking and trading. I think that these now this is not the extent of it, but these are the bases, the three bases of sort of positional chess and doing either of those things isn't that hard per se observing making the right observations that lead to those things, aren't necessarily that difficult and- and I think some people need to get over their fear of positional chess and start thinking like that. So let me give you an example of where things can get a little bit hard and people often hear the term positional chess and tactics overlap. What does that mean? What does it mean for positional chess and tactics to overlap, and why can that make something more difficult? Let me give a good example: before we move on to the speed run, and then we will look at the second game and then we will move on. So please give me a second because I also need to keep opening chess space and my game collection to be able to pull up uh pertinent examples from the games under this is from the under 16 or sorry under 14 world championship in vietnam. So men will be happy, I'm showing this game, and I won this game in the end, but but benjamin played a very instructive move here in the following position: okay, so we are taking the side of benjamin here, um and um. It is blocked to move in this position now, first of all, when you look at this end game uh, who is better here like what is the snapshot picture that you get? Who is and thank you, dealer citizens. Thank you guys for all the compliments. I really appreciate it this. This keeps me going and uh. This is awesome. So what exactly? Why is white? Better yeah white is better. What is better for two very specific for three very specific reasons: reason number one is the fact that black is a very bad backward pawn. This backward pawn can be attacked if white puts like. If I put my queen on f3 reason, number two, as many of you guys are pointing out, is the disparity in the position of the knights black's night is terrible. White's night is amazing. Does anybody see reason number three? This is a pretty nice question I'll. Give you guys a hint reason. Number three is related to the fact that this is an endgame there's, something you need to look for when you're in an end game, not really discovery, ideas, I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly it's, not the king placement white's king being open is something that is in black's favor, so outside passpon, yes, a couple of you guys are noticing this white has the idea potentially of creating the outside pass pawn. That is the pass pawn that is furthest from all the other pawns with the move. H4 potentially. Why would this be important? Because if we have a pawn end game, the side that could create the outside passer usually holds pretty big advantage, but black has a lot of problems on his hands and benjamin found the way to solve them black to play and make the most out of this difficult situation black to play and make the most out of this difficult situation. He found a very nice what I would call a positional tactic, and some of you are pointing it out already. I want to give people a moment to think about it, so the move f5 I can just play e takes f5, because my queen is also reinforcing the knight, so undermining the knight is a good idea, but that's not quite going to cut it. Yes, so, as many of you are pointing out, the move is 97.. Doesn't this blunder a knight it does not? This is where the tactical element comes in. I have to take, or he takes my knight check trading, the bad knight for the good night. Four king queen takes c7. We have a pawn, we have a queen end game and, in the queen end game. The fact that my king is very weak should give black enough to make a draw. I managed to win this game. I kind of finagled my way into creating a past pawn uh, but basically this is a very simple example of trading, a uh, bad piece for a good piece and uh. I can give you a million of these examples. This is positional chess. That's all there is to it it's not that complicated per se but uh. That's why it's very important to have this kind of practice. Now we had two donations that I failed to recognize, as I was talking hit, stick donated five dollars, saying incredibly informative, easily digestible lessons. I look forward to seeing more of your amazing content. Thank you. Thank you. So much and astro darwin donated ten dollars just a couple seconds ago. Thanks for doing this, this is the right speed, very happy to hear that, thanks to both of you for the uh for the incredible generosity uh, what if I had played 93 preserving the knights? Well, it's important to recognize that now, white's knight is no longer good and also I drop either of these pawns. So this is basically not a good thing. I can find if you guys want another good example. Let's just do one more example of this, because this is very important for a lot of people to kind of master the, I guess, the art of of sort of automatically detecting what your worst place pieces and then trading it for one of your opponents, better pieces or just improving it in general, and a lot of maneuvers can be demystified through the lens of positional thinking through the lens of these one of these three things. This is a position that I had when I was already at gm 2014 and in this position I had just won a piece, but my opponent attempted to win the piece back with the move, f6 and uh. In this position I found a very strong move, but this move is very hard to find unless you specifically try to understand the drawback of the move. F6 like when we look at the move f6, we understand its strengths because its strengths are very obvious. It forks the bishop in the night. Its drawbacks are much harder to sort of recognize, but you guys are on the money right now. People are on a roll I'll. Give you guys a couple seconds to think about this. Bishop e2 is correct. Very nice, bishop b2, basically going to c4 the move. F6 exposes the diagonal the queen and the king are on the same diagonal. Therefore, you should always be thinking about pins. If you have a bishop, my opponent has to cover this diagonal with e6. Let's apply the same thinking, I played bishop c4 queen d6. What is the drawback of the movie 6 very specifically, and how does white exploit it? What do we do in this position in order to keep the extra piece yeah, but I know like maybe I wouldn't see this in blitz either, but like now we're taking a closer look at these games, so hopefully people can start like thinking about this kind of stuff. So what is the drawback of the movie? Six yeah g4 is correct and you're just trapping the bishop, so e6 covers the bishop's escape route back to d7. The bishop is now trapped. I preserved my extra piece and my opponent resigned so very, very simple stuff, but this illustrates the importance- and I include this under the realm of positional chess, detecting the drawbacks of your opponent's move. Positional thinking the drawbacks are just more subtle. You know. A tactical drawback could be something like weakening the king. Positional drawback could be more subtle, such as exposing. I guess it's somewhere in between exposing a diagonal in which both the queen and the king are located. Okay, what if he didn't play e6? Well, there's just no other way to defend against bishop c4. If he plays king h8, then this is just absolutely crushing so anyways, let's go back to the speeder and we have one more game to quickly look at before we move on, and that is that very tightly contested game in the allopancillion. Thank you, binary, steen for the tier one. Now, basically, okay. So in the beginning we played the mainline allopin. Now my opponent correctly did not capture on d4, and this again relates to the concept of not of keeping the tension, because this now creates uh the c3 square for the knight. Therefore, you want to keep these pawns here so that my c3 pawn stops the knight from developing, and so the knight has to seek alternate arrangements which it does queen. Diet is theory and now the move queen b3. I want to explain this move and then I want to move on now. What is the purpose of provoking b5 and to explain this? I want to share another element of my chest philosophy, which is that uh people misunderstand the concept of pawns moving forward, so this might be a little bit. This might sound a little arrogant like. I know everything I know very little so take this with a grain of salt. My views might change, but basically, whenever someone moves a pawn by definition, weaknesses are created in the position, because pawns don't move backwards, so squares that were formally controlled by pawns are no longer controlled uh by by any piece. Oh, my this was the missing piece. This was the missing piece and he has arrived gem jam taco with 10 gifted subs. Oh my okay, I'm done I'm I'm walking away goodbye, guys, I'm spilling more tea and I'm walking away this 10 000 bits yeah the context. Gem jam look at the sub count earlier today we had, I don't even know how to explain the stream, and this was the missing piece. Oh, my 10 subs, followed by 10 000 bits. What is this 3160? This is. This is on thanks for the fats and gifts. Look at the sub look at the bit leaderboard and the the sub leaderboard. It's unbelievable! Unbelievable! Thank you. Thank you jam jim logic, gifted 150. This will not be my last speeder and I have a feeling it won't be. But before I was rudely interrupted by gem, jim um, I was just kidding. Thank you so much. I was sharing why b5 is a bad move, so I was saying that by definition, when you move upon you create weaknesses left behind like these squares, c6 is no longer controlled, but in addition the pawns themselves become more vulnerable. Okay and if you think about it, uh, if you're playing capture the flag, I love capture the flag um. I don't know about you guys. Okay, sorry, this makes me miss six capture the flag in sixth grade. That is one of the few games that I'm good at if you're playing capture the flag, you know those guys who always jump across the fence and then jump immediately back. I was one of those people um. You know you know what I'm talking about it's a bit of a abstruse reference, but you can think of chess as like a game of capture the flag. The moment you cross the horizon, you can be tart, you can be targeted by the opponent and the same goes for pawns as soon as the pawns move away from their from their starting positions. They become more vulnerable because it is more difficult to defend them with pieces. If you think about it, black could have gone queen c7 here and very easily protected the pawn he can protect it also even with rook a7. But if you fast forward to the move, a4 um, it's very difficult to protect this pawn. This pawn is outside the range of black's pieces and so like it's hard to just it's hard to support it, because now the rook on it is also hanging. The same goes for the c4 pawn. If we play b3, we undermine the pawn, and so this entire campaign was to provoke his pawns into moving forward. When people look at pawns moving forward, they assume. Oh, you know. The opponent is grabbing space like it's it's bad for us, but you should really be careful about how you understand uh the movement of puns, because oftentimes it creates more weaknesses uh than than then I guess, more harm than good is done. Okay, so nanuka is asking. Could we have taken c4 uh? We could have tried, but in this position I think, despite the fact that it is a fork, black can defend against both threats with knight bd7 um. So he should probably I mean I'm not sure where he made his exact mistakes. I think he should probably go queen c7 here. I think b5 actually wasn't inaccuracy, uh and well. The rest is pretty smooth. I mean knight g5, bishop f3, activating the bishop, and our moves are relatively intuitive. It's just that he played very well uh, but I think I largely outplayed him can't you take on v7 after queen c7 uh. Maybe I actually missed something. Let's see, oh, that's a great idea zazy, but it doesn't work because the bishop guards d6. So you wanted to do this. I think, but unfortunately, bishop takes d6 um and that's a great idea, though good tactical recognition. That means you're, you're you're, making progress. Maybe bishop f4 is actually interesting, distracting the queen and taking on you know maybe blackwise queen e4. This is complicated uh, but uh. Long story short. That is the reason that I played queen v3, sometimes provoking pawn moves is actually a really good thing. Okay, let's play a couple more and we're going to wrap up soon. I have to sleep pretty early if he goes queen c8 by the way there's knight p6, forking the queen and the rook [Music]. You.
