I was playing the u.s championship in 2000 uh. I think this was 14. on the rest day of the us championship, which is a day in which no games were played. It allows the players to catch their breath, usually in the middle of the tournament. There's usually some sort of get-together that's hosted, uh by one of the organizers, just to let the players chill a little bit and and in st louis next to the chess center, which I'm sure some of you have been there. There is a a big house, that's owned by rex, and that house is used to host. Sometimes the commentators, you know some people dignitaries who come to st louis, it's a big big. You know stately house uh and the sort of rest day party was held there and yasser was there playing blitz with maurice ashley um? And you know some of the players were there fabi was there, you know it's it's fun, you know it's intense, but it's fun we're all competing, but we're all trying to be friendly. Uh and you know, some drinks are served and it's very important during a tournament to be as healthy as you can possibly be. You know no shenanigans uh, but I allowed myself a a drink uh on the rest day, which is rare, but you know just one but yasser who is you know? I know that he's rooting for me and he always has been he's coming around 15 bucks from the crazy fool and he looks at me holding a cup and he's like and you know yasser is so chill he gets super intense he's like that's, that's not alcohol. Is it and and he's like dead serious and I get I get like so red and I'm like no that's just sprite uh, but but it was just funny that you know yasser is very chill, but I know he's he can be intense too, and I mean that in a very good way. Okay, let's get started uh. Let me get my notebook ready, so I can take notes and uh answer questions properly or should I shall I say properly: let's go e4 knight, f3, okay, but okay, maybe some italian. Some. Some italian chess very good, but okay, we can play fried liver, okay, but I think we will play simple chess. G3. Okay supports up one castle here very nice, but okay. This is boring chess, but it is very effective to illustrate the principles of chess. We go c3 now to prepare d4. This is typical theory. But, okay, I see ukraine. This is a typically named inaudible, okay, so this is uh. Let's get serious uh, I'm supposed to be instructive. People say I'm. I can be a good teacher, so I so I gotta I gotta hold that reputation, uh, okay, so this is the mainline italian uh. The mainline italian has become incredibly popular recently. I only played it once in my life since I became a gm, I played it to beat my only super gm yakivenko, so I have a good experience with it. I don't have a great handle on white's main ideas, but what are the essentials of of this setup right? Why am I doing what I'm doing the pawn on c3 is, as you guys know, helping to prepare d4. I can't play d4 yet and what I'm going to do in this position is I'm going to orchestrate a very typical maneuver, you guys who play the ray lopez. I'm sure you know this. This knight from d2 is going to go to g3. What is the purpose of that? The purpose of that is that the knight will have access to this incredibly strong square on f5 uh. It doesn't mean I'm going to go there immediately because there's a bishop on c8, but I'm going to threaten that and he goes knight r4 now. The second idea of the italian comes into play. Do you remember I played c3. I just talked about this. How do I defend against this threat in the most efficient manner? What do I do? Uh, and- and this shows you how flexible and how resilient of an opening the italian is, we go t4, we intercept the bishop and we do it with tempo. This move is useless. We can actually play h3 and do something productive for our position and chase the knight away. He gives us the whole center, not a good idea. He probably wants to go here he's attracted by this move at tempo, but I've already talked no he's, not okay, so bishop, a7, uh and okay. This is annoying the hell out of me. So let's get it out of there and uh. Let's complete our maneuver that we started with knight g3, don't forget to do that. Okay goes he's playing already. Well, I mean our opponents are already playing pretty well uh and these wins are not going to be that easy. So how do we continue our development such that we do not obstruct any of our pawns and any of our control over pawns? So where? Where should we put this guy um e3 d2? What do you guys think we can actually put it on e3, and- and this is a typical idea in the italian uh- it relies on tactics but in this game just to keep the simplicity, I'm gonna go bishop f4, which is not my favorite move, but it's fine uh and I will explain why bishop e3 is generally the way that this is played because e4 is actually untouchable. Okay, um, we haven't really completed okay. Well, bishop b7, first of all notice that he's relinquishing his control over f5, not only that, but what he's doing and this people might not see right- this king is actually really really weak. It's not really surrounded by any of his pieces. You guys can see that all of his pieces are kind of clustered on the queen side and we can prepare a very typical sacrificial idea to blast open, uh the king inside now you guys might be seeing bishop takes h6, but can this move be prepared? Can we prepare to take on h6 so that it comes with a lot greater effect and if so, how and again this is. This idea is entirely within the range of typical. Now a lot of you want to go knight to five, but I'm greedy. I don't want to give this e4 pawn. I don't want to give away the c4 pawn I want to. I want to prepare it in another way and I'm going to go queen d2, uh and knight f5 would be fine. Actually, we can give the spawn up anyway and take on h6 and I'm sure that's good, but I wanna I wanna avoid any kind of complication, not only that but notice that when I take on h6, I'm gonna have a queen that lands on h6. I said many times that you need to employ the queen only for the most sort of big balls tasks. This is a pretty big boss task. I mean you're trying to check me the king I'd say this is good enough to involve the queen. Wouldn't you, the knights, are performing right now, a defensive role, that's great. They are supporting the central pawns, but they might just as well when the king side opens perform an attacking role. When I climb a little bit in raiding I'll talk about kinetic and potential energy, I think I talked about it already in previous streams, but I'll talk about it again in the context of the stream, as we take on h6 as flind uh and and taken h6 he's completely busted. Here. Look at his king. It's it's wide open. Now, knight f5 is going to be incredibly strong because he has no defense to checkmate. He has to give away his queen in the game and look how quickly we didn't even do any attacking, as my coach would say, prepare slowly attack fast. This is what that means right. You do all the necessary preparations so that you don't have to go crazy when you're attacking you can just make easy moves and by the way I had an even better way to prepare queen g7. What would it have been? It wouldn't have even allowed him to give up a queen while the pawn has pinned the f-pawn has been. What would what would it have been? No, no he didn't say anything I knight h5 yeah, knight h5, would have been even more precise. It doesn't matter, I'm completely winning because we are up a queen and we're mating him. I think that's good enough. Thank you eric uh. I think that's good enough intro light. Thank you for the prime. Let's go knight, g5 he's pinned and we're gonna prove him pre-move checkmate uh. This is pretty straightforward: attacking uh, okay, mate. I'm not gonna go over this with a fine toothed comb um at this point. This is just standard attacking practices. This was actually a really good game um and it's a very instructive one in terms of illustrating some of the main ideas of the italian which I'm going to do after the game. In the meantime, let's continue playing uh and I will do some sub sub events on my main account. So I knew I'll play you and uh. Let's continue with e4. Let's do another italian, I think. Well, okay, I don't know guys why it is that the philidor is so popular at this level. I wasn't aware of that uh and I don't particularly like it. Okay, so he's playing like the duke of brunswick against morphe and perhaps the most famous game of all time. Does anybody know how white should respond to this move? This is this is following the famous opera game, which probably over 50 percent of you know it's also one of the most overrated games of all time. Now the idea of bishop g4 is to pin the knight the problem is: he has to take the knight in order to be able to recapture the pawn. This is exactly how the morphe game went. What did morphy play here, uh and it's a very natural move. I bet morphy made here in order to develop a tempo he plays bishop c4. Are we doing this to threaten scholars mate? No, this is. This is not how it went right. The guy playing duke of brunswick played knight, f6 and then morphy played queen b3. I think uh we could play queen b3 anyway, but then he's going to go queen before check and he's going to force the queen trait. So, let's just focus on developing. I am angry. I can't recreate it. So, let's keep developing okay. Let's just keep developing, we are still overwhelmingly better. We have the two bishops uh his queen is obstructing the development of his bishop. I mean he's in very bad shape here and we're just going to keep developing. He continues to push his pawns out. I don't know why he's not concerned about this all right. So how should we accumulate the pressure? We've done. Some of the key development moves. What else can we do for our position here to take care of our pieces uh and remember, we don't always have to develop all the pieces in sequence, donald trump. I I agree with that approach. Rook b4 b5 would be very, very creative idea. I like that, but let's, let's play more stereotypically: let's get the rook to an open file uh to restrict his king even further. Oh man he's asking for it. Isn't he queen f6? Do we trade queens? Obviously not? Where should we slide our queen to think about the pathways to the king? Where should we put our queen uh? This would be tempting, but it doesn't actually threaten anything right because both of these squares are covered. Can we try to threaten a square? That's not currently covered. I see some of you saying h3 and that's exactly right or jeff. I would play queen g4 the reason. Why is because we're not making the tempting move that looks the nicest we're trying to actually get the queen over to c8? This square is uncovered the other thing we're trying to do is: oh, oh man, oh my lands. This was not the greatest yeah. Okay, mate. Okay, he just resigned. Okay, he thought I'm rubbing it in his face by not moving, but I'm just trying to involve everybody in the process and and before I go to the next game. I just wanted to to to clarify a couple of things here. Why did I not play queen d3? So, first of all, I wrote a chess.com article a while ago called queen the supporting actress, and I had the privilege of training with yasser sarawan a couple of years ago in st louis I did a three-day training session with him and he actually revolutionized my perspective on some of these things, including the role of the queen and yasser yes, daniel, so, first of all, yes, so what yasser said is is that very often this reminds me first of all of a story, so, okay, but seriously, because I want to keep things going smoothly and this will not be a long stream. Yasser said that the queen, we often think of it as the main attacker, the queen is the main attacker. It's the main, the big balls character, not always true. The queen is sometimes best in a supporting role, and I made this analogy to napoleon stuck in russia. Consider the queen to be your main general right queen is remain war general. Are you going to send out your main war general into the battle of sumter or whatever first battle you're fighting um? Is it going to be doing the frontline fighting, or is it going to be in the shadows directing the conflict? It's not a great analogy, because the chest is not war and blah blah blah, but you get the point. The queen is often best in the shadows, because it has long-range capabilities. It doesn't need to be in your opponent's face. We've talked about this theory. That's why very often we want to play moves like queen d3, we wanna. We want the queen to be first. You know we want the queen to aim at the king. It's not always how the queen works best by putting it on h3 we're putting it on a safe place where it's shaded by by some of the pieces and pawns, and in addition the queen is a lot more effective here aiming for c8 and d7, then it would be on d3, where it's aiming for d8, which is covered quite well by our opponents uh. I don't want to belabor the point here. I think people get it, but just wanted to kind of emphasize that that's the case. You can search up my article if you want more about this called queen, the supporting actress, that's how yasser called it one more game and then we're going to autopsy the last three mate 71 from slovenia. I think. Okay, let's play the sicilian again. We played this italian once yesterday. I'm gonna play it again and he plays bishop c4. Now, listen up and I'll talk more about tournaments and everything later I promise this is very commonly played by beginners against the sicilian. It is a literal transposition of the italian against this italian. The problem is, it doesn't work the same way and there is a very simple reason why the reason why bishop c4 is not as effective in the sicilian as in the italian. Usually, why is it exactly? You can play e6? You can blot the bishop and, furthermore, you can play d5 and occupy the center with tempo. Okay. Now I have the center get out of here and look at this bishop just staring at my well-defended pawn. That's not the way you want it to be. Now we can just develop our pieces normally and we've got a great position, I'm playing quickly here this position. How do we continue developing and we do so the same way that we would in any opening? You don't need to think of the situation as speaking another language, I mean we just develop our pieces actively in the same exact way. We could have also played h6 by the way to stop his bishop from coming out to g5, but the reality is this: bishop's development is a lot he's asking for it again. What should we do? What would I do here? You guys have seen enough of my my psychopath games to know what the heck it is. I would I'm sacking the knight here, I'm not gonna. Let him get away with this stuff. Okay, probably unsound, and that's the reality of it probably unsound, but look at his king look at the pin and uh. We need to be very careful here for black. We don't just want to willy-nilly throw our pieces at the king, that's not how you attack uh, the move, knight, t4, believe it or not. He can actually take on d5 and simultaneously defend the knight. So we got to be very careful here. Let's do this anyway, because it's the point is not to win his knight. The point is to orchestrate this tension on his knight that can be then used as currency okay. Well, he doesn't see it for the record. Bishop takes d5, uh would have defended his knight I'll, explain how I would have proceeded. Then he goes king g2, which is a big mistake. What should we do in order to transform our attack into a material advantage? Very simple move: um bishop takes knight it's a fork against the queen. The knight defends the bishop and let's take stock. We have a queen for two pieces and we have a couple of pawns on top of it. We're probably not gonna be able to defend this pawn, but that's fine. Let's try to remove the last remaining defender on his king right. His king is somewhat protected by his bishop. What can people suggest to do, and I know some people probably are thinking d4 but remember my key piece of advice here when you're up this much material. Your top priority is not to defend every single pawn, which is not to say you should be giving them away willy-nilly. But honestly, that should be very low on your list of priorities. Okay, what should we do now? Now that we've removed the bishop from f4? The bishop has been replaced with a knight knight's, far worse defender, and we can actually bring our queen. We can pin the knight attack the pawn and obviously we can play g5 and just snap, this knight off and the game is over all right. A very simple attack, uh and now some of the key rules of attack are displayed, by which I mean we. We should bring all of our attacking pieces and we shouldn't try to rely only on the queen, and ever I mean I really like the fact that everybody's just finding moves here. So this is awesome you guys are. I know that some of you are paying attention actively and concentrating, and I really appreciate that it's an honor uh to have to have people like that and- and I know everybody's busy- so thank you. I I this means a lot to me. People are really actively engaged and that's awesome. Okay, uh regarding the discord. Yeah, I've been really slacking, but, as you guys know, I've been really pushing the content production production recently. This this takes time for me to prepare uh and I'll. Try my best to keep that up as I stabilize okay uh. Well. Thank you note again. The honor is all mine and I appreciate it truly, but I'll talk about that later. Let's do the autopsy on the games and then we're going to continue now this first game. We played the main line italian. Most people play the fried liver for the record. The fried liver does not win, it is not. It is a good opening. I mean gm's play it, but what should black do in this position in the fried liver uh? For those of you who play one e5 with black, do not take the knight the pawn on d5. You already know this. You should play knight a5 uh, and this leads to some. You know very interesting complications, black sacrifices upon. If you want more about this, I did a session with nicola, which will continue as well. Where we talked about this at length. Black is compensation for the pawn in what form. Well, black is an initiative right. Black is attacking all of white's pieces, he's pushing his funds, we're not going to delve into the opening intricacies here. Just suffice it to say the position is about equal by modern theory, uh opinion and uh. It's an interesting line uh, but the mainline italian is uh has had a resurgence recently. Obviously it's been around since basically the 1600s uh, but but but it's a very uh. It's a very rich opening and it's it's an opening that I'm kind of sick of seeing at the high level, because the game's in a draw very often it's similar to the rye lopez in several different ways. How would I describe a position like this? What would you what would you pay attention to there's a couple of things to notice here: blacks, both sides are very solid, um both sides. Let me check discord, aquila ooh tequila in russian wow nice. That does look very nice, so both sides are, you know very solid here. Very solid, structurally white is supposed to have maybe a little bit a little bit of something because of this idea of going d4, I'm not gonna delve into the details of this uh. I will say what is the best for e4 players right lopez. Every time I personally have played the rye lopez a lot longer than I played the italian I used to play the attack. Well, actually I never played the italian. I played the scotch so when I was 14 1500 and when I come home in a week. I will I- and I forgot to do this the last time, but I will get out some of my old score sheets and I'll show you guys some of my oldest score sheets from 2003 2004.. I've kept all of them uh and I used to play the scotch and, after the scotch I played the rye lopez, which is a different kind of opening than the italian right. It's similar in some ways and it's different in others. It's just. It leads to different types of positions, uh and- and it's hard for me to summarize in one or two sentences, what the differences are contained. But there are similarities and there's transpositions, even from the italian to the rye lopez. The one thing that I want to say: if you do play the italian or the rye lopez in this position, you can play the move. Bishop e3 very common idea, also in the rye lopez. Why is knight takes c4 impossible? Can somebody tell me an extra credit, two reasons why knight takes e4 loses the game or loses a lot of material? I did insult your parakeets codex. I didn't miss your question, the lolly. I will get back to it codex. I sorry I missed your question initially, but I'll get back to it. Knight takes e4 very careful. We've talked about this scenario. Black can take on e1 with check, and then he takes the bishop. So careful one is this boom boom folkovich no way for black to save both pieces and then there's another fork. Well, actually, okay, I'm lying to people, I'm meant to say queen c2, also forks, but black can go queen e8 and defend both pieces and then now you're gonna have to go bishop d5 anyway, so the reality is both of these are reliant on bishop d5 um. Let's move on to the second game, which was which was a very quick one. Now morphy against duke of brunswick, is one of the most famous games of all time. I know that um most of you have seen it before. I think it's one of the most overrated games of all time. It's also called the opera game. Why is it called the opera game because it was played during a production of an opera? Paul morphy went to europe to play the strongest players in the world at that time, because he'd beaten everybody in the united states, he was invited by a dignitary, I think, from austria to to attend an opera and uh anybody who's been to. I mean I respect opera greatly, but it's got some comfortable seats and about 10 minutes into production of norma, which I don't remember who the composer is, but I knew that was the opera um. So now you know more about the opera game than anybody else. Um it was during production of norma, uh and morphe turned to duke brunswick who invited him. So I'm bored, let's go to the popcorn, stand except it's the 1800s. You don't serve popcorn with opera. Let's get some beer. Okay, they got a glass of beer during the intervention. Let's play some chess that we can all agree on. So they sit down. They start playing a chess game duke brunswick and his friend uh count isaward a second austrian dignitary sits down with paul morphy and they start bellini, okay and uh. They were not very good and that's part of the reason. I think this is a very overrated game. This is how the game started in this position. Count and duke played knight f6, which allowed morphy to slide his queen to b3 and fork these two pawns and the game went on for them. I'm not gonna show the game. Our opponent play queen e7, which is probably even worse because uh, it obstructs the development of the bishop and it allows our knight to get to d5 with temple. Now he's going to burn another tempo to stop her knight's get from t5, I mean so. This is just a humongous material advantage and really the most important move of the game was here: the move queen h3. We got a donut, oh chewy, with 50. picture this as a birthday card from your game. Well, thank you, chewie for the uh for the 50 bucks. The support today has been incredible uh, as has the viewership and and the the the community. So thank you chewie for 50 bucks and all of your support. I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you. So much th, the right move for black here would probably be 97, but now the bishop can't develop the poor bishop on f8 uh is always blocked by some pieces, and now we can try to get our bishop to c5 capture that knight and get our queen to see it notice that he cannot move the other night because he's always gonna get checkmated. I mean that's what he tried to do and he got checkmated so uh. You know this is this is just a horrendous position and that's why I don't recommend the philidor uh, because because it's an opening that, in order to play it properly, you have to really know a lot of theory you have to you know you really have to analyze it well and you can get into this kind of trouble. So this brings me to the final game and um. This is uh. The move bishop c4, which uh here in charlotte, we call this the scholastic variation and and the reason we call it. The scholastic variation is because a lot of kids, particularly they they play the italian or they play the bishops opening, and they they uh, assume not illogically that this would be a good move against the sicilian and it's it loses a lot of its effectiveness. Oh loli, yes, sorry codex, my bad! I might totally my bad sorry about that. We had a very good question from codex about the an opening called the lolly, so a beef when it gar challenged me. I was talking about this position where there's a very famous move. Knight takes f7. This is the classical way to refute uh, the fried liver, and recently it has been determined that the move d4 is also very good, okay and uh. This is not what people like to hear, because I'm basically saying you're not supposed to sack the knight you can just play t4 and explode the center uh, but I believe, according to modern theory, and I'm checking right now in chess base. Now, how would I check such a thing and let's make a quick detour for me to explain this? Let's say that I'm a gm whatever! I have a question which of these opening lines is better. What do you do? Here's where I go into chess base and let me share with you guys a chess-based board and show you exactly how I would determine to determine this and how I would analyze. How would I analyze an opening which I don't know assuming you have chest space? I know not all of you have chest space. I don't recommend it to everybody, but um I'm going to share the entire chest-based board with people and I'm going to just expand this so that so that you can see the notation and so that you can see stockfish when I open it. So just please bear with me for a moment. Okay, so let us just a little bit smaller and then this a little bit bigger and let's make this smaller and then this bigger and then this bigger okay. This is not going to be the best uh capture, but you get the you get the general image of it and I'm gonna make my camera smaller. So you can see okay, so this is. This is chess space and there's more things up on top here, which I'm gonna display for aesthetic appeal. I mean this is what the entirety of the program basically looks like uh. They basically copied microsoft word in a certain sense, uh, and- and they did that deliberately sorry, I'm just trying to expand this to include everything and it's not easy. This is fine. Now one of the greatest features of chess space is the reference button and the reference button allows you to see all of the recorded games that have been played in a particular position. As you can see, uh nike five has been played. 36 well, d3 is the main move, 36 000, and it gives you a bunch of statistics about every move that has been played percentage and it's always from white's perspective. So white wins 54.4 percent of the game, which is normal for white uh. You can see the best players. You can see frequent players and you can see all of the moves here. So I mean, if you go down the list, there's a lot of crazy. I mean somebody played king e2, probably hikaru uh, okay, no montevani played kingy too. That's probably some sort of a a mistake, because this guy's a reputable. I am uh okay. So that's a that's good to know, but anyways we go to the fried lover and to address codex's question knight: a5 is the main move knight takes d5, you can see, has been played four thousand times and white scores overwhelmingly in both knight takes f7 and d4. So I we can see that knight takes f7 is the main move, but this move. D4 uh is a recent, a recent move. We can see that it's been played a couple times in 2020. It's played a lot in the late 2000s uh, so and white scores overwhelmingly well, which basically tells us that this line needs to be investigated. That's actually how you find rare lines. If you see that the line has scored so well, that probably means uh. It deserves investigation uh. Even though uh it might be very rare and it might not have been played by that many good players, we can also click on elo white to see the highest rated player who's done something here. We see a short-plated hubner a lot of gm's. Thank you for the 400 bits, sriracha, I'm good, and now we involve our beast. We involve stock fish and stock. Fish will tell us a lot of what we need to know about the lime. This is stock fish 12. This is the latest version of stock fish and stockfish has a function called depth and depth is essentially how many moves ahead. Stockfish sees the higher the depth of the more informed the opinion about the position you get the more reliable it normally, when I'm analyzing an opening, I want to let stockfish reach depth 35 before I really trust its evaluation. As you can see, it's giving an evaluation at approximately depth, 32 of plus minus, which means that white is clearly better. Thank you lily and the evaluation is going down slightly uh and uh. You can see that white is much better here, but we would go back and see knight takes f7 and we would let it sit here and we would analyze and we would basically just see the evaluation. I mean this isn't rocket science at least initially, the evaluation is not as overwhelming as we might think, um and and what happens when you're a gm and you're trying to analyze this. Is you essentially look at all of the moves that have been played by humans? You list them. You say he takes d479 main line, bishop e7, and on top of that you always include stockfish's main move, because you assume that people prepare for this and then you basically use stockfish to create a file right if this isn't rocket science um. This is how I would do it. I would just create a file by analyzing all of these lines and trying to figure out white's best continuation and eventually I'd get a sense of. If this line, I would rather play- and I would do the same thing with knight- takes f7- which is of course more fun, uh and- and he would do this as well. So this is not the most interesting thing. But to answer your question codex, I think that d4 is considered right now to be a little bit better than knight takes f7. It's a little bit cleaner and it's harder for black to actually play, and the purpose of d4 is that you open up the bishop and in this position you can see the evaluation white is winning and the reason that white is winning is because he's got this incredibly strong knight he's got all these files. I mean the king is just caught in the crossfire of this position, and now you play knight takes f7, and this is much stronger in comparison, because you've got the e-file uh in comparison to taking immediately when the e-file is still closed, which makes it a little bit harder to attack um. So so so, hopefully, this gives people a little bit of a sense of how how people analyze it at a high level. Now, once you create the file, you memorize it right if you're a gm and you create a long file, I mean. Let me show you an example of what my file looks like okay and I'm trying to demystify this to people, because I I hate this this this entire uh school of thought that the gm's you know do this abracadabra like magic. I do the same stuff that you guys might do. I just do it, maybe at a slightly deeper level, but that doesn't mean you know, I'm doing anything special. So if you just give me a second I'll find a non-compromising file that I that I have made and um okay, so I I will reveal some of my preparation here, which is okay, which is okay uh. This is my file all right, oh, I know where I know where to find some of my files that I can show you guys if you just please bear with me for one moment, um- and I know people might be excited at this, but I want to open something that doesn't feature anything that anybody else recommended to me, because that would be unfair to that person. Yes, I found it here. It is there we go okay, so let me show you a file from 2015 and I was already a gm. So it's it's not like this. Is that old. So let me just replace this all right. Okay, there we go. I need to make this a little bit smaller, so you can see everything okay. So this is my file on the chigorin, which is an opening in the rye lopez and I'm analyzing this from black's perspective. So trigoran is one of my main lines: um and uh. I this is the official file that I made uh from black's perspective in the trigorin, and you can see it's just a chess-based file. It's also can be transferred into a pgn file. This is the chigorin by the way it's the line of the rylopa as the black and play uh, and you can see a couple of things here. You can see that uh, I'm I'm inputting a lot of text and the reason that I input text is that when I'm reviewing the file five years later uh, I I want to know why certain moves are played. I don't want to re-go through the process of determining why certain moves are made. I want all ready for that to be explained so that I don't have to constantly redetermine what the ideas are. You can see the d5, the old main line. Okay, that's good to know, which means it's probably not going to occur as often now blah blah blah and not the most popular move. So you can see- and in these positions I'm making a long text note really to explain the ideas. So I'm saying this is my recommendation: it might trigger and file for white. Almost everyone takes on d4 automatically, leading to a typical e4 d6, pawn position which blocks excellently coordinated pieces and the better. This is written the more easier it is to read. Five years later, you don't want to look at a file and for it to have some sort of crappy text that you wrote in two seconds. You want to put a lot of effort into this stuff, uh and- and one thing that I would do is if I were to go through this with modern stockfish. I would see that there are some mistakes, because computers have gotten stronger and I would update this if I haven't updated it, but you can see that my main line goes through move 34. uh, and I know that may seem impressive, but it's not that I want to do this. It's that I have to do this because this is how deeply people analyze nowadays and it ends in equality, which is, of course, what we want to do if we're playing black and- and this is just a an example of one such file- um- I'm not a specialist in the opening, so I don't have as many as I should, and I haven't updated them as diligently as they should. Thank you, badour uh. When we got a whoa, we got a fifty dollar donation from this is incredible. Badur jabava is not only in the chat but a 50 donation from grand master, bharat or jabba. I was going to show you my jumbava variation file, um and uh. That's a little bit recent, so I didn't want to leak that but badour with 50 bucks, uh and wishing me happy birthday and honor to have him in the chat and to have him watching my stream really. So. Thank you so much for a huge privilege to have so many strong players in in my chat, consistently uh. Thank you so much and nicola with 2 000 bits as well. Thank you. I can't even keep up with this okay, um and badur, of course, recently has started to stream. He's he's awesome, uh fymit! Thank you for the prime and uh. This is amazing. Thank you so much uh, everybody, okay, so back to the speed run because I know everybody's excited to continue. I think you get the point. This is what opening analysis looks like. I went in a little bit of a tangent there, but hopefully people find this. You know find this helpful, um yeah, definitely zay-z I'd, consider it. The reality is the more you memorize, the better uh and the more you understand the better. There is no limit or like target that I that I reach when I'm trying to memorize files, I'm trying to memorize as much as I can, but hopefully this shows you guys why chess is a full-time occupation. They don't show this in the queen's gambit, okay, when beth walks in to play borgob or whatever, and they did this the same the way in the old days, and they just had files that they would write down in notebooks. It's the same analysis I wouldn't be as extensive, but it would was the same process and this is the non-glamorous part of chess work that nobody really appreciates entirely. I think- and I don't mean this in an accusatory way, but but the reality is uh. This is not a glamorous process, it's very very cumbersome. It's very boring at times, if you think I'm not bored out of my mind when I'm you know sitting with stockfish for 10 minutes, letting it sit and think about a sort of boring position that may never occur. Of course it's incredibly boring for me, but it's necessary work if you want to get better so just wanted to give people a window into how this stuff works.
