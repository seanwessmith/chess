Five minutes seek a game game. One got my pen here, got the tea got the water. I've got everything all right and let's go e4 [Music], okay, so um, okay, he goes okay, so we've been playing the italian. I don't see any reason to change that uh. The italian is a great opening to okay, so h6 is uh. Is is a very weird move now in these types of situations we know that there are two main reactions right. We can open up the center immediately with d4 or we can prepare to occupy the center, which is my preferred option. How do we prepare to occupy the center with pawns and I like to occupy the center with bonds? That's just a personal bias, there's nothing wrong with the move d4, but I really enjoy the move c3 because I feel like when we occupy the center with pawns. Well, here we go. We played d4 with tempo. We attacked the bishop and he's going to be in very big trouble here. He just wasted a move with the move, h6, not something that you can really afford to do in the italian now, as I've talked about time and time again, one of the key mistakes that players often make when they seek to punish a move like h6, is to be overzealous right. They will, they will sack on f7 they'll, think that they have to play very actively. The reality is uh. The way to punish these types of moves is to play in a very measured style, which is not to say you don't want to attack, but you want to do so in a very sort of principled manner that is conducive to also the main principles you want to keep developing. In other words, and what we're going to do here is just keep developing our pieces. We're not going to do anything crazy, and what I want you guys to observe is that, even though we don't do anything crazy uh, thank you. Moose man for the prime. We are still going to very effectively punish our opponent for wasting a move with a move h6. In fact, he continues to waste time with bishop a5. So in the spirit of what I just described, how would we continue the game if we wanted to play as unimaginatively as possible? Just continue developing our pieces and making the moves? We know we have to make we're just gonna castle and he can do whatever the hell he wants. He can take on c3. First, we do the basic stuff then, and only then do we actually go after our opponent. Now we basically set the table we protect. Our king is safe. Now we can start to think about attacking the weak spots in his position. There's two main approaches here: there is a very advanced move, uh that I would actually play which bases itself on some loose pieces, but the classic move here is queen. B3 we've seen this one before right, combining with the bishop setting up a battery uh and attacking the f7 pawn, which he allows us to take uh. He shouldn't have done that, but he was already in very big trouble. We'll talk about that after the game. What would have happened had he simply defended that pawn with his queen uh. We know already that the queen is a very bad defender, so how? How do we follow this up? What do we do now? We've taken this pawn um and we've taken this pawn. Let me just note this down: what do we do now? Well, um? If we move this bishop away, some of you guys are noticing, then we will pave the way for the queen to come to f7 right. The bishop looks very fancy. Bishop g6, I like a little bit less because it would have allowed him to play queen f6 with tempo, attacking the bishop and simultaneously defending f7. So don't always go for that. Most appealing move uh! You know the bishops and queens are very easily misunderstood pieces. They are just as good from a distance as they are close by. In fact, they are often better from a distance that that is what makes them strong. Okay. That was a pretty easy game. He didn't do anything in particular to stop our threats. We will look at this after two. More games are played in the meantime. Let us continue almost to 1300. So we are, you know our level is rising and we're going to get another italian here. I don't think anybody minds that okay, so d5. That is a very common opening at the basic level. I have even played this with black against other gm's, who often don't know how to react to this uh, and I myself don't know exactly what the best line is. This is called the elephant gambit, let's just take on d5 he's playing it in a very weird way. C6 is not the move now. The first, the default in in any gamut should be the question. What if I just take those pawns, what does he really gain? Uh from the gimba and in this position there are in fact two pawns that we can take and which pawn do you think we should take? Should we take the c6 pawn or should we take the e5 pawn I'll give you in both moves? Are fine, neither loses, but uh one is positionally noticeably better than the other. Let's see yes, uh you guys are correct. Now, if we take the c6 pawn right, we help him develop. We do not want to help our opponent develop, so we're going to take a central pawn he takes with the queen. We know that taking with the queen in such positions is very dangerous, because we still have a knight on b1 that could, in the right circumstances, come out to c3 with tempo, but first we need to take care of the knight of e5. Do we need to move it back, or can we perhaps defend it in a manner conducive to our development? We absolutely can- and I like that- you guys are thinking in that precisely that direction. D4 yeah uh we're up upon his queen is misplaced uh and he continues to push his pawns and dig himself deeper into a hole. C5 is not actually as bad of a move as it may appear because he's undermining our knight. The way that I would approach this move is to ask ourselves what the drawback of the move c5 is. Does it perhaps weaken any diagonals? I know that you guys are thinking bishop c4, but be very careful because he can take on g2 with the queen, and we know that that particular move can lead to very nasty consequences. So if we think about where to develop this bishop, let's develop it to b5 and by asking ourselves what the drawback of the move c5 is. We can understand that it also weakens this diagonal allows our bishop to go out there now now. What we're going to do is called transforming the advantage we are up upon yes and we're up upon. Everybody is on board with that, but but in order to actually win this game, we're going to have to do is make a strategic counter sacrifice. What we're going to do: knight c3. He still takes the pawn on g2 guys. We need to solve the problem of the spot on trees. If we are going to counter sacrifice the pawn on d4 in return for very rapid development, which means what what can what I mean, what simple move? Can we make here just ignoring the fact that d4 pawn is hanging? This is a very powerful, very powerful concept. Uh that may not seem that fancy. It may not seem that impressive to anybody, watching, though, why is daniel going crazy about some bullcrap uh and just bear with me because after the game, I will explain what makes this concept of transforming the advantage so powerful. How do we react to this situation? Our night is actually not hanging. I'm gonna give people a hint. The night is not hanging. Why? Because if he takes it with a queen, we go rookie one and we pin his queen to his knight. So we have a very cunning move here. We can attack his queen because the knight is essentially untouchable. Now how should we attack the queen? I know everybody wants to play rookie one, but that's actually not the best move. Remember if he takes on e5 with his queen then, and only then do we play rookie one. Let us play bishop c4. This is a very advanced five head move. We are essentially compelling him to take our knight. If he doesn't take our knight, then we're going to play knight takes f7 and we're going to win his rook, so he either loses his rook or he loses his queen lb it for a rook and a piece, but because this king is stuck in the center that queen is going to be worth so much more than the rook end piece. So we're going to be essentially winning the rest is going to be a matter of bringing the rest of our pieces up and exploiting that open e file. Hopefully I've explained the process of finding this move, which takes its origin in breaking down your assumptions about the position and the times rejecting your assumptions, the better you are at chess uh, the less assumptions you tend to make about the position and the more you tend to question your fundamental beliefs right. So most people will look at this position and say: okay, my knight on e5 is hanging. I have to solve that. So let me take his knight, but what I encourage people to do is is immediately question that assumption right is my knight actually hanging what happens if he takes it. Well, then, what you see is that you have the move rookie one, so you can use that as a huge bargaining chip right. You can essentially use the fact that the knight isn't really hanging he's gone. Bishop c5. He is completely crumbling. What simple move do we have here to finish the game? That is a very typical mistake. He assumes that the bishop is defended. Of course the bishop is not defended because the knight is pinned. So we can simply take this bishop. He cannot take our queen because the king, the knight, is pinned to the king right pins. Are you know the language of tactics, uh and and and they have to be mastered right? Every single pit, particularly one against the king, must be noticed, paid attention to and incorporated in your thought process, one more game, and then we will analyze, and this game will hopefully help us reach 1200. If we win. Indeed, if we win, we will reach exactly 1200.. Now our opponent plays d4 and we have been responding so far with the queen's gambit, which I believe is the right of passage of most players. Most of you guys should be playing the queen's cabin um when you're beginners. Now there are some exceptions, king's indian is actually a good opening was for some beginners uh, but not for everybody. Okay, that would be scary if somebody were entering my door uh now in the queen's gamut. The the purpose is very simple: there are two main ideas of playing the queen's game. The first is, we establish a you know, a very uh, well serious claim. In the center we establish pawn on d5 that pawn on d5 is defended by the pawn on e6. The second thing we do is we aim to quickly and sort of effectively develop our king side without entirely sacrificing the activity of our pieces right. Our knight is nicely developed to f6. Now the bishop, one could say, is a little bit passive, but the reality is this bishop on e7 look at it very carefully. It can actually be the instrument that allows us to increase our claim over the center and that's exactly what we're going to do here. This bishop could support another pawn push that could create tension in the center, which is very complex right. It doesn't necessarily favor either side and that's what makes d4 openings oftentimes different from e4 openings. You get this sort of positional battle. Neither one of our kings is in particular danger of getting checkmated where the tension is occurring is in the center. It's all about the pawns here uh and it's a lot more positional than in let's say a king's gambit right where things get crazy very, very fast, and it's all about who checkmates who okay, so he plays a good move. Bishop g5 depends on our knight and what does it mean in this case to pin our knight what this means is that the pawn on d5 loses a very important defender potentially, so what we need to do is we need to add a defender to the d5 pawn right so that we counteract the effect of this nasty move. Bishop g5. What does that mean? We have to play bishop, but this movie is really powerful, daniel, well guess what we're black we're playing against a d4 opening. Sometimes we need to bite the bullet and play a couple of passive moves, and this move isn't so much passive as it is a defensive move. Uh defensive moves aren't necessarily bad, and here we go we're already reaping the benefits of it. He stubbornly takes on f6, but because this bishop is nicely protecting the d5 phone. What does that mean? That means he cannot take the pawn with the queen. He can only take it with the knight he does take it with the knight, and that is, ladies and gentlemen, a mistake, because he doesn't stop to consider the ramifications of this move. What are the drawbacks of this move, and I would like you guys to answer that question. What are the drawbacks of that move? Well, we can first of all take on d5 and take on b2 there's no actual need to take the knight on t5. We can take on b2 immediately the rook da, be careful he's he's attacking our queen with check right and even if it wasn't checked, we would not want to go rook d a now. This move is one to break down. So let me just write this down. Um 11 queen takes b2 discuss now he plays knight, for that is a blunder now. I have said time and time again that the queen is the worst defender of pieces and pods. We see here that the queen on d1 defends the rook on a1, so we must find a way now to get that queen out of the d1 square. We do so by going to should before check. It is essentially checkmate were it not for the move, knight d2, but after 92 uh. Your intuition should indicate that he is on the verge of collapse. We simply take on d2 if he takes with the queen. We take the rook if he doesn't then checkmate him, so he must choose between a rock and a hard place. Here we go. We win the rook and we win the game right. How did I find this? Well, as I said, the first thing I noticed was the fact that white's queen defends the rock on a1 and there are no other pieces that defend that rook. So if we can get that queen out of d1 force it onto another square, that rook on a1 is going to be hanging and we use our other active pieces to do that right. You look at your other active pieces, we're just going to take the queen and take the pawn we're going to win this in a very simple way. As I've said many times when you decide to go for method, one of converting a material advantage uh and those of you who've seen the speedo should know what method one means, which is essentially trading as many pieces as possible and winning the resulting end game. One additional crucial component of doing that method involves creating past pawns. Pass bonds are perhaps the single most important factor of any endgame and when we create them and when we're up material, our opponent simply does not have the firepower available to stop them from eventually promoting and either making new queens or forcing our opponent to give up more pieces uh to take those newly promoted queens. So we're simply going to push that a pawn. We're not going to do anything which is pushing that a pawn that apon simultaneously defends the bishop, which is always a nice byproduct of past pawns and we're going to keep pushing it. Did I blunder the bishop on v3 he's almost definitely going to take it in about two seconds: did we blunder this bishop on b3? Well, he's realized that something is amiss I still think he's going to take it, but we'll see um. Obviously we have not because we go e2 and the pawn is unstoppable. Such is the power of past pawns. Now you might be wondering right now. Why are past pawns important in the end game? Are they important also in the middle game? Well, yes, you know: can you promote a passport in the middle game? You absolutely can right, it's possible, it's possible to promote a passport in the middle game, um if your opponent is neglectful, but when you've got a lot of pieces on the back rank when you have a queen and you have two rooks, the probability of promoting a passpond in the middle game is going to be just pretty low right. It's it's not going to be easy, but in the end game you have very few resources left uh, consider it in a sense, a situation in soccer right where the goalkeeper comes out to kick the final corner. Kick the end. Game is like that final corner, kick where the goalie has come out of the gate and there's nobody guarding the goal right, the goal being the first rank here, and so it's very very easy to get this rook out of a1 and he resigns okay and we're exactly at 1200.. So, let's quickly go over. These were relatively simple games, but nonetheless, let's go over them and, as we are going over the game, perfect timing, we have a raid by grand master gary, my good friend, awesome player and awesome person. Thank you. So much gary hope. You had a fantastic stream. Uh and uh welcome everybody. You came at a great time because this is daniel. I am doing my instructional speed run uh not for very much longer but uh. We have just finished the first set of three games and I'm about to analyze them. So I hope you guys stick around. Thank you so much gary and have a great rest. I hope you had a great stream okay. So in this first game that I played today in the speed run, there was an italian he wasted time with h6 and we played c3. The purpose of this move is to occupy the center with the pawns specifically and whether or not you play d4 and try to occupy it with pieces is a matter of taste. I simply like the move: c3, okay, so d4 takes takes bishop b6, knight, c3, developing, very simply uh and after bishop a5 castle c6. This was one of the important moments now the move that I uh was sort of referencing as a potentially advanced move, is actually d5. Now you might be looking at this and saying whoa whoa whoa whoa. You are voluntarily blocking your own bishop. That seems to be precisely the piece that's giving the advantage. What am I doing? Well the reason I'm thinking about the move, d5, and actually I don't think it's as good of a move, as I initially thought. What justifies the move d5? What was my follow-up intention? What do what does white do in this position and can somebody for extra credit? Thank you gary for the 11 months. Why is this move that I thought was good queen a4 check not as good as I initially thought, black sc6, and this is what you have to be really careful about now: the queen defense a5. Now we could reopen the bishop on c4 right by taking on c6. We could do that uh, but what what will we have gained from this transformation? This is where things get very five head. Look at this knight on e7, ladies and gentlemen, look at it very very carefully. What is the function of? What is this knight doing? What this knight is doing is it's blocking the queen on d8? Why is it important that the knight is blocking the queen? Well, we have an idea that we can reapply here, which is particularly effective now, because the queen from d8 can no longer come to the support of this particular thing. Now. What am I talking about? What can white do now, and this involves combining ideas. Knight t5 is actually a very good move using this pin but think back to what I actually ended up doing in the game. Knight g5 doesn't work, the opponent is a knight, but de la citis. You have the right idea, you're looking at the spawn on f7, and you want to attack it. Let's attack that pawn on f7 guys, remember. We played this move in the game and it's okay to make a retreating move. I think this is a big problem for a lot of players is they're, unwilling to consider retreating moves bingo, and this is the magic of what we just did. The knight from e7 is disallowing the queen from coming to the pond's rescue and without that black simply has no way of defending the pawn without making the incredibly nasty and uh. Well, the move, f6 really doesn't even need discussion. I mean black's position is riddled with holes, so what we've done here is we've essentially provoked a weakening. Then we reopen the diagonal and we slide the queen back to f3 now. The reason this is important is because, in the game I played queen b3 immediately and our opponent could have gone queen e7 and defended the pawn with this queen as it turns out, the move queen e7 is perhaps less effective than it appears. Could somebody tell me why the reason is very, very straightforward: what does white have at his disposal, which is precisely the reason that black should have well, which is precisely the reason that they can push upon for 200 bits? 95 is exactly right. Attacking the queen get out of here. What do we do in a position like this? Well, we can do a bunch of different things. We can continue opening up the center uh. We won't delve too deeply into this, but it's uh. Well, I'm glad to hear that pushy fun so uh, but but in any case, at any rate night you know, inducing 97 would have taken this out of the equation as it stands, our opponent took it out of the equation by simply giving that pawn up, and now we drop the bishop back to h5, paving the way for queen f7 again. If he goes queen f6, we can go 95 chasing his queen away and if you go screen d a what should we do in this position? How should we actually finish this game off uh in the most efficient manner? Yeah? We should simply play knight, takes bishop and help ourselves to a all-you-can-eat buffet consisting of black's entire queenside uh. So that would be the simplest way of playing on to game two uh. But are there any questions about this game? And again, I wanna make it very, very clear, and I'm not just saying this right- I want to make everybody feel comfortable, no matter whether your ratings, a hundred a thousand or two thousand or three thousand um, and we do have some three thousands here, occasionally so uh. If there is a question that you're on the fence about asking you're, maybe a little bit embarrassed uh. This is a place where we're all here to learn. I make mistakes all the time. Uh, I'm open about that, and so should you uh, you know the likelihood. Is everybody wanted to ask that question and was just afraid. So, please by all means you know whatever you want to ask just fire away as long as it's on topic. Okay is d5 b4 achieve anything yeah knight b4 is the right idea, but it doesn't actually attack the c6 knight because the c6 knight is defending. You want to be careful about these kinds of moves right. If you wanted to move the knights somewhere else except b6, you could play well, you could not play knight take c7. This falls into something I shared before, which is that when you're discovering something you want to make sure that your opponent cannot take the piece that is doing the discovering and simultaneously defend the piece or the square that is being discovered. So you could also go knight f4. That is a very subtle move, but it essentially threatens knight g6. This would also be immediately winning because knight g6 is devastating, and so is queen. F7 black doesn't have defense against both of these. At the same time, okay great looks like everybody's clear. This next game was very straightforward as well. He played the elephant game. We take e5 um, because why is pushing middle pawns? Not good here, um yeah? Well, because we were sort of playing with our pieces um at what point is it actually worth it to learn things for openings besides opening principles? Well, I do not subscribe and I normally don't answer these general questions, but but because we talked a lot about the opening here, let me add my two cents, ladies and gentlemen, all this briefly briefly, and I will expand on this later. I do not subscribe to the uh preeminent and sort of prevailing, I should say coaching philosophy in many ways right and my students know this. I have very unconventional coaching methods and views on chess and one of the ways in which this manifests itself is. I don't. I don't believe in this whole thing that that beginners should not learn openings. I absolutely think beginners should learn openings and I think they should learn them deeply. I you know probably went you know, maybe a thousand and above right when you hit 900 or a thousand. That's when you should really start learning openings, but there's a lot of coaches who say you shouldn't touch openings until you're like 1800 or I've even heard some people say until you're, 2000, uh bs, complete bs that will hold you back tremendously, and learning openings at an early stage actually helps you not only acquire results, uh which I last I checked. People want to win games and what's wrong with that, but the second thing is: it actually helps you cement general chess principles. When you know your opening as well, you get good positions. When you get good positions, you have a greater chance at fostering the right kinds of habits early. So actually, I would say that you should start learning openings at a relatively deep level. When you hit a thousand, you should try to build up an opening repertoire. That is at an approximately 15 1600 level, which means that you shouldn't learn. Theory to move 25. Do not take this too far right, I'm not saying you should. You know, find magnus carlsen's email and hire him for a an opening training camp for a week and have him teach you his files right, there's a middle ground here, but you should definitely have a reference war. You should you should memorize some of the main lines and you should understand them uh and that's my two cents I'm happy to expand on this, but I will do that later, um, okay, so in this game we take the pawn on e5 in order not to help him develop his pieces, which would have been the case here. Uh now we play d4 to cement the knight- and I was, as I was going to say, right: bishop c4, you want to be incredibly careful when you make a move like bishop c4 when the queen is in the center in general, and this is a specific piece of advice for people uh when your opponent's queen is in the center. That is both a good thing for you and a bad thing right well bathing like it's a thing to be careful about, because the queen in the center has access to all sides of the board, and so you should be especially careful when you're developing your pieces that you're not leaving any pawns hanging, particularly the g2 pod right. That's something you can literally check for in these types of situations uh. So what we did here is we developed with tempo and we just castled. We gave up the pawn back in order to transform our advantage from a material advantage to pat the pawn into an initiative right. A development advantage and an attack and chess games often cannot be won without understanding the moments when you take one type of advantage, such as an initiative and transform it into another, such as a material advantage or as we did here. Vice versa, and this move. Bishop c4 was at the crux of our play now: rookie one would have been very good as well setting up a discovered check which could have been devastating, but bishop c4 is even stronger because we basically forcibly win his queen and then we win another pawn and then a bishop okay, so that was straightforward, which brings us to this final game. Uh, the queen's gambit, and, as I explained this is a more positional opening. We get a very common structure here. What is the structure generally called? Can somebody supply, for maybe term that is often used? Well, it's it's a self-explanatory term. How are these structures called iqp iqp stands for isolated. Queen spawn isolated means. There is no neighboring pawns queen's pawn. Well, it is a green pawn isolated queen spawns because it can occur uh for white and for black an example of an opening in which white is the one who possesses an isolated queen. Pawn is the pawn of karo khan to give you an approximation, this would be a position in which white has an isolated queen, spawn uh or an iqb. So this happens. You know from both sides now one moment please. Okay, now um this time I was the one with an iqp. You cannot say in one breath whether isolated queen spots are good or bad. That depends almost entirely on the way that the pieces are placed. Why is that the case? There are many situations in which isolated, queen spawns are extremely problematic and in fact the general principle by which you can understand uh isolated, queen pond positions is is- and this is very general there's exceptions- the less pieces there are on the board, the more the isolated queen's pawn becomes less of a strength and more of a weakness. So if you imagine a graph right, the the the less pieces there's an inverse inversely, proportional relationship between the strength of the of the isolated queen's pawn and the number of pieces on the board right. I'm not. I feel like I'm over complicating this, but you get the point. The less pieces there are the weaker that isolated queen's bond is now. Why is that the case? The reasoning is very simple right, there's, just not enough pieces left to defend it, um it just becomes like any other backward or weak bond. When there's almost no pieces left, it has to be defended by all of your pieces and that's never a good thing to have something you have to tie yourself down to uh and quad to yesterday. Thank you for the twitch prime. I can show you a litany of model games on the topic of isolated queens pawns becoming weak with less pieces on the board um. Let me try to see if I can quickly hunt down one of these examples. I have a game in mind between karpov and kirchner, and it's only karpov was one of the greatest specialists in uh, both sides of the isolated queens bond, both with with the queen, pawn and against it uh, and I found this example, so let me go into the chess-based scene, so this is a game between two players who I'm sure most of the viewers are familiar with: porch noise and karpov court. Schneider, of course, one of the strongest grandmasters never to become world champion uh and this game was played in the world championship match 1981 and they played several of them between karbov and korchnoy, which of course, karpov won. Now karbov is playing black here. This was indeed a queen's game, and now I wasn't lying when I told you, the queen's gambit leads to a lot of isolated queen spot positions for both sides. Here white is the one with the isolated queen pawn. Now I want you guys to pay very careful attention to what karpov does in the next couple of moves. He starts embarking on a campaign to trade as many pieces as possible. That's all he does right. He doesn't do anything mysterious boom, knight, h5, get those bishops off the board, and now korchner makes a very instructive mistake. Korchnoy goes 94.. Now this is 1981, they didn't necessarily understand structures as well as we do now. There are certain things that we take for granted, which players of the time you know sometimes stumble. Korchnoy helps karpov trade, all of the pieces boom boom boom and now look what happens. Well. All of the minor pieces, almost all of the minor pieces are gone and with the minor pieces gone, this d-pawn has just become a regular weakness. White has no more pieces left to attack with, and so karpov just starts to attack this bomb. Look at this all of white's pieces, every single one of them other than the bishop are tied down to the protection of this d4 pawn, and that is a disaster, and course joy makes things even worse. He trades the last pair of minor pieces. This is an incredibly famous textbook example of how to play against the iqp black has traded. All of the minor pieces, and literally now, all of white's remaining pieces are saddled toward the protection of the spawn which karpov dooley wins. Well, he doesn't actually win it, but he uses it as a ploy and he opens up the position of white's king and because white is so tied down to the pawn white, neglects the safety of his king and gets checkmated and he loses his rook and he loses his queen so uh. I really went fast through this game, but I hope that it at least partially illustrates how to play against the isolated principle. Now, how do you play with the isolated queen pawn? Well obviously, by newton's law of opposite reactions? You need to keep as many pieces on the board as possible, and one of the classical ways of playing with the iqp is actually to prepare its advance forward. One of the scariest scenarios, when you have the iqp is allowing a pawn push such as d4, which not only rids you of that iqb, but oftentimes leads to disastrous consequences for the side that allows the prawn break. Okay, so often times the battle. When you talk about uh is occurring on the square in front of it is the side that's playing against the iqb, going to be able to establish a blockade on that square or is the side that has the iqp going to be able to push that iqp forward, uh absolve themselves of the iqp and, as a consequence, uh develop a tremendous initiative, so that is often the battle. Now, I'm really oversimplifying this there's a lot of of of intricacies. There have been books written about the iqb literally, and I can direct you to some, but I think this is more than enough for the average player. I hope that this at least partially clarifies things. I know it's a bit of a mysterious topic: iqb uh, but hopefully you know. People are at least a little bit more in the clear about what can happen. Uh in iqp type positions, uh. Now what we did in the game was we actually lent some support to the iqp? Our opponent attempted to take that iqp immediately, and this leads me to the second point about iqp's, which is that they're often mind mind pawns right. They're often like land mines, you step on them, they explode and unintended consequences arise as a result, because white is not developed as king side he's just not ready to to meet this right, he's not ready for the queen to appear on b2, and he loses very, very quickly um. I could have also taken the knight first and then gun queen takes b2, but I wanted to keep the tension right. This knight on d5 is not dangerous. If it comes to c7, I go bishop before check and once again I just take on d2 just just like I did in the game. Okay, uh, the rest was very simple: we take the rook, betray the queens and win the rest of um. Take the rest of white spawns, um, absolve, luis lucha, okay, absolve, that's a good word. Okay, any questions about this game or any questions about my explanation of the iqp. Before I move on to the next set of games, how do you play against complex, aggressive gambits or traps like elephant without knowing anything about a theater? Well. This brings me first and foremost back to my point, which is that you want to learn the theory of these gametes. That is what I'm working on right. Now, I'm working on a project where I analyze all of these gambits. That's a hard project that danish, the england, the stafford and you know the elephant. Even if you're a beginner, you want to learn at least a couple of moves in each of these gambits so that you don't have to think independently every time you're faced with them, but fundamentally, when you're, faced with a gamba that you feel like might be, annoying you feel, like might be, might be dangerous. Uh. You want to first and foremost, adhere to general principles right if you're developing your pieces, if you're not grabbing questionable pawns, then chances are nothing terrible is going to happen to you if you are not sure about taking a pawn that is gamuted to you by some opponent, then don't take. It simply keep developing and a great example of that uh. I faced this move that I actually wasn't even familiar with the move knight d4 in the italian. I wasn't sure about taking the pawn. It turns out that after queen g5 white is in trouble, and so I simply decided to develop and as a consequence, it turns out that castles is indeed white's. Best smoke and white is something better okay. So you want to weigh the pros and cons of that. That's a very short cutting kind of thing, and it's, it all depends on the specific opening, but that would be a couple of specific tips on on that topic.
