That is crazy, bruh [Music]. So we're going to play the king's indian we're going to play the kings indian, which we've been kind of focused on throughout the speedrun, because it's the opening that I play. I also think it's a very instructive opening and um. I I hopefully have done a halfway good job of explaining the sort of basic tenets of the king's indian. Now do you guys remember what the what the main move here is? This looks like a blunder of a pawn, but as I've explained previously, this actually is the main move. It does not blunder upon because there's a tactical reason behind it. The move is e5. Let's hope he doesn't take um. I I don't like playing against the exchange. Now, I'm going to go for a structure that I have gone for before I'm going to take on d4 and the way to understand this is I've explained previously right. White's got the space advantage. What white's got this bind on my center, but I have the ability to immediately and frontally attack white spawns. How and I also have a secondary ability and the secondary ability is to prepare a pawn breakthrough, so this is kind of like the morocci vine. It's not literally the morose bite, it's kind of like the merotzy mind. Now what pawn breakthrough can I prepare? And how can I prepare it? It's when you, when you scour the board for breakthroughs you you should see the d5 is the idea that we want to prepare, but we can't go d5 immediately that obviously blotters upon, so we just prepare it with c6 yeah. That's all there is to it. This is the theory yep, so d5 he takes and goes c5 that's the theoretical line. Let's see if he knows it, he does a c5 is the move, and now we simply want to develop our knight. This is still theory. As far as I remember now, after he castles. We want to increase the pressure on this knight right. We have our knight pressuring his knight, and we actually want to make him. Take our knight I'll, explain that after the game, uh and I'll explain the point of c5 as well um. But how do we increase the pressure on his knight? How do we turn that volume dial up up um knight h5 yeah? Well, it's not crazy right knight, h5 attacks, the knight on d4, and where can this knight potentially go well, this knight can potentially go to f4, which is a really nice square right, so you're killing two birds with one stone, and I like these positions, knight b5, is, I think, the best move. So actually, let's go knight f4, I don't see a reason not to, and now we can continue increasing the pressure on the king's side. How? How can we continue increasing the king side pressure? So we have our knight here, it's it's already sort of pressuring g2 and now we can try to go queen g5 and really turn the heat up on the king side. I don't see a reason not to do that. Uh and you know black is already white- is already in trouble. I think, because we're threatening checkmate we're also threatening a potential check on h3 people should see that, because the pawn is pinned to the king and uh he's got a lot to take care of here. Okay, so what should which of the moves? Should we play here? We obviously can't jump over the pawn and deliver the checkmate, but a move like g3 should set your alarm bells ringing immediately because um, because it creates so many weaknesses on the king side. Now, should we take the bishop? Should we take the bishop we? Okay again, I I trick a lot of people by asking that, but we absolutely should, because by taking the bishop, we are creating very big weaknesses in his position. In particular, you guys should notice uh this e3 square. Let's take on z4 once simplifying the position, and now we win the game with what move yeah. We win the game with queen e3, because we simply win the night, and not only do we win the night, we can take it with the bishop or the queen, all right, we're going to take it with the bishop, because we're also paving the way for the queen to come to f2 with absolutely devastating effect. That is the power of the king's indian when it is played well, okay, so that is a relatively good king's indian win. Now he played what's called the glitterage system, that's bishop e3 and um f3 c6. Now. Another good reason that we play c6 is that this bishop on e3 is undefended. So if he castles, then uh, then we play d5 and he can't take on d5 with this pawn because the bishop hangs and if he takes with the c pawn, then we actually can play knight takes c5. This is my game against robert hess from 2012 over the board. This is a line, and this is very bad for white for basically the same reason as in the game. His knight on d4 loses its support, and this just looks pretty darn ugly for white, so he goes bishop f2, which is the correct move. He drops the bishop away from the square where it was x-rayed by the rook. D5 takes take c final. What is the point of c5? The point of c5 is essentially to keep the position closed down. Number one, and also this knight on d4 remains sort of robust as a blockader. If you don't play c5, let's say: if you just castle, then black has the potential of opening the position up and when the position opens up the knight on d4 kind of loses its value. The knight on d4 its value comes from the fact that it blockades the pawn on d5. If this pawn is gone, then the knight is just sort of another piece if that makes sense, so knight c6 is correct. Castles and now knight h1. Now here's the moment where he went wrong, um and actually no no here is the motor. Actually, the move is not to castle and in this position he has to well. Actually he has to stop knight f4. If he lets me go knight f4, that knight is devastating because it pressures the bishop. It creates the possibility of queen g5, there's just too much stuff that that goes on there. So how does he stop knight f4, but without weakening his position? You don't want to go here. You do not want to go here, because that weakens so many of these squares around the king side. What should white do here instead, queen d2, is correct. Nice job orange, queen d2, is absolutely right. Good job, now, bishop, a lot of your bishop e3 blunders, the bishop bishop g3, remember, there's a knight on d4 that blood is the knight. So you you, you have to keep the bishop here where it controls the knight there's a lot to take care of here we need to is the move so knight cb5, he's just underestimating the danger, and at this point, he's already in big trouble, he's already in big trouble, because this is not easy to defend against it's very much, not easy to defend against and again if he plays a move like bishop g3 and he says get out of here, then you, you might notice that the knight on d4 is not under protection. What does black do in this position to win the game? What does black do in this position in the game? You notice that the knight guards the bishop but the great thing about the king's indian bishop, the knight, can be captured. You take the knight here, not the bishop, but the knight, because the bishop on e2 loses its support and you can potentially also lose your queen, so that just is game over rookie one queen g5 and he's already busted uh. If he plays bishop f1, then we go knight, h3 and knight takes f2 and we win the queen. So I don't see a defense for him at this point. Literally everything loses here. So this is why why these positions are so fun, I mean they're, open and, and everything seems to win. So it's very hard to play this with white unless white is extremely well prepared. That's why you want to be careful about which positions you go into yeah. That's all there is to it so well, h4 doesn't okay, so h4 in this position. What would get me cautious about this move or sorry, not not in this position, but in this position? Wait in which position I'm not sure which position you're referring to so oh? Why do we want him to take so if he takes on c6 if he takes on c6 the reason this is good for black there's, two main reasons: this trade is good for blind. When you are evaluating traits uh, don't overthink it. You have to compare it before and after you know those commercials before and after hair treatment, you know before they and it always looks like it's. A different person, like literally the person before, is the most miserable human being on earth and then, after he's like the ceo of 18 companies, but you got to do the same thing um. It strengthens the center right there's a pawn that appeared on c6 there's a pawn on d5 that pawn is passed, and now it is a protected passed. Lawn, protected passports are good. The other thing it does is opens up the b file. Who does the b file benefit? Well, it benefits the side that can occupy it and exert pressure down. The people can white exert pressure down the b file, no obviously there's a pawn on b2. This is why it's called a semi-open file, because only one side can benefit from that file. That would be black. You can put a rook on v8 and exert pressure on b2. That's all there is to it right, uh, that's why we want them to take. We still want them to take. That would be the same exact thing. Basically um yeah, I know there's a lot of question well, knight c2 doesn't actually help prevent knight f4. Well, the light squared bishop is sort of held in reserve. Yeah knight h5 is very, very common idea in the king's indian um. Why didn't you want him to take in the beginning? Well, I just don't like playing against the exchange variation, the exchange variation forces, an endgame exchange variation forces, an endgame and that's a very early stage to force in that game. I remind you guys that if flight takes on e5 with the pawn with the knight, then we should notice that the bishop is x-raying. This knight, the knight is undefended knight takes e4, wins back the pawn with interest and uh black is actually slightly better in this position. Without this, the king's indian literally would not work at all. So this this is like important. Okay, all right um. So that's that game. Any questions any last questions. Okay, let's play one last one, and then I might call it a knight, really appreciate everybody's support. Of course, okay, let's go e4 this time. Let's go e4 this time and a karo khan, so the line that I've been playing almost exclusively, let's play the narrow con queen f3, is the nereidski card gun. This is an opening that I have been playing almost exclusively um against the car con for like a year in blitz and um. It's an opening that contains a lot of traps and one of them actually happens here. We don't actually move the knight, so white black attacks tonight. What does white do here to not move the knight like what other move does white have here? Yeah, it's bishop c4, so you attack, f7 and knight. F6 is a mistake here. Knight f6 in this position is a mistake: he's got to play e6 and he actually plays it correctly. Now we go back to e2. Basically, we get this really interesting, pawn structure right where okay, it's like this pawn structure occurs in other openings. But what we're basically going to try to do is we're going to shift this queen. Why are we going to shift the screen because we need to develop the knight and we want to develop the knight to f3? So that it attacks d4, where do you guys think we should put our queen on f3 like what would be a nice spot to park it on? So d3 is kind of awkward, because then we would not be able to develop this bishop. Okay, I know you guys are thinking about attacking the pawn, but remember black can just play c5 and he can easily defend the pawn. In fact, he does exactly that um. So, in fact, I'm actually going to play the move. D3 first yeah, queen g3, queen g3, is where we want to park our queen so that it exerts pressure on the pawn. The bishop on f8 cannot move um and he's got to play the move g6. In order to liberate the bishop and that's kind of a weakening move, then we can play the move knight f3. Now, what move can we play first before playing knight f3? If we wanted to grab some more space on the queen side, what move yeah so we could consider playing f4 now. The drawback of that move is that it would kind of block in the bishop and in this game in this game um, but on the other hand, it would really help us expand on the queen sides, king side. So let's procrastinate, let's procrastinate, let's first develop our bishop, let's see where he puts his knight and if he puts his knight on g6. Okay, let's go f4. Why not? Let's go four and then we're gonna develop the knight behind the pawn. Of course he can trade queens with queen h4, but I don't really mind an end game here. We've got more space. White is okay, so you guys have five now the obvious immediate question we ask ourselves when we face a move like this is: do we need to react to this? Do? Is he actually threatening anything specific and do we benefit from taking on f5? We actually kind of do, and I want somebody to tell me in what way we benefit from taking on f5. This is a subtle observation. Now. The way that we benefit from taking on f5 is that he will not be able to castle. He will not yes, so not only do we open the e file and we're going to castle and quickly put a rook anyone, but he will not be able to castle uh, even if he gets his bishop out this bishop. As long as the bishop is on c4, it covers the castle square. He can try to castle long, but he's a long way away from doing that because he hasn't developed the c8 bishop. Yet okay, so let's, let's bring our knight out first and then we're going to very quickly put a rook on e1 and maybe knight g5 comes I'm telling you this line of the karo khan is super dangerous and okay. Obviously, let's get our rook over to e1, okay, whoa and now what what do we do now now the attack literally plays itself. We consult all of our pieces. Okay, which pieces? Can we activate and we see a very simple move- knight g5, of course getting to f7? If he goes rook cafe, then knight takes h7, wins the game and he just resigns. This is over. I mean that f7 is a totally devastating threat and uh. That is why this line is very dangerous. There's a lot of traps like this in the narrow con um, and I don't like playing it, because the emphasis of the speedrun is not on winning with traps, but it's actually kind of a legitimate opening. It's been adopted by a lot of other gm's. I think it's called a goldman variation formally so queen f3 now the move queen f3. Let me tell you a little bit about its history um. This is a very unorthodox move. Obviously, because uh the knight belongs on f3 you're, literally putting the queen on a square where the knight belongs. It's gotten very popular recently, it was played by vasily smith love world champion from the soviet union for the first time in 1950, so russians were the first like five or six people to actually play this line, uh, which is kind of cool. I guess it's uh symbolic right. 1950 smith's love against floor uh floor was uh. Oh, it was played in the candidates tournament, so it was played in a really high stakes event for the first time by vasily smith. These guys are pretty good. Now. What is the main trap of this line? The main trap black plays knight f6 most of the time here. While this is not a mistake, it actually can lead to very quick victory. I have won me. I've been moro with this line. What I'm about to show you and I have beaten, countless players with this line. Here you go e5. The knight drops back to d7. Okay white needs to defend this pawn. How does white defend this pawn? Well, obviously well 96, because then he just takes e6 is interesting but d4. Now what is the usual way in which black undermines this pawn chain like how in the french? How do you guys? You guys know this move right? How ryan khc priming thank you c5 c5, but but but he can't believe c5. Yet did it he can't play c5 yet because the pawn on t5 will hang so. E6 is what everybody plays, and now white makes a very innocent. Looking move knight, h3, ah big deal, c5 and people think that they're better here, because normally in these positions, white wants to play. C3 and white wants to defend the pawn on d4, that's sort of standard practice, but black is losing here losing knight g5, but white is winning because after queen e7 and do you guys want me to tell you how many times I have had this happen in my chess career, I see my game against cecaro in the slime at the very least um. So hikaru has fallen into this among other people, because the move knight to b5 wins the game white is winning, because there is no defense against these two threats. There is simply no resources that black can allocate to defend against these two horrific horrific moves. Black loses a ton of pieces, a lot of people go f6 here now you go knight c7 check. King d8, knight g takes e6 check. It's basically checkmate black has to give his queen up and the game is over. So this line is one of the appeals of the of the narrow con, but we can also see in uh this game. Does anybody want to venture a guess as to why knight f6 is actually inaccurate? Here? This is really cool. This is really really cool stuff, yeah e5 now watch what happens? E5 d takes e3. Okay, he takes the knight we take his knight. You might look at this position and say well wait. A second uh black can win a pawn. Black can win a pawn. Black can play c, takes d2 check. Okay, it's check we have to take, and now black can play. He takes f6, but look at the development that white has and white combines this development with castling and all of a sudden black is in huge trouble he's completely undeveloped. His queen is under attack. His king is on castles. The bishop on c4 has ideas of sacrificing himself on f7. This is like incredibly hard to play for black black is already worse. I had this happen in a processly game. I botched it, but I was basically winning right out of the opening and um. This stuff is really dangerous, so his move e6 is actually correct, but my opponent went really wrong. I think at at this point after he goes knight g6 I mean I think I would go g6. I think not developing this bishop. For a very long period of time is not a good idea, like you have to get take care of that bishop and uh, then you have to castle quickly, because the way that this happened, when I played f4 and still bishop e7 here, I would castle as quickly as possible. The move f5 is a very serious misjudgment and I think I've explained sufficiently why this is a misjudgment. The main reason is that, even if black were to now develop his bishop, it's too late, he cannot castle literally it's illegal and the time that it takes to talk the king away on the queen side, and it just doesn't come fast enough. Okay, because I'm going to put my rook on e1 and I'm going to already be threatening like a discovered check, that's totally devastating, so this k-98 is kind of caught in the crossfire. If that makes sense so that I mean you can see how quickly the attack proceeds and he resigns here, because the threat of knight f7 is absolutely devastating and if black defends against it by putting a rook on a thing, why? What move does white play here? I said this during the the game, but who can remind me of the move I mean at like a 16 1700 level. You can absolutely yeah boom boom. There's no way to sustain everything. Okay! Well, but I'm explaining that william. He resigned because he has no way to defend against knight f7. That's literally, why he resigned, I'm not sure how else I could sort of explain it. If you have a specific proposed move, uh, I'm happy to analyze it um. You know what I'm saying, but, but otherwise I you know it's the fact that this threat is totally devastating and um. There is no other defense. Well, 96 doesn't win the queen right. 96 bishop takes c6, so the specific threat here is specifically knight at night. F7, okay, kb7, I suppose, might be the best move, but now I can send you back with a check and um. If you go to this side of the board, then you walk right into the x-ray of the rook. This is going to be devastating. Thank you flat dog 522. So this is crushing. Well that's what I'm explaining right! Bishop e6 here is crushing: all of these squares are just weak, there's too much attacking potential. That white has he trusted that I was that I would be able to find these types of moves. Why can't queen take on f7, because the f7 square is protected by the bishop, so, in the event of let's say a random move, then we just take the queen with our bishop. We recapture it with our bishop, okay um. Does that make sense? Could he have prevented him? No literally, he is losing at this point. I think that his last chance to do something- maybe at this position he could have probably gone. I don't know. King fa, maybe but still knight g5- is really really devastating, because this threat is horrible, so yeah black has to castle asap uh. It really doesn't matter which rook we use. I just think this creates a more elegant effect. Well, rook f8. We take on before again there's too many avenues of threats here. You guys are defending against one and allowing another so yeah, maybe queen e7. I don't want to get too detailed here, but the bottom line is clearly white's got the big initiative. Clearly white's got the big initiative and it's it's incredibly hard to defend against this stuff. If that makes sense all right, I guess we can do one more. I guess we can do one more okay, matilda we're playing the same guy. Okay, um! Let's play a sicilian: let's go back to an accelerated dragon which, oh, my god, proper 25 after everything that happened this morning, wow. Thank you, proper 25 holy smokes. Oh distracting me from the game. I see what you're doing now. I see what you're doing now, damn girl. Now what? What do we take the bishop with here and we actually have had a game like this before which way do we take the bishop we so actually most people think b takes, but we actually take with the d pawn as I've explained previously, and there are several reasons for this: it's complicated, but first of all we're opening the bishop and that's uh. That's a pretty important thing, also we're sort of increasing our control over the d file. Well, thank you prophet. You are very sweet and in order to increase our control over the d4 square, specifically uh, the move that we play here is e5, which is a move that confused a lot of people the last time we played it because it seems to block in the bishop- and I totally get that uh, but I'll sort of put this into context after the game. Remember the expression, bad bishops defend good pawns. That is a very important expression and that expression helps us understand why this move is justified. So let's go a5. Let's stop him from expanding on the queen side. Now we want to develop this knight to e7. We don't want to put it on f6, because that would just blunder the pawn okay. So I'm going to do the same thing I did in the previous game. We go queen to c7 to defend the pawn on e5 and this there's a certain kings, indiana component to this game, in that what is black's main idea here? What is one of black's main ideas here? How are we going to attack the king side? Okay, b4 is actually a really really strong move yeah, so we want to play f5, but I actually forgot about this idea. He just uh. Well, actually, is it, though? Okay, so so there's some interesting stuff that happens, so he breaks through with a5 um. That's a pretty interesting idea. I'm not sure how good it is. I'm not sure how good it is. I think it's actually really really good. Let me think um yeah, so the thing is: if we attack the knife we go b5, then he goes knight to b6 attacks the rook, and then he wins c5. So let's actually take the pawn. Let's take the pawn and um black is probably worse here, but it's not clear so now, uh white is like not threatening anything. Horrible white has all of these little mini threats. It would be too early to play f5 because our rooks are not connected and our bishop has not developed. So let's develop our bishop and let's see how he plays this, but basically we want to prioritize completing our development here, because our position is kind of flimsy. If that makes sense, and so we need to complete the development as much as as much as possible thanks again prophet thanks trav man, you are absolute beasts. It's called the rosso limo yeah, so we're currently up upon. He can play bishop d6 and win the pawn back. But it's you know: it's not um, it's not clear who benefits from that, because we also have a passport on a5 and stuff so uh, it's a very, very complex position, lots to take into account here uh, let's see how he decides to play this. Thank you um mq. So I'm getting a lot of christmas presents here early and that is honestly awesome, so appreciate it. Well, bishop b6 we go queen b7, so we're not trying to cling to our extra pawn here. Thank you, chris g s, y for the prime we're not trying to cling to our extra fun. What we're trying to do is give away the pond with interest. That is a a thing that I want. People to understand when you are up upon one of the one of the benefits of being up upon is that you can give it back with interest. You can give it back at the right moment, uh and you can give it back and gain something in return if that makes sense- and this is what we're essentially trying to do here- so I would definitely prefer bishop d6 and bishop takes e5 here- he's burning a lot of clock trying to find the best way to do this, and I think he's failed to do that because he is attacking art rook. Where should we put our rook? Where should we put a rook? This is not a very complicated question because yeah we just go rook a6. We attack the knight we are threatening to take it radio math! Thank you for the two months. I appreciate it. Okay, so he's done something really weird here right: he just drops his knight's a4. He doesn't recapture the pawn now we can go about improving our position. So what I don't like about this position is this pin. This pin is annoying me because the knight can't move, let's get the rook out of the pin, let's also put it on a file where it x-rays the queen. Okay, now um, let's just go, h6, create some love for the king and also cover the g5 square. Okay. So now we need to find a way to basically push his pieces away from uh, no problem. Okay, we're no problem at all yeah so, like I may be, this is actually not so easy. I see what he's trying to do here. F5 is see I'll, explain this after the game. F5. Our position is way too fragile to allow for something like f5 and I'll sort of flesh that out after the game. Let's go king h7 here, okay, let's preemptively uh defend the h6 pawn so that if he plays bishop e3, which he does uh he's not attacking the pawn, and we actually have a tempo here to do what we want to do and what white is threatening here to go knight c5, we move our rook away and he cripples our pawn structure with knight takes e6. How can we preempt that yeah? We can consider? Actually I really like weed c8 for several reasons. Part of it is that I support the bishop on e6 and another part of it is that you can definitely consider a sack on h3. Although you know when we do sack on h3, we will only have a queen in the attack and that's a danger zone kind of thing. Okay, so he takes. We take okay, bishop b6, okay, rook db8, maybe okay. He wants to take this way, but then his bishop becomes kind of trapped. Okay. If we take on b6 by the way he takes our rook, so we have to take okay. So let's try to trap his bishop here and in order to trap his bishop uh. We need to make sure that the pawn on b4 is safely protected. How can we safely protect that pawn yeah? We can go c5. We also, incidentally, create the threat of knight c6 okay, so he finds a really really good move um, but hmm, okay, let's go queen to a6. Let's swing the queen around. Let's first swing the queen around and then we'll go knight c6. He potentially can tuck his bishop away like this, but let's see if he does that yeah. This is where these people have actually become incredibly good yeah. He finds a way to get out of this now he's attacking the pawn now he's attacking the pawn. We need to defend it, let's defend it with our queen and then we can try to centralize our knight with knight to d4. Let's see if he allows us to do that. Perhaps okay well glad glad you have so knight c4 doesn't actually work. How do we prepare an it4? Ah, but he wants this. Now, let's go rookie. Let's, let's occupy the file. Let's occupy the file. Let's not let him go rook, a1, okay, b3 or c. So we could play b3, but then he goes for b1 and then he attacks the pawn, which is not a pleasant outcome. So let's ignore this: let's ignore this and let's uh, let's try to double on the a file. Let's try to double on the eightfold. I'm gonna have to play a little bit faster guys because I'm very low on time, so, let's uh, let's play a little bit faster, but what I'm trying to do here is jogging for position. Oh and blended one. Now this guy is like a absolute beast. This guy is an absolute monster. Um he's he's playing like one here, I'm basically trying to jock you for a position on the queen side. I've actually wanted a pawn here. He's refuted that flawlessly and um. This is getting very complicated. Okay, so that's another super annoying move. Yeah, honestly he's completely outplayed me here, so I'm just losing in this position: well, not losing, but now I'm going to try to get my knight to e6 and I'm gonna try to get that knight around to f4. Ultimately, no these guys are like insane. Honestly, okay, I'm gonna have to play f6 to defend the pawn on e5 yeah. I need to be focusing a little bit, but I mean I'm still winning most games pretty handily, but some sometimes these guys are like incredible. Sometimes these guys are like absolutely incredibly strong, not like 2 300.. I'm not expecting them to be weak, but you know I actually kind of have forgotten how good these people are so knight. F6 is a really good move here. For example, the the problem is uh. He he's he's just too slow he's he's taking like five seconds for a move here, but he's finding absolute best moves like every move. Uh he's just gonna, not probably I hope, not make it here, so we're going to get the knight to see one and attack the spawn rook b. Oh my god, he might make me there. I think he might have had mate. Actually, okay, we're gonna, give him a check. Okay here, to stop the king's progression. Let's get the night out out of the way, yeah okay, so that wasn't great um again to give you guys a sense. The accuracy in this game very bad yeah my mind was bad. It was 92.6 for my opponent 74.2 for us, so not not one of my best games um, but you know really good play by my opponent honestly. Well again: well, let's not speculate um. I think he played like a gm but but he played legitimately so he found some incredibly strong ideas all right, so basically, okay, no, but his opening was incredibly good. So basically, this move b4 is super strong, and this is actually a very thematic breakthrough in this line. Well, I would say this: I think my opponent played on a gm level throughout the game, not just not just in the opening uh or not just in the end of the game, but he outplayed me from a position where I thought that black was close to winning. He found a way to get his bishop out, so it was really back and forth. So thematic thematic comes from the word theme and when I talk about a thematic idea, um I'm talking about an idea that commonly occurs in this type of position, maybe not specifically in this position, although I'm sure probably it has, but it occurs commonly in these types of positions. In fact, I could make a chess-based search as I'm peeing I'm going to let chess base do its work and I promise that I will find for you guys several grandmaster game examples of exactly this concept. Uh in in grand master games. That's really what I mean from by thematic here is literally uh dvora's 2440 falling into the same exact, well kind of trap. Okay, you guys can see knight c4, okay, he goes f6 and uh. I played queen c7 in this exact position, but f6 b4 aba5- and this is like literally the exact same thing- happens, it's it's semen, but a different one, um and, and he he crushes the guy. He crushes the guy uh, basically, the whole queen side explodes and he plays uh a brilliant, brilliant game. I plays a brilliant game: okay, uh anyways, I just okay. Now I know what people are focusing on. I made a mistake: choosing this guy, not the 500 others um. So I should have realized that, but basically that's one example of why this is uh. Thematic. Crucial mistake right, so you guys can see that this is literally the same thing. A takes before a5 and um if c takes b4, then bishop takes b6 and bishop takes a5. The problem here is that this pawn on b6 is the culprit. The pawn on b6 is a backward pawn, which means that if there is a white pawn that gets to it, things start to collapse here, and this is exactly what happens if b5, it's all good guys, then knight b6 and you attack the rook and then bishop takes c5 comes and white takes this pawn. Black's position collapses completely. I hope that makes sense, so I decided to take, but after bishop takes c5 thanks for a good night with the tier one, um black is up upon answer for cha with the two one. It's hard for me to like explain this verbally, but even though black is currently up upon. My position is on the verge of collapsing, because white's got all these moves and all these other pawns are really weak. In fact, white is even threatening to take on before, and you can't take back because the rook on 8 is hanging. So a lot of people were suggesting f5. But you know this is like starting another fire there's already so many fires burning and you're starting another fire in the center of the board. Black will not be able to sustain this move. Thank you, the dead rooster for the tier one. If that makes sense. So, for example, bishop takes v4 is good here or bishop d6 and bishop takes e5 rooting out the bishop and um. Well, I do a position search basically, and so this position is super concerning that's why I got my bishop out and now my opponent played really weirdly knight v6 is super weird um. I think bishop d6 is probably the most sensible and and then just taking on e5. I'm not sure what white is better here but um. You know, but but white restores material equality and now the bishop is not going to be good, so you know so that would have been good, but my opponent played this, which I mean I guess it made sense in the end and um it's interesting, but it keeps me with an extra pawn. Now I go rook d8. He goes rookie one and now I miss the super five head maneuver, which I actually saw, but I thought that I wasn't in a hurry and I should have been now this bishop on e6 is a bit of a problem piece. It has no good like roll, it's not really doing anything. It's just sort of sitting there and um. We could have actually employed it. We could have actually led it to a square where it's doing something, but it involves a really really nice maneuver. Could somebody spot it like seeing? This is no easy task. Really. Bishop c4 is right. Bishop c4, bishop b5 and then the bishop is putting pressure on the knight and the reason that matters is because if the knight ever moves, then a4 becomes a possibility pushing that pawn that pass spawn. So this idea I saw, but I decided to play h6 first, just improving the position. Unfortunately, he goes queen c1 and now bishop c4 is no longer possible because there's no more pin okay and now he he starts out playing bishop e3 is super good vacating that square for the knight. So we drop the queen back in order to defend the bishop, but now he takes and goes bishop b6 and amazingly after rook d8 rook a5, like I thought I was trapping his bishop, but this knight d2 move is super annoying. This knight, d2 move is super annoying. He gets his knight to c4 and the knight will support the bishop and I didn't see a good way to do to do to travel. I didn't see a good way to trap the bishop, absolutely man awesome. So basically, I didn't see a good way to trap the bishop, because the bishop has this square. The bishop has this square and basically uh. I played queen a6. This is the mistake I should have kept the queen here gone here. I saw I heard about that and it's very important to be flexible. I didn't practice what I preached. I didn't practice. What I preached and what I preached is that um, you have to be very flexible in the way that you think about certain things. So, for example, okay, you've come to terms with the fact that you can't trap the bishop right. The bishop is not going to get trapped because it has this hiding square. Okay, that's not a problem. Let's go knight t4, let's improve the position of the knight and maybe break through with b3. So instead I stubbornly tried to pursue the bishop, and my opponent got it to d6. Now the bishop is perfectly safe and guess what now he gets his queen to b2 and he can go c3. He starts breaking through and my position starts to collapse. So I accidentally blundered this pawn on top of that and um. You know and okay guys, but maybe we can discuss the game uh for now, so don't go chasing waterfalls exactly I'll play that song afterward. Now I'm down upon, and my opponent played this perfectly- I mean the end. Game was really bad for me. He outplayed me further and uh. It's all good and and rookie rook v8 here would have been absolutely devastating. Actually because there is no defense against this mate. If, if g5, then he takes f5 and he covers the g6 square. So really my big mistake. I think it's somewhere in the opening. I went wrong, but then not going bishop c4 and then like not being flexible, being very stubborn trying to pursue this bishop and letting my opponent, you know basically gain the upper hand over me rather than just saying. Okay, I'm not going to trap the bishop, I'm just going to get my knight to a good square and uh, you know come hell or high water, basically [Music]. You.
