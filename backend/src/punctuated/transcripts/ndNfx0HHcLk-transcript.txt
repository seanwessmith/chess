98.3 98.4 for me, though, ain't that easy to beat a gm. Ladies and gentlemen, it was 98.4 to 98.3. So this was some high high accuracy chester, all right [Music]. We will play one to d4, which is a move that I focused on a little bit less in the speed run but uh. I will now begin to play my real repertoire. I will play the jabal london guys, which you have hopefully, if you've seen my stream. You know that this is okay, so he goes e6 now part of the issue with the jabba london is that black and play e6, and this essentially compels white to do what? What does white essentially have to do here? Sorry board is not visible, yes, uh. What is this? What does white essentially have to do here? Oh sorry, that's weird! That should not be that's weird, guys, sorry, yeah, okay, what should white essentially do here, so the movie four right white has to transpose to the french. My bad and uh black also has to transpose the bench now. There's many lines here in the knight c3 french that I can recommend, there's e5. We will play bishop g5, which is the second main line. I don't particularly know this line of the french. I've always played the tarash after the game. I will explain some of the subtleties here. He goes d takes d4, we go knight takes d4. Of course the knight is untouchable. Due to the pin and now bishop b7 and knight pd7 are black's. Two main moves knight bd7 um. Now we don't need to move this knight, yet we can just continue our development with knight f3. This is all very normal french stuff, and you guys can see that you know we have slightly better control of the center white is slightly better. White's got the pawn on d4 and and black's got the pawn on e6, so white's marginally, better due to my control of the center, but it's really nothing major, because black has no targets in his position. Now we have to take on f6 notice that he's played bishop e7, so he's eradicated the pin, and now we have to decide where we're going to put this bishop. Where do you guys think that I should put the bishop on f1? In the meantime, I'm going to write down that? I should give you guys an overview, so bishop d3. Definitely we should put it on d3, because black is going to castle in in the event of that, the bishop is going to be nicely aimed at the general vicinity of the kingside castle castle. This I'm sure has occurred before and generally black at some point goes to five. So what what would be a good idea here he's gone bishop d7 a little bit of a passive move? How can we tighten the screws straight away in the center? What can we do here? This move is sort of a very typical move, centralizing a piece and the move is 95.. Take up the space, stop him from improving his bishop and potentially vacate the f3 square for the queen of hitch. Okay, h6, no problem, bishop h4 no need to take the knight. We can keep the pressure going and um. You know I meant okay, bishop a4, that's a bit of a weird move and first things: first: does it threaten queen takes d4? Is that a threat? Do we need to defend against that explicitly or can we make a general improving move and if we can make a general improving move? What is that general improving move? Yes, we don't have to defend against it, because you guys already know bishop h7 check, and so we can play rookie one bringing the rook onto an open file, and I love how many people are suggesting automatically this move at some point. We can chase away the bishop with b3, but that's not. I don't see what this bishop is doing like big whoop. It's pinning us on this file like on this diagonal like big deal. Okay. So what now do we take the bishop, or do we keep the bishops on the board? What do you guys think and both is fine, yeah I'll I'll, make it lots of lonely, so I'm actually going to keep the bishops, and I don't think that objectively there's much of a difference, but it's just kind of my style to keep more pieces on the board. When you have an even trade, you can trade or you cannot trade. I like to keep more pieces on the board, because it gives me more chances to attack okay. Now he goes bishop before see he harasses this rook. The tempting move is to go rookie four, but after the game, I'll show that this runs into the very nasty move, f5 uh, so we're just going to move the rook up one square and let me just write this down because rookie four seemed like a very tempting rook lift, but it actually wasn't okay. So now he wants to probably put the knight on before, so we can play a3 to stop him. B3 would run into a knight fork on c3. So you know, knight b4, isn't really a threat because we have bishop b4 in response to that, we're just going to continue making marginal improvements to my position, I'm going to unpin myself so that I can later play b3. If I wanted to and the queen sort of aims itself generally at the king side, he takes we take with the bishop centralizing our bishop. He probably wants something like this very you know strange play by black, but he's not doing anything horribly wrong. What do we do now? Um? I want to chase away this knight fact. One fact two, I'm a little bit concerned about the move, knight b4 in response to c4 um, but should I be concerned, probably not because then I just have bishop a4, okay um! Ladies and gentlemen, am I hallucinating here I'm going to pour myself something clearly, the idea of a3 was so powerful that he simply decided not to continue battle. Nice win perfect, I mean the accuracy was probably 100 too see soggy. That's why you gifted me 20 sips for games like these. This is why you guys all watch the speedrun 95. I mean he was 93.4. Black is just slightly worse here. The amazing thing is how many people have done that against you, but let's not stop this from extracting the lessons from this game. So the move knight, c3, guys um the jabba london- is what move in this position. What move in this position have I played about 80 80 000 times? I can give you the exact number of online games. Oh my god, 10 bucks from frank sinatra, real frank sinatra. I never thought I would be up at 1. 30 am reading and setting a chess book, but with you and charlie's motivation, 15 hours of puzzles later, I'm reading a chess book at 1. 30 am thank you for everything you do. You deserve everything so far and much more. Thank you, frank, the real frank sinatra for the ten dollars and for the very sweet message. Uh, bishop f4. Let me tell you guys using a little-known website called opening tree, expand this. So this is opening tree. This is a great website. You can. You can actually look at all of your all of your games, um and, and you can filter them by opening and stuff. So it's really good. It's a good site, little known site, yeah, it's a great site! Look at this over 2000 guys, it's gonna get to 2200., it's free, you can load your games and you can load my games in 2300 anyways enough. You guys get the point. This is my bread and freaking butter. This opening is my bread and butter. Now. Why do I like this opening so much now it's normally called the jabba london. Now let me give you guys a little bit of chess history. Let me give you guys a little bit of just history. First and foremost, the move knight c3 in this position. The moon, knight c3 in this position, is considered and has always been considered quite bad. Why? Why does this move uh? You know elicit such repulsion really in many people's uh opinions, because it blocks the c pawn and why are you playing d4 if you're not gonna play c4 you're like combining e4 and d4, but in recent years? All of these sort of how should I put it? These dogmatic principles have been completely reevaluated and the traditional varusov is bishop g5 in this position. So the first time that this occurred was in 1889 by a famous player named isidor gunsberg and his opponent here played e6. They had transposed them to the french, which is what we had on the board but uh. The varasov has never really caught on black and played bishop f5 and it restricts your cpun, but with the jabal london white essentially is going after several ideas here which taken together, allow this to work. The first is that knight b5 is actually a very serious idea. Now you guys might look at this life, I think, is hey. Are you serious daniel? This I mean knight a6 just defends the pawn. What are you trying to go for? Well, that knight on a6 is very out of place, and now I actually can move the pawn to c4, so this can be kind of like a souped-up queen's gambit. But the second idea is that after bishop f5 does anybody know how white, usually you know, sort of gets things going on the king's side here? This is a very unusual idea, yeah, so f3 and now a move that would have made like wilhelm stein. It's cringe, okay, more than cringe, laugh me off the board, g4 and h4 and case in point. This position first occurred in the year 1995, the first person to play this was a hungarian fm in 1995. That is nothing. Nobody had played this before nobody thought of doing this, and so nowadays we can get away with this and I've had this position a million times as well white gets this pressure going, and this gets very, very interesting positions, anyways just a little bit of an overview. If you want a sideline that has tricks that will teach you about playing unorthodox positions, I highly recommend the job of london. I have a couple of students who play it full-time over the board. I've been a couple gm's with it over the board as well. Okay, so in the game he plays the move, knight f6 and he plays z6. That's one of the downsides is you have to be ready to transpose to the french? Because if you play bishop f4, then that kind of allows bishop b4 and that's kind of unpleasant. So you kind of have to do this, and so bishop g5 is normal. There should be a d take c4 knight takes c4, knight, bd7, knight, f3, we're just developing our pieces, and black gets a very, very solid position. Right takes f6 notice that we can't just nonchalantly develop, because now black has unpinned himself, so we play knight, f6, bishop d3, castles, castles and it's kind of like a karo khan set up now in this position. I'm just checking really quickly what the theory is, because I'm curious myself. So this is all normal. This should be seven. I mean you get this, these kinds of structures and many openings exactly yeah. So this is over a thousand games. Um actually knight takes f6 is a little bit less common. Bishop d3 is the main line. No, it's still very common castles, main move, castle's main move and uh in this position. Let's take a look. B6 is the main line, so normally people do try to deal with this bishop, but they do it by fianchettoing. The problem with bishop d7 is that deploying the bishop like this allows 95 and white is better. 10 games have gone this way and uh white has just better place pieces more control of the center and unfortunately, he resigned before things could end could get interesting. The only thing I wanted to talk to you guys about is sort of this moment. How do you decide between taking on e7 and dropping the bishop back to g3? Well, I would say that the difference between them is pretty small, but generally speaking, um, you know when you've got more space. It's a good idea to keep pieces on the board, and you might look at this bishop and say well what is it doing? Um? Well, it's guarding the f4 square and it's supporting the knight, as I always say, the pieces, not all pieces have to be doing something very specific. All of the time yeah like no country for old men flip a coin anywhere, but you poke it anywhere. So yeah queen takes c7 here and maybe his queen can come to d4. So I decided to to not do that and uh here I decided not to play rookie 4 because it would have it would have allowed f5, and this bishop on g3 would have gotten him in very big trouble. So I decided to move the rook up to e2. So why did I go queen c1 and not queen d2 um? I actually don't really know I kind of missed windy too. Honestly yeah. I just kind of escaped my attention, guys um. I I think I might have been worried about this move, but I can just go c3. That's not a problem, so yeah, queen e2, would have been more accurate and, of course here just when I was about to play a3, to bring the square under control and then play c4 with an advantage, but not with a big one um computer gives the computer does give plus 1.5, though I mean the two bishops, combined with the way that they are aimed, gives white a very, very good position, so he decided to resign. Yeah or juba does stream as well yeah, so rookie four uh is a very automatic move right. Oh, let's lift the rook up, but after f5 you're all of a sudden in trouble, because if you move the rook back then f4 and that bishop is actually trapped. So does that make sense to everybody like the way that this game not not a spectacular game? We can play another one, but a couple of instructive things. What database is called megabase? It's part of chess space, all right great next game. Let's play one more five minute and then we'll do some 10 minutes yeah some. Sometimes things like this happen: yeah rook h4. He can still go up four, though I think okay, thanks again guys for all of the support in the early going. This means so very much to me um. I would I usually draw the threshold at 1800. I think, if you're like 1800 2000 and above you could definitely benefit from chess space, but really leeches has all of the tools that you would need honestly. So I don't know I'm kind of on the fence about it. Okay, I don't think we had a stream sniper. It looks like there might not be too many opponents at this high level because they play three minute at a high rating. Let me open the window. It's a beautiful early morning, nice and crisp 30 degree morning in the south. This is tea, loose leaf tea. All right, we got it. We got an opponent. Okay, let's go e4 this time very serious guy 2467 from georgia. Georgian players are good. We're at that russian school of chess north carolina is the south come on okay and let's play I'm gonna play my real openings guys. So my main opening is the right lopez and the overlay is messed up. I don't believe it is. Is it messed up? I mean the clocks are a little bit messed up. I'm sorry about that. Well, it's less south than south carolina can't see the opponent. Oh crap, sorry, one second guys yep! I got it all right. What is wrong here so where is this sorry? Give me a second please. This happens sometimes yeah there we go all right now. You should be able to see the opponent and uh. What is this called? He plays the berlin, he plays the berlin and I will once again play what I usually okay. No, he doesn't play the ball. He plays d6, that's uh, sort of the deferred steinitz and black uh creates the thread of knight takes c4. What should we do here with white there's a couple of ways that we can play this position, but you guys should have a good finger on the pulse of how I like to play it. So I like to yeah so rookie one is one possibility, but I like to strike immediately in the center when my opponent plays passively, I like to open the position up and we open the position up in the rye lopez by going d4 and taking with the knight. Obviously, if he takes knight takes c4, then we can take twice on c6. Now. Uh is a moment where people already struggle uh, you don't actually need to take on c6. We can just wait this out and and develop our knight to c3. If black plays knight takes d4, which is actually quite typical in these positions, then I will take his bishop and deploy my queen to d4 all right now. Uh, let's pay attention to a couple of things. First of all, this tension right, we can take on c6 and a lot of people actually do if we were to take on c6. What would we want to take with? This is a tricky question, the knight of the bishop, because if you apply like standard opening principles, you would think well. The position is open, so I'd want to preserve the bishop, but the reality is taking with the knight is worse, and part of the reason is that when we take with the knight he recaptures with the pawn with tempo, we have to move the bishop here. Take a very good hard look at this knight that knight has a lot of prospects and it can potentially go to f5. How do we prepare knight, f5 and with this next move, we're not only going to prepare knight five, but that's going to be part of the idea. How do we make sure that, after knight f5 bishop takes f5, we don't have to take with a pawn which is kind of awkward? What should we do? Don't be afraid to move that? Lady guys, absolutely don't be afraid to move that lady and the other threat that we're creating, and this is actually an inaccuracy. I have fallen into this myself with black. Does anybody else see what it is that we can do in addition to knight fun, take a look at this type, 2 undefended pawn? Ladies and gentlemen, do you see that the queen is x-raying it? Do you see that the knight is putting pressure on it? Boom go e5 ruins black's, pawn structure even further. It opens up, and I have to speed up a little bit now. Look at black's pawns, all isolated, weak, our queen is beautiful. White is better here. This is all theory. By the way and uh do we want to trade queens? No we're going to drop our queen back to c4 so that it continues to pressure. The c7 pawn. Okay, rook beat is a great move. It stops our bishop from developing because then he would take one. How do we resolve such a problem, and this is this is still definitely within the balance of theory? How do we resolve that problem in the simplest possible way? We can play the move b3 right, we can cement the pawn he can play. Rook b4 we'll drop our queen back to e2, not a problem, okay, queen d4. So I guess we now have a dilemma right. We can take the queen that slightly corrects this pawn structure, I'm actually going to make a move which a lot of people will find objectionable. I'm going to play bishop e3, and I know you guys, might look at this and say well. Why are you ruining your own pawn structure, I'll, explain this in detail after the game we have less than two minutes, but the bottom line is: is this idea of knight t5 here allows me now to correct my pawn structure and once again, I think, get an advantage in the end game, whether or not I will convert it is another question. This guy is really good, so we are going to have to be super precise. I'm going to take this pawn on a7 to create a passer on a2. The reason that I'm optimistic here is because I do have a pass spawn and black does not yet have a pass spawn. You guys already know that when you're looking at an end game, you want to pay attention first and foremost to well other than the material who's got the past pawns okay. So he decides not to take this pawn all right, so we're going to defend it. Then we are going to defend it with our rook and if he goes f4, then we can redeploy the bishop through c1 to b2. I hope this is making sense. So far, now, let's play the move. F3 uh since he's given us the chance I'm going to meet f4 now with bishop f2. Okay, he's gone. Okay! Eight, though that's a good move yeah, I have to say this: guy is not bending at all. This guy is not bending to my will at all. Let's go rook d3 just to shift the rook up to c3. This might end in a draw, although we'll see, I might also lose this one. Okay, let's go here: okay, five! That's a bit of an odd move! Okay, let's go! Let's do one yeah, I'm getting that sense that I'm I'm getting soundly outplayed here, rook c6! I want to push this pawn up. Okay, let's push that pawn up to c5, hmm, okay, let's go here and now. If he takes my pawn, I'm gonna move my king away and then I want to take this one of course f4. This is really interesting: stuff, okay, okay, this is um f4, really riley tvs. Thank you all right guys. I hate to be that guy, but okay, so bishop d2, I think, might hold the draw here, although by the hair on my chinny chin, chin. Okay thinking here, you see not a huge fan of the time he's spending on these obvious moves. But, okay, no we'll look at the game, I'm not suspicious, but he is very strong. This is gonna end in a draw. If I'm careful, okay, he might if he plays around like this he's going to lose, but he's not going to play around like this. Well, basically, I'm going to try to push this pawn to d7 11 january yeah. I don't know guys I'm going to torture him a little. What is this wow? King e7? That's just that's some serious business right there yeah! Something is off he's taking like five seconds on only moves, but this will be a draw. I will try to flag him and basically the reason I will try to flag him, ladies and gentlemen, is because he is taking five seconds for every single move. So if I can play a couple free moves and check him, that's the bottom line. I can pre-move this and I can make up a lot of time in the five seconds he's spending per move. F3 I mean f3 would be played instantly by most people, but I will not make any direct accusations we'll review the game he's also not playing this perfectly. Like he's, he's definitely going to draw this, but he's making it a little harder himself, as you guys can see, it's definitely weird just the way he's playing this I mean, but okay well still a very instructive game, no doubt about it. Thank you temper. I mean you guys see what I'm saying right, I'm not being unreasonable here. Hopefully I'm not being too unreasonable. It's it's the five seconds for every single move and their fluctuation between certain moves are really good and other moves are just really bad one. Two three: four: it's every every single move, and this is a repetition of moves, there's nothing I can do here. I mean, unless I I mean I can try to do something like this and just flag him. This is a little distasteful, but because I'm pretty convinced that he is up to something you can count it like a metronome, it's literally four seconds per every single move, one two three four boom one: it's a metronome put on the metronome two three four five boom I mean he's going to I mean this is unreal, I'm going to flag him, I mean what do you? What what am I expected to do in such a situation? This is uh. This is actually hilarious, that he doesn't realize he's going to flag he's got less time and that's it. Maybe it's his internet, but I don't think so. Yeah, I'm sorry guys, sorry for the flagging. But if it's someone like this, you know this is just ridiculous and now he's played fast. He played one move fast, yeah goodbye, good, bye, okay, that is some very, very sketchy play all right, 98.3 98.4. For me, though, ain't that easy to beat a gm. Ladies and gentlemen, it was 98.4 to 98.3. So this was some high high accuracy chest here all right. Now it's hard to win this position, though that's the reason it ended. In a draw I mean I didn't make any mistakes, I didn't make any big mistakes um and- and so it was a drawn position before you know before he could really manufacture any chances. Okay. So this is all theory, I'm quite sure of it. Let me just check I mean because it seemed like he equalized very easily, and I don't remember black supposing to equalize this easily one sec. I mean I'm not going to make any claims for sure, but boy was that suspicious play. I mean that that was just some weird stuff going on okay, so this e5 d e yeah 31 games yeah, so queen c6, okay, so queen d6 is correct. That's main line, and now rook b8 is five games. So a couple recent grand master games actually continued exactly like this and now b3 is, is one game from 1999, queen d4 yeah, so we're following one game from 1999 here white took on d4 but um. I decided to play bishop b3. So in this position I think I made a small air um. I played the move b3 and the reason behind this move was very clear, which is to deploy the bishop to e3. That's the ideal square for the bishop, and if I go there immediately, then I just blunder the pawn. The problem is, I forgot that he can bring his queen to d4 and sort of force a queen trait on his terms. So I should have gone rook to d1 should have gone rook to d1 and attacked the queen and then his queen has to move and then maybe I can play b3 um, so he goes queen d4. I go bishop b3 and I made a small misjudgment here. I still thought it was better. The reason I thought I was better is, first of all I'm attacking his pawn, which is something and second of all. I thought this pawn on c4 is a. You know, basically allows my knight to access d5, so I thought eventually, I'm going to play knight t5 and I'm going to correct my pawn structure, which is what happened. I corrected my pawn structure. I no longer have doubled pawns. The problem is, he's got very active pieces right and he deploys the rest of his pieces to very nice squares, and here this move, f5 is fishy. I mean no, I mean I think most humans would take most humans would also not give up. A7 I mean rook. A4 is automatic here for me and um. You know he plays this in this very, very precise way: king f7, he doesn't rush with f4 and ultimately, he you know is able to get a dead drawn position, and now this move, bishop d2, is crucial by the way. So he reached this position and after f4 here's the problem guys. If you play c, takes d6, you might look at this and say: wait. A second d takes c7 and the pawn is unstoppable. It is who can spell out for me the whole line black wins here. Black strikes. First dude, it's got to be an executive order. Thank you, tesco, dude I'll be happy. If there's a special commission dispatch for anti-cheating, I think we can whatever our political beliefs. We can all agree. We need to target justice okay, so I go here boom boom now, normally this is a draw, but here here comes johnny and now I can go rook two and I can also simply take and goodbye to the king, rook g1 um. So that's the bottom line. Why couldn't I take on f4? I could, but then black at least has a draw. Piggy is on the seven black at least there's a draw, and I actually at this point started to flirt with flagging and bishop d2 puts the bishop sort of you know almost shielding it with its body. Rook takes d2 as force uh. If black's bishop moves, then I take on c7 with check and I've got these connected, passers, um and and it's anybody's game, so he takes and um we get this dead drawn rook and four versus rook and four, where eventually, I'm going to give up my pass spawn for one of his pawns, which is what happened, but he he missed with king f6, I mean king f7 is, is just a dead draw. King f6 allows this this little maneuver and I I was able to win a pawn ultimately, so he sacked the spawn, he lost it and I flagged him, but this was all actually top computer moves. Nonetheless, so we did play stockfish, I'm pretty sure guys, I'm going to send in a report, and please do not misinterpret this as me, like 100, saying he's, cheating, but chess.com does have an excellent detection method that they will use, make the appropriate judgment yeah all right, goodbye, um great. So that is the couple of five minute games marred by some weird stuff going on, but hopefully you found them instructive, [Music]. Nonetheless,.
