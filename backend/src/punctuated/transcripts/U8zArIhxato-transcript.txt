Okay, it's too brute now he's playing the bird defense so against the bird. A really good move in this position is actually bishop g4, which is sort of like the trumpowski. Now what is the idea of bishop g4, as in many of these openings, you want to get the bishop outside of the pawn chain before closing things up with e6. Now we're going to develop the knight to d7 and I'll explain why not knight c6 after the game, we take the knight notice that he hasn't developed anything what pawn break do we want to prepare here for black? What is the key pawn break to prepare and can we play it immediately yeah? So we want to play e5 now the sam shanklin question, as I always say, can we play e5 immediately now? A lot of a lot of you are thinking new because of queen 65, but remember, white's made a lot of pond moves near his king, which changes the rules of engagement for the center. So if we play e5 and he takes the pawn, we can deliver a very nasty check on h4 forces, king to move, and then we can castle along we'll have a huge lead in development. His queen will be caught on the crossfire and uh. We've only sacrificed the pawn. So it's very important to always follow through on on this kind of question. He's gone. Bishop b5, pinning our knight, that's why we put it on d7 so that we could play c6 and blunt the bishop's control, also enhancing our control of the center. Now we're just going to continue developing. Let's continue developing. We don't need to do anything about the central tension. We don't need to push by keeping the center open. We are allowing ourselves to exploit our lead in development. Where do we want to put the f8 bishop? Where do we want to put or do we want to develop the bishop? Do we have an even better move? We actually do so. People are right, but we we have a better move. How can I find it? I want everybody to notice that he's played h3 h3 has created a hole on g3, which is something you should notice. What can we put on that hole? We can put a knight there. How can we put a knight there? We can centralize it. This also creates the threat of queen h4, which basically compels him to castle, but that castles right into a fork. We win an exchange and will basically be winning right out of the opening. If he doesn't castle, we can decide between knight g3 and a nasty check on h4, which I just mentioned. So what I want people to understand is that when you're developing your pieces, you don't want to just put your head down and develop automatically. You want to also detect the holes in your opponent's position. Sometimes you can move a piece more than once in the opening if it means that you're exploiting a specific deficiency in your opponent's position. Okay, let's see what he does well, I needed to get more ice cream. Okay, he's made a good move queen h5. Now, let's unpack this move for a second he's, just attacking our knight. If we go knight g3, he takes one knight with check and wins the other one. So let's buttress the d6 knight by playing bishop d6, now sorry, the e5 knight and yet again we're threatening knight g3. I don't see a good defense for him if he castles, then, once again, we go knight g3 notice that the e5 knight, okay, so he's gone here. Now, let's start, let's, let's try to understand what our priorities are in this position. Our number one priority, the move, that's going to devastate him like no other, is if we can manage to put a queen on h4 right. I know a lot of people are looking at discoveries. One way of doing that is to go queen to f6 by threatening the check on f2. We are going to force this queen back and then we're going to relocate our queen to h4. What's another way of trying to get our queen to h4. What's another way of trying to dislodge his queen, let's go queen f6, but I want people in the meantime to think about that question we could have gone. G6 could have gone g6 attacking the queen, forcing it back and then putting our queen on h4. That would have been a little bit more precise. This move is perfectly good enough. Okay, so he ignores the checkmate and the game is over. So that's why I don't recommend these kinds of openings to players even in the intermediate range and we're 1500, so just to emphasize just to emphasize g6 would have attacked his queen if he sticks the queen on h6. Actually, that would have been a little bit nasty. Well now again now we can play queen f6 and he can't even stop us from coming to f2 if he tries to go g4. What move does he now allow? And I'm sure this is not the only win by the way, but but as an example, what move is now possible? We can go knight, f3 and we can take his rook and we're threatening checkmate, that's unstoppable, because he has neglected the development of his king side. Okay, we'll analyze this game later. In the meantime, let's continue next game. Okay, let's go e4 and we have been playing several different openings now. H6 is not a good move, and the reaction that we've had against such moves is to prepare the control of the center with c3, which is what we're going to do here, preparing the move d4 which we're going to play anyway. I don't care that he's got knight, f6 we're just going to control the center. Thank you derp bite for the tier 1., okay. So how do we solve the problem now of the e4 pawn? We have an intermediate move that we can make in order to solve the problem of the e4 pawn by the way we could sacrifice it. That would be fine because we would open the e file for us, and the common approach in this position is to go e5 now here I know a lot of people would rush to say we should take on d4, but let's think about this a little bit deeper. What is the drawback of the move queen e7? The drawback of this move is that it puts the king and the queen on the same file. So we actually now want the e file to be opened and we we want him. In effect to take on e5, because that would set up a skewer, nor do we need to go queen e2. We don't need to defend the spawn. We simply need to prepare for the opening of the e-file by preparing to position a rook on e1, and we do that by killing many birds with one stone we castle in order to save his skin, he's going to have to move his knight from f6 now, and only now do we take on d4 notice that his knight from g4 is now stranded. It has no squares so to add insult to injury, we're going to just win his knight here now he a good player, would play h5, but that doesn't really solve any of the problems inherent in his position. We can still take on g4 by the way in that case, okay. Well now he opens the f file for us now. As I always say, when we win material, the most common mistake that people make is to forget the fundamentals: they forget to complete their development and they run into problems uh. But let's not forget to complete our development. Let's, let's do that, let's put in the time to complete our development, let's go knight to c3 and once he castles, we can also centralize our knight with knight to d5, that's a good move and then develop our bishop pile up on a lot of these weaknesses that he's created on his king side. Thank you, tj rink, for the prime appreciated. My man appreciate it, my man, okay, so let's centralize our night okay. Hopefully this is making sense to people. Another thing that we could consider doing here is to go knight, f6 track and try to take his bishop out of the equation so that his king gets even weaker, but there's no need for such extravagances. We can just pile up on his h6 pawn. This is sort of a classic method of attacking in such positions. Okay, but now the temptation to play knight f6 has been raised because his queen is no longer guarding that square again. What I want to emphasize to people is simplicity like the power of playing in a very simple fashion, so we're actually not going to go knight f6. Even though that's the move, I would have played in a game we're just going to continue with our sort of conventional plan here and only now. Well, okay, so still we're not going to plan out f6. What would be the simple way to accumulate pressure on his king on his king's side, let's say: there's one more piece that we haven't deployed. Yet, let's deploy it, let's deploy, let's deploy the last remaining piece, which is the rook, and I know that this might strike people as a very formulaic way of playing like okay. Where is the checkmate where's the sacrifices, but trust me in order to master dania style, you have to master the fundamentals of attacking which, which is to say the art of bringing all the pieces in very patiently and doing the fundamental things very well, okay, now it's time it's the wax on wax soft method. Now it's time for some tactics, this king on h7 is subject to a discovered attack, sorry to a check by the knight on g5, but this check in and of itself is is a night blunder. He just takes her knight, but it could be used as a discovery down the f file. By combining these two observations, we see the move. Bishop takes f7 distracting his rook onto a square where it can be picked off with the discovery. Now some of you are looking at this and saying: okay, I get it. Why are you giving up two pieces for a rook? Isn't that good for black? Well, no, because look at his king, his king, is now encircled by our pieces. We're still up in exchange on the next move, we're going to take on g5 and basically checkmate him. So how did I see the move? Bishop takes f7. What made me find it it's! The fact that I saw that we have a check on g5, and one of the properties of this check is that it opens up the f file. So if he has something on the f file, that's vulnerable. We can give this check in order to pick it off right. You have to do this kind of observation all the time you have to constantly notice these sorts of things. Otherwise, you're not going to find these types of tactics, and- and you know there were many formative books that that caused me to raise my awareness of this one little known book that I can recommend to people is called chess middle game combinations by peter romanovsky. Originally in russian romanovsky was a early 20th century chess master and he wrote a fantastic book on on seeing tactics so uh. Hopefully, this game made sense to everybody: let's play one more and then we're going to analyze, let's play one more blitz game and then we're going to analyze all three we're going to play: apache same rating as us right now. Okay, so he's playing the sicilian we're going to play the open situation which I've been doing okay, so he plays e5, which is called the kalashnikov variation. It's a pretty common variation of the sicilian and black strikes in the center immediately, but the drawbacks of this move are pretty evident right. The drawbacks of this move are that it weakens these two squares principally square on d6 and square on d5, and we have to maneuver our pieces in order to exploit those, and so knight b5 is the main line here and then we're going to bring up the other knight in order to access d5, the other weak square that has been created. This is all theory. By the way, this is all theory and we have transposed into what's called the ceveshnikov now. What we don't want is for our knight to be easily dislodged from d5. We want to keep this knight on t5, but what's preventing us from doing that, is his knight on f6, so we're going to develop our bishop to eliminate it. Thank you, socrates, now and I'm sort of trying to explain why the theory is a theory. This knight, on a3 everybody should notice, is very misplaced right. It has no prospects. So what we're going to go about doing is giving this knight some prospect, particularly we want to maneuver it to somewhere civilized, so we're gonna go c3 in order to deploy this knight through c2. It's not ideal, but at least our knight is now doing something okay, so this is the main line of the swashnikov. So far, he's been playing all the theoretical moves kudos to him now, the other thing that people should notice here. C4 is also a move by the way, but it would weaken the d4 square, but c4 is a theoretical move as well. The other thing that I want people to notice here is that there's there's a pawn on b5, which is sort of sticking out like a sore thumb. How do we go about undermining or perhaps trying to exploit the weakness of this pawn? It's a very typical idea. You'll see this. Also in the rye lopez. You'll see this in a lot of openings yeah. We go a4 to to try to break up this pawn and also deploy the rook via the a-file. It's always nice when you don't have to move a piece, and it already participates in the game. I have read parts of reassessor chess, although I wouldn't say that I've read the whole thing. Okay, so let's see what he what he comes up with here all right, so I think the theory- maybe he takes the knight here- I don't know then we'll take with a queen and the queen, ably performs the task previously fulfilled by the knight uh. Maybe I should have supported my knight by playing knight c to e3. That's another way of doing it. He takes, and so will we and by taking he's also given our bishop, a very nice square, where, where can our bishop now go to in order to support the knight well and c9? To answer your question, we were waiting for the square to open up for the bishop. Development is not something that should be rushed all the time. It's it's a priority, but you should make sure that you're giving your pieces good squares before before you're developing now he's given up a pawn on a6. I think we're just going to snag that one. If you don't mind, that's a free pawn in my book now there is a little bit of pressure down the a file. We should be careful about that, particularly because this rook is unprotected, but what I'm seeing is that I can later move my bishop back to b5, that bishop is going to simultaneously defend the rook on a4. So while this is something to keep an eye on, it's not something to be overly concerned about okay, so he takes we take. As we know. I don't really see where he's going with this, I don't really see he could have taken with a rook. But again I don't see a point to shy away from this tension. I don't see even how he attacks this bishop another time and even if he does, we have many ways to defend it. We can defend it with our queen, which is what we're going to do we're going to drop the queen back in order to lend some additional support to this bishop. This guy is good, though he's he's not going down without a fight, but you can see that the cracks are beginning to show okay and now is a great time to show why we've deployed this knight to c2. There's a there's, a move here that I call a glue move, there's a move that glues together all of the disparate parts of white's position. It stops the queen from attacking b2. It lends further support at the bishop and it just glues everything together very nicely. That's the move knight to b4, as some of you are pointing out. This is a glue move. This guy is good. As I said, this guy is very good. He's underrated, but white is definitely better here. Okay, b2 was also hanging out. That's important. F2 is not hanging because it's simply protected by the king. Let's see what he comes up with here. Okay, now we have. We have time for a simple prophylaxis. What is the point of this move? Where is the knight going? How do we stop it from getting there two questions? Let's answer them, both the knight's going to f4. Obviously, how do we prevent it by going g3 right? This is simple prophylaxis. A good observation is that d5 square is also free. We don't want to rush putting our knight there remember that the knight on b4 is fulfilling the crucial role of defending b2 thanks. Okay, he's gone back excellent. Now we can complete our development by castling. Okay, so he's gone f5 now you know a lot of people would be worried about this move. Oh my god he's opening the file, but let's take a second and understand the drawbacks inherent in this move. What is the drawback of pushing the f-pawn when you're castled? One of them is that you, by definition, weaken this diagonal? So what we need to notice here is that this check on c4 might be very strong in a couple of moves. Let's take on f5, let's. If he takes back we're gonna make a discover check and his knight is gonna be lost. I think he's noticed that so he's gonna have to give away another pawn. He can't recapture on f5 well, he did, but this knight is defended by the rook. This rook also defends the other rook, which means it's overloaded. By giving the check, we are exposing the tension of the rooks boom and boom and we're up a night and we're up a pawn and we're winning. So the the most important moment in the game was g3. This made him frustrated. It made him frustrated. He got impatient trying to create counter play and he fell apart very very quickly. Now he realizes it, but it's too late. Okay, let's capture the knight and now, by the way, if you notice the bishop and the queen, they can combine in a battery threaten checkmate, and the bishop on f6 is going to be lost as well, because to defend against it. He's got to give it up. Okay, the art of attacking the king, I'm not sure what book that's referring to. Okay, he runs we're going to take it. How do we continue harassing the king after it moves to f7? Which piece can we deploy to attack the king, and how can we deploy it also notice, by the way the move, knight t5, could potentially be a fork. Yeah, bishop, c4 or bishop g6 are both good now. Our goal here is to get the king onto e7, because that is a forkable square, so we need to kind of assess all of the checks that we can make here, including retreating moves in such positions. People often misretreating moves and they are the art they are the glue that makes the attack run. The bishop on g6 is cutting the king off from f7, as many of you are seeing good job guys queen h3 forces the king onto e7, that is literally the only move and that king walks right into the fork with the knight we won this queen and we won the game. So the game is over good, very, very good, okay and um. You can see that we didn't do anything extraordinary. We played the theoretical moves and he collapses quite quickly, so very good kelly from sales gifting five subs to the community stoke in the fire really really appreciate that um legendary matrix gianlucille kendall jc one temper all getting subs. Thank you! So much and 34.77 boys and girls, incredible um, really big fan of the glue metaphors. I, like blue, moves, okay, so let's um, which I think we actually explained the games quite well. I don't think there needs to be any over explaining to do, but let's just look at this game for a second now, okay, so boom. This is all very simple. Now the move c4 here some people were suggesting is also very fashionable, theoretically uh, but the issue is that it weakens the d4 square, so that move does have a drawback. Its strength is that you, you get your development out faster, because c4 occurs with tempo. You, you attack the pawn on b5 simultaneously. I made a lot of night moves in the early going. I did, but he also made a lot of concessions which allowed me to violate some of these rules. In particular, he weakened the square on d5 and when you get to that level of 1500, you have to understand that these rules that you, that you follow in a very linear fashion, when you're a beginner, you start to bend them very slowly and one of the rules you start to bend uh is that you? You know you um you. You can allow yourself to move the same piece more than once, because opening theory starts playing a pretty big role and modern opening theory involves a lot of violation of of rules if that makes sense, so it's sort of a negotiation between continuing to follow principles but understanding when to violate them. At the same time, yeah, let's check the oh, so somebody said we had high accuracy in this game. Let's see I'm curious now people were supplying the move, so I didn't do much yeah 99, let's go so simple rules. Simple logic produces good chess, okay, um! Well, every people were supplying the most to me. I wasn't really doing much. Okay must be cheating, that's right. Let's continue, though, one more pow mondatto 1577 and let's once again play the situation in the accelerated dragon, which is the opening that I recommend to people in the 1500 range. This is a move. We've seen often knight takes c6, it's a mistake because he gives us greater mobility in the center greater ease of organizing d5. Now we have some problems to solve. The rook is hanging, which means we should develop our knight and defend the rook at the same time, yeah. This is a theoretical line where they can go e6 and it seems like a lot is going on. Oh my god have we blundered, he's discovering the attack on the rook in reality, this is one of those lines where, if you look a little bit deeper, you find the black is doing completely fine because remember he doesn't have anything out yet so we're just gonna go f6 to block the queen's attack on the rook. I know I said never play f6, but there's a reason why this is an exception and I'll explain that in greater depth after the game. Now, one of the reasons why f6 is okay here is because the move f6 prepares, what central advance. What central advance is now possible with tempo because we played f6 yeah. The movie five is now possible. Thank you. T brown 03 for the prime yeah. This is now possible and um. Not only is this possible, but this is really good, because we open up the bishop as well, and where should we put this bishop, we can put it on d6, for example, we can also deploy our queen to b6, so it's actually staring at some pawns and potentially it's also permitting us to play bishop e6 to lend some support on this weakened diagonal. That's exactly what we're going to do here in order to support this knight on d5. Hopefully this makes sense. Okay, now what should we take with and both both recaptures are fine, but but according to sort of our way of thinking, let's take with a pawn um. Here we go with this again, let's take with a pawn, because now we have, we have a really nice pawn center, we're going to castle to attack up to defend f6 we're going to castle to defend f6, okay, bishop h6, so it seems like he's tossing us around, but he's actually not uh he's just sort of he's making these moves that look active, but the reality is. We have control over the center um. He has these two pieces that don't really do anything they're just sort of sitting there, because our king's side is perfectly well defended. Where should we put our rook? Let's? Well, we don't need to play g5. We don't need to kick his queen away from a square where it's already not doing much: okay, c4! Okay! Now we can take on c4 and make a weakness or we can push d4 and we can expand our central control, which is what we're going to do and then one idea is to play. F5 and well. G5 does strap the bishop, but you've got to be careful about weakening your own king, okay, now well, there's a couple of ways to approach this position. We want to play e4. We can't do that yet so the simplest way to approach this position would be the simplest way to approach this position be just to play f5 and prepare e4. It's a little bit risky to introduce some more weaknesses in our king side, but there's just no way that he can exploit them. There's just no way that he can exploit them and um. Let's see what he ends up doing, but e4 d3 is just a massive threat yeah. He doesn't actually stop us from playing e4, that's partially, why we positioned our queen on b6 that it guards d4 and allows us to prepare d3, okay, how he could exploit it yeah, maybe after the game yeah, we could have also played a5 to sort of slow down the progression of his pawns, but there's no need for that. Yet all right, let's continue our pawn storm, no need to no need to stop okay. So there are some tactics here takes takes rook to e3 yeah. So this is where this is, where the tactics come in and the concrete calculation comes in. So we have two ways to capture. We can capture this bishop or we could capture this bishop. The move that we should start with is the move that may yield the most benefits if it works, which is d takes e2 attacking the rook has to go to d2 and in that position those of you who want to practice their visualization. What is the move after d takes e2 rookie 2 to harass that rook and force material losses? The move is going to be e3 right because if he takes e3 we're going to fork his king and his rook, this is where concreteness transcends general appearances. It looks like why are we partying? Okay? So he gives up the bishop straight away without a fight. Now we're up a piece, and now the win is very straightforward. We can, let's put our rook on a good square, on an open file, and now we can go go about playing down the d file. We can triple on the d file and then focus on putting a rook on d1, which is going to be the simplest strategy and um we're in great shape here we're in great shape here and uh the royal triple, but we would move our queen away from d6 in order to set up the possibility of putting a rook on d1, okay, yeah load up alakine's gun, that's also possible. Okay, here comes ellicott gun the queen isn't doing anything and um. This is not made because he takes and he goes rookie one. So we should be careful about that, but we can we can trade queens. How can we force the trade of queens? How can we force the trade of queens? It was not made before either because he could have gone rookie one? No, no, it was not made guys. I did not miss mate because queen d1 he has rookie one immediately. It's not made guys. I saw that trust me. I'm not! I'm not gonna miss a back rank mate like this. So this forces the trade of queens, because if his queen leaves the rook, then we simply take his rook and why is it good to trade queens here, because we have control over a file, uh and and okay? Now we're gonna play e3 just uh cement this past pawn. We can play f4 later yeah. So now we're gonna go rook d1 he's gotta go rookie, one, otherwise he's checkmated. Now it's a good idea to do this because we trade, rooks and we've got to be a little bit careful. Our top priority is to is to support the pawn on e3, so we're going to go g5, okay, we're going to carve out some real estate here. We're going gonna go after this pawn and our secondary idea is to position the rook behind the pass pawn in order to preserve it. Okay, let's move our bishop to f7 so that we can meet king f3 with bishop h5 check and dislodge the king from the pawn. Also that bishop is going to guard the e2 square, so we're going to be able to push our pawn to e2. I mean I'm not really explaining my moves here on a granular level, because there's many ways of winning such a position and I'm just making pretty straightforward moves. Okay, he's good, though, he's he's playing resiliently, and in order to win this, we need to involve our king. So let's go king g7 also if he goes h4 it's checkmate, which is kind of funny, he actually might go h4. Thank you, john cena, appreciate it glad you're enjoying it this all most of this will be on youtube. I don't put every single speedrun game on youtube, because that would be cumbersome. Now we go h6. How should we follow up after king h4? What should we do? What should we do? We should take take on f4 step back to e4 and then we have connected passers. Then we have connected passers, okay, we're not going to let his rook take we're going to go bishop, h5 and um yeah. Now it's very simple because the bishop has been charged with control of the pawn. We can just move the rook to d1 and uh. We can force the trade of rooks and then finally we can grind okay, so he takes that's fine. Rook b1 takes and now we can just push our pawn forward. That's fine! I wonder who's going to win the ponderers. We actually have to be careful, f2 c7. We can't stop this pawn. Of course, that would still be completely winning. But we've got to be careful about that. Okay, we can give up this pawn and win the other one. It really doesn't matter just go around. He should resign, he should resign yeah and he does okay great. That was an interesting game. Um. Let me see so I think one of the keys to the kingdom here was this move. F6 uh, you know you always say never play f6, but f6 does create certain weaknesses on our king side, but, on the other hand, uh it. It supports the building of a center, and this is one of those other things I mentioned about weighing the pros and cons of a particular move and deciding that, because he doesn't have enough stuff developed, we can get away with something like this okay, so it's it's always important to weigh the pros and cons of everything that you're doing, particularly the move f6. So here we just can complete our development. The queen b6 deploys our queen onto a really nice square. What also makes this move good is the fact that he cannot put his bishop on e3, because that square is protected and um yeah we're in fantastic shape. Here now we put the other bishop on e6. We don't want to give away the knight on d5, that's our strongest piece and um, basically that that that was what won us the game. I think yeah and then then we just prepared the pawn storm, and then we found the tactics. If you've gone rook two in this position we would have gone e3 and uh he's in huge trouble because his rook well, I guess he has rook t4, maybe, but that then maybe we play up four actually and then again we separate his queen from his rook. So this is just very, very good good position for us. We could have also taken the other bishop and and and kept our pawn chain, but this is sort of place to the concept of transformation of the advantage uh, so anyways guys, [Music].
