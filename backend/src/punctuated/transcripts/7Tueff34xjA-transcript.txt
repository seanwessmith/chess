[Music] do instead it's totally fine to actually just take the pawn and uh. Then we can complete our development and try to get that knight to d5 let's castle, how can we try to get the knight to d5? Could somebody chart for me a course that this knight could potentially take to land eventually on d5 second question: how is bishop g4 often met? What move do we like to play in these situations, because it's just a helpful move and it forces him to sort of commit? Yes h3. So, first of all, let's make some luft for the king, as many of you guys are saying. 92 would blunder the bishop, but the idea is knight a3, knight, c4 and knight e3 and through e3, that's frankford airport. That's where you can fly to all the good european destinations, but before you can fly to european destinations, you have to pass the airport security airport security's knight on f6, which controls d5. How do we hypothetically get rid of that knight, and I probably maybe should have played this move first uh, but we don't really have to get rid of the knight, but how could we get rid of the knight bingo, the smithslav idea? I've shown that game a million times bishop to g5. Let's make this move first, because if I didn't play it he'd probably go h6 okay. What should we do now? Do we take? Do we drop it back? Are you paying attention to what I just said? If, yes, then you should yeah knight c4, guess what we're trying to get the knight over to d5. That's literally, what I'm trying to do. There's also a very nice tactical detail which he may allow us to demonstrate. If he plays v5 okay, he doesn't now. There is a problem with knight e3. What we need to notice here, ladies and gentlemen, is that the d3 bishop is a type uh two undefended piece and it's defended by the queen. The queen is overloaded. So if knight e3 that severs the connection between f3 and d3, he can take on f3 and ruin the bishop. A ruin ruin the bishop. He can ruin the bishop but ruin the pawn structure is what I meant to say. So what should we do? Yeah so g4 is possible, but it kind of weakens the king side guys what we actually can do here, and this is something which is sort of not unique to a high level. You shouldn't be afraid to trade queens, to accomplish what you want. The d5 square is still a sexy outpost in the event of an end game that doesn't change uh. So what bishop e2 accomplishes is now we don't have to worry about this knight being captured. Finally, we are ready to go to d5 and he prevents us from going to d5, but in doing so he gets kind of passive. Now, let's deal with this standoff, I'm tired of this standoff. So I'm going to go knight to d2 because uh, I'm just tired of him, constantly hanging this over my head and we are going to deal with this knight on e7. What this creates is a situation where he is quite passive. Okay, so he wants to take on e3 there's not much. I can do to to stop him and I should now I want to get this other knight to c4 the problem with knight c4. Is that he's going to play b5 and chase away the knight? Can I prepare knight c4? How can I prepare knight c4? We can play a4. This is a kind of a king's indian idea. I have to say this. Guy is also playing tremendously well he's playing on a 2600 level, so I'm trying my best to nurture my positional advantage, but uh this guy is is super super strong. What should we take with? What should we take with? We should actually take with the knight exactly because now we have access to the square. His knight is basically a slave to this square. The queen can take the knights place on c4, so this knight on e7 is pretty immobilized as soon as it moves well as soon as it moves we're going to stick our knight on d5 and we're actually threatening a four which he misses and uh the moment the knight comes to d5. We basically win the game. This isn't the entire story, because once he moves his king, how much material do we actually win here? Should we even take his queen? Let's do some calculation, that's actually pretty poetic, I have to say- and I am going to disable the alerts during the speed run. Yeah we get the exchange we take on c6 we take on z8 now a lot of people here would notice the pawn on b2 and they would probably go b3, but we don't actually have to go b3. We have an even better move. Remember that when you are up in exchange taking off a pair of rooks would be essentially squarely in a favor, but actually wait. A second on second thought guys. I am wrong because if rook d1 he is going to take his rook and then he's going to snap off the pawn on b2 and what I missed is that he's also going to be forking the a pawn. So, let's, actually we will go b3 because he wins just a little too many pawns there and I'm afraid that, even in the event of a rook trade, we won't have any puns left. So you know: okay, knight, a5. Now that uh knight takes b3 doesn't actually come with a fork. Uh we can go ahead and play rook to d1 rook after d1 would also be fine. Now if he takes on b3 yeah, so he goes here. How should we follow up uh? We have now gained the defile, but we need to squeeze the most out of that d file by playing rook to d7. We are making contact with this type 2 undefended pawn. The knight is protecting it, which means that b4 is a good move, but let's instead start just taking all of his pawns. Here's one pawn, here's another one. We are now up upon end of the exchange and our ultimate long-term plan. If he allows it if he doesn't go rook to d8, if he does uh, we will deal with that. But where should this work? Go yeah piggy's on the seventh stack up that seventh ring. That is such a typical endgame idea, and it's such a strong one, because we are going to win this fun. We are going to win the game: okay, um, so pretty smooth and a nice positional game, so d6 he kind of pre-moved. I don't think he expected c3 uh, and this gives white a very nice center we've sort of talked about this. Now at this level, you can see that these guys, they they um, they make very reasonable moves right. Uh at an earlier rating c takes d4 was often the move that uh that was played against us, hey montana chess and, as you guys know, the problem with this is it gives the b1 knight this e3 square, it's very cooperative at this level. You know they strike in the center. They don't back down, knight f3, knight, c6, and I I take on c5. So the key, the key property of this position that gives white that slight but stable advantage is that d5 square, which is going to be a perpetual weakness. There is no equivalent weakness on d4 because I have a pawn on c3. That's protecting that um. So, ultimately, here is where I charted the chorus for the knight knight, a3, knight, c4 and 93 knight d5. Now you guys might look at this and say: well, that's like four moves. I've talked about the three move rule, which is a good way to estimate whether an idea you have is realistic. If it takes three moves or longer, I often claim that the idea is unrealistic, but you need to take that with a very serious grain of salt, I'm not saying that I'm literally putting my head down and I'm going to make these moves in succession. What I'm talking about is an ultimate goal, not a plan where I make one move after the other move, regardless of what he does. So what we see in practice is I play knight a3. Then I play bishop g5 and take his knight out right. Then I play knight c4. I don't even play 93 I'm making these moves uh in a very measured fashion, so knight, e3, bishop takes f3, allow or forces me to play gf and and ruin my structure uh by the way the nice detail. If he goes b5 this may seem very nasty because, after knight, e3 uh, what move does he now have? So if you've been paying attention to what I just said, not c4 c4 is not dangerous guys before he's, not dangerous, don't make a move just because it threatens a piece all right. I don't want to see that bishop b2, you know better c4 is tempting, don't fall for temptation. In fact, this becomes a very weak pawn chain, uh, which white can undermine with a4 undermining the b5 pawn. The move is bishop takes f3, and here white has a very sexy response. What's uh, how do we find this move? We put on our sam shanklin hats, our sam glen, hats tell us well. If a move is impossible, we first ask ourselves what happens if I do it anyway? What happens if I do it anyway? You must ask yourself that question. You must allow yourself to look at certain positions and if you look at those positions- and you have a better chance of not ruling stuff out instinctually play tao for president- you play queen f3 anyway, b5 pawn blocks the pathway back of the queen rook 81 traps the queen look at that. So I saw that, which is why knight c4 was justified and the queen is trapped. Black is busted. If he goes knight c4, you can simply take the knight and nothing has changed so anyways, that's what would have happened if b5 now, you might ask well what's why can't we do this anyway here? Well, the pawn is on b7, which means the queen can escape. So it's very important not to generalize. That's why we played bishop b2 and I think black probably should have gone for the end game. I think the end game would have lessened to blacks load a little bit queen c7 93 97. I asked myself what happens if I do it anyway, it only takes one second. My claim to you guys is that once you consider queen f3 and you look at this position, you don't need a grand master to find rook 81. Okay, everybody can see rock81 uh, given this position, it's just a matter of so I would divide tactical difficulty into two different categories. Category one is like stuff that is hard to. Let me let me think about how to formulate this category. One is stuff that is hard to calculate, so it's a move that everybody sees like a sacrifice, but it leads to very chaotic, uh contin, at least to a very chaotic continuation, and you have to calculate that and it's hard category two are things that are hard to see, but not hard to calculate. It's like a venn diagram, okay, hard to calculate r to see, and then there's middle of the venn diagram, which is both and that's the kinds of problems that grandmaster solved. This is easy to calculate but very hard to see. There's actually basically nothing to calculate, and you have to try to train both of these skills if that makes sense. Okay, so bishop b2, knight e3, now we go knight d2 a4 to prepare knight, c4 white is slightly better, there's nothing huge about white's advantage, but it's an unpleasant position and he finally buckles. This is my point. When you apply pressure on your opponent for so long he's going to buckle, rook d2 would be a good move. Forcing me to play the relatively passive rook, b1 and black should be able to hold a draw with a couple of accurate moves. This is probably already close to equal, um and uh. He plays knight c8, allowing knight d5 here. What should black have done instead of knight b6? Well, how do I determine who is better? Basically, the position is symmetrical with the exception of the d5 square, so white's slightly better chess dojo live another raid 59 welcome everybody. We are doing this speed, run yeah, rookie or uh. You could also play king ha. Another two category thing is: a threat can be dealt with by removing the symptoms or by removing the cause or ki removes the symptoms. Right e7 is defended, but king h8 would remove the cause. I actually prefer this move. You often want to remove the cause, because rookie 8 actually basically ties down your rook to a passive existence of that, although in this particular case it doesn't really matter and then black can play knight, p6 to trade, the knights off or knight d6 to chase the queen away. Instead, of course, knight knight, uh, c8 knight b6 is a blunder, it doesn't drop the queen, but it does drop the exchange and the rest is very, very straightforward. Any questions that was a pretty straightforward game. Uh our opponent was good, but you know we didn't do anything. We didn't reinvent the wheel. Just uh sort of typical rudimentary positional principles were uh. Rehearsed looks like everybody is pretty clear on what we did excellent. Let's continue. Okay, jimmy fallon won 2400. Okay, so let's go e4. Let's go e4! This guy is good. E5. Okay! So here we're going to play my real openings. I am going to play the rye lopez. Now I'm going to play my real openings, I mean because this these guys are serious uh. So so I'm going to play my real openings. Okay, so d6 is fine. That is called the steinitz variation and white should not particularly change the way that I play uh. We already know that well, d6 creates a pin. So from a logical perspective. What would be a good way to exploit that pin would be to open up the position with what move. We know that the right lopez there's two main ways to play. We can play c3 to prepare d4, but the immediate d4 is also perfectly good, and after e takes d4 knight takes d4. We exploit the fact that the knight can move now. A very good move in this position is actually to take the knight. This is a hard move to understand. You guys might be like wait. A minute, isn't the whole the whole point to like leave the night there and after the game, I'll explain the rationale behind this move. Basically, this softens up the e5 pawn so uh it eventually, if I play this correctly, will force black into taking on d4 and yielding a lot of the center, so I'm going to castle if he takes on e4, he opens up the e file and I'm going to get a big initiative uh once that bishop appears on e4 okay, so I'm going to take it. He does take anyway, okay, and how do we very simple move? How do we attack this bishop and make a general improving move? Remember that we can take on e5 later to reclaim the pawn, but we don't need to rush with that. We play rookie one and now the thing is we're attacking this pawn and we're we're pinning him. I feel, like white, is better here. Okay, so we have several things that we can take. It's like a buffet um. What should we capture here? What should we start by capturing and there are several possibilities, but the e5 pawn isn't going anywhere, because my advice to you guys see here, I think a lot of you guys are falling into a slightly faulty pattern of thinking. This is the pawn I actually want to capture, because e5 is not going anywhere. He is not going to play e takes d4 because that disastrously opens up the e file, and so now we can play d takes e5. Obviously, I'm not going to take again because of the back rank mate, but the reason why it is better here is because his pawn structure on the queen side is quite ruined and my pieces are very active, but we have to be very careful about how we follow this up. If we play bishop e3 mindlessly developing the bishop, we allow rook b8 and he wins the b2 pawn. So one possibility is to fianchetto with b3, but that weakens all of these dark squares. I don't really want to do that. The other thing that we can do in such positions is is, of course, just to move move the queen uh we're going to move it to a nice centralized location we are also threatening to take on e5 white is slightly better, I'm not winning, but I have a very pleasant position. Let's speed up our pace of play a little bit, then we can develop our bishop and bring a rook into the game again. I I hope that people are more or less understanding my play, I'm not doing anything crazy, okay, so rook beat is a good move. Um. If I guess what he's trying to do is bait me into taking the pawn, what does black have in the event of queen takes e5 this pawn is actually kind of like an umbrella or it's a it's. A barricade that is separating his pieces from from mine. He's got bishop f6 and his bishop opens up the b coupon is lost. I don't want to allow any of that, so I actually well b3. He maybe has bishop to b4 and then bishop to c3 driving the bishop in so what I'm going to do here is go c3. I am going to control the b4 square, so his row can't go there and I'm also going to reinforce the thread of queen takes e5, because once I take- and he goes, bishop f6- the bishop as we know, is biting on granite yeah. I'm not sure why he allows me to take, but I'm just going to call his bluff here and now I'm just going to be up a pawn in the end game. Let's see if I can convert it into a win uh queen takes c5 this. The queen d6 was a bad move, because now he well, he can't avoid the queen trait. Actually he can move his queen away, but he doesn't uh. So rook takes c5 rookie, that's a good move, he's he's heading for d1 and we need to be careful because if we move the bishop out once again, he has bishop f6 uh, the rook has to move and, and then rook takes. B2 comes with great effect, so we shouldn't panic here. We we simply need to target the cause of the threat right. We can go king f1, that's a nice way to defend against rook d1. If rook d1 check, we simply drop a rook back and we're going to do that anyway, to stop rook t1 and we're fine for the time being. What's challenging here about white's position is untangling our queen side. If we untangle our queen side, we are going to be not completely winning, but we're going to be well on the way to winning the game. So rook b1 is one idea to open up the bishop. What is the problem with rook b1 yeah? We should have gone rookie. Two we're actually going yeah bishop takes e3, so we're actually going to try rookie two here, and the point of this is of course to bring the bishop out if he goes rookie one check which he should do. But let's see if he finds this, then I'm going to come back to e1. I'm just asking him to find this one move and then we repeat the position and I'm going to try to find an alternate method, but right now he's not playing rook d1. So maybe he's hesitating for whatever reason. If anything yeah, he does go rook to d1. So we have to, unfortunately, repeat the position and um I'm going to show you a five-head idea. If he drops his rook back, which he probably will because training rooks is in white's favor, we are up a pawn, I'm going to show you guys prepare for a five-head idea. Oh he takes okay. So that is a little bit odd to me. What I think he's trying to do here is what he's trying to say is now I can't get the bishop out, but what he has forgotten is that I now have a little piece called a king and the king can get stuff done. It absolutely can get stuff done. What do I mean by that? How can it get stuff done? Where can the king go uh in the name of liberating the bishop from c1? The king, of course, goes to this nice little c2 square. Then the bishop comes out. Finally, we can complete our development. We can bring the rook out and we can convert our extra pawn. We do not need to defend h2 because of the move. G3 bobby fischer, boris baskey, but at the same time, in okay, we'll go rook to at some point. I want to move that h-bond, because I don't want to keep having to deal with this. This is something that a lot of people don't understand like. Why are you defending the pawn if you just said he can't take it? Yes, he can't take it, but does it make sense that I don't want to have to deal with this all the time so now a4? What this move accomplishes? Is it fixes the weakness the pawn on a5 is on a dark square. I want you guys to pay very careful attention to that and guess what he now allows us to exploit this weakness in textbook fashion. What should we do? Should we take the rook and if we do take the rook, why what will be our follow-up yeah? Of course we take the rook and we have bishop b6. That is why we played a4 the pawn is immobilized and he has a terrible choice. He can go. Bishop c7 and the pawn end game is, of course, completely lost, but so is the bishop end game. I'm gonna be up two pawns both of them on the queen side of the game is over, so he really collapsed here quite quickly. Um, okay, so takes on on a5. He's probably gonna go here and try to corner my bishop, but the bishop has an escape route via b4. Okay, now uh the win is a very, very simple matter of pushing pushing my pawns but uh. You always hear the advice be patient in the end game. What that really means is you want to make all the necessary improvements? First, what kind of improvement can you make before pushing the pawns so like yeah? So let's bring the king out first, so the king can supervise the progress of the pawns. We don't need to worry about the king side, because the pawns are symmetrical. We need to watch for a pawn break, but by and large we don't need to do anything now. Even we even here we can make an improvement before pushing the pawns up. We can reposition this bishop to which square yeah bishop b4 bishop c5 is right. Bishop b4, bishop c5 is right, and only then, when all of these necessary improvements have been made, did you guys not see me play bullet against min 30 seconds is an eternity folks, you are in the hands of a professional everybody. Take a deep breath. We are. We will be just fine trust me on this one. We will be just fine. We go king c5 to force him to take the pawn. Then we are going to reposition our king to d5 and finally, we are going to bring the other pawn up to c4 c5 c6 and we are going to win. Do not try this okay, so I should have taken the pawn, but it doesn't matter because everything is protected, just don't pre-move. We can actually pre-move c6 check because it is a check, but that is the only thing we do not pre-move bc app or tampering with v6, and now we can transition into a pawn end game. But first, let's play b6. Now it's important here to notice the bishop on f4, okay, bishop c7 bc check and now we bring our king in and we are going to cause zugzwang and the game is over so f4 we can just immobilize his fonts first. That's fine! Also, okay check! Now what move should we make in this position? How do we cop? How do we force zooxvon? What do we do? Okay, we move the bishop yeah good job. I just wanted one person to answer this now. What I'm going to do is I'm going to move the bishop to g5 in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate. That's actually a very important little trick right just make sure the bishop doesn't control any possible squares. Okay, are you guys a little bit convinced that everything was under control? Yeah, we're fine uh it it's cosmetically close, but it really isn't close. I I know how much time I need to and what you guys need to understand is I've played for so long that I know how much time I need to win these positions. I know that I'm going to win this with an abundance of time on my clock, I'm not trying to rub it in anyone's face okay. So this was a rye lopez and the first kind of surprising move is bishop takes c6 right, but I think it actually isn't as surprising as I'm making it out to be. We are simply weakening the e5 pawn we're trying to get him to take on d4, which of course gives me a much better slice of the center okay and- and this is just a super active position uh once he goes knight f6, you can get this bishop out to g5 white is slightly better. That's just bottom line. What we're aiming for here is a slightly better position. Oh my god, and there we go jer jerky sminion with 20. Are you kidding me in astral 96, throwing in a sub there? My lands girl, the 4 am hype. Is unreal? 4 20 gifted sums by jerky simon kgb operative, throwing in his sub as well, and we are on the way back to magic. Thank you so much appreciate it. Jerky simon uh, you're, the man and and the damn girl. Also. So thank you. Thank you appreciate it. Okay, so uh once this happens, he goes knight f6 and we castle. Does this part of the game make sense, guys we're actually kind of semi sacrificing the fun for an initiative right? We are pushing him around he's, not developed. So I know that I'm going to win back the pawn worst comes to worst. This is not you know, I'm not taking a big risk here or I'm sacrificing a pawn. Oh my god ruling snow. I know that I'm going to win back e5, okay, so bishop takes f3 queen takes f3 bishop b7. Now a lot of you guys wanted to take on e5 and there is a well this might transpose into the game if he castles I can take on b7. This is literally the game position. However, there was a move that deterred me from playing d takes e5 specifically. Could anybody tell me what move? I am referring to? It's just a concrete thing right, the move, d5 and he intercepts my queen's access to b7 and he keeps the position closed. We do not want the position to be closed because we have the initiative. Maybe I can play e6 here but um. How can black respond to this position on the topic of not panicking keep a cool head? When you see a move like this, because sometimes you don't really have to do anything crazy at all. Thank you. Jared lefty look at these subs. That's what we like to see. We just castle because we simultaneously defend the pawn and black is completely fine here. In fact, black might be better after c6, okay. So that's the reason I didn't play de I took on b7 and uh. Well, e takes d4 is horrible for a variety of reasons. Um king russo asks what, if he played f4 when the bishop was on e4, that's a great question. If he had played f5 ding ding ding, ding, ding ding. This sets the alarm bells off in my head, because this weakens his king side even further and guess what he's not? He hasn't developed his bishop. So if I can get this bishop out of e4, then I'm gonna have a direct artery to his king. That's not going to end well for for uh for black, so knight g5 is a typical attacking move and um, and now I can I can take on e5- and this just looks I mean this looks absolutely devastating. Um well quicker, wrote in in which position can he take on d4? Because his bishop is hanging here? And here he's pinned so he he never could capture on d4. Oh, oh you mean here yeah. So so this opens up the e5. I mean this move looks good um. Although he's got f6 there, you can give a check force the king back. I mean why can't just do nothing at all. Just develop his pieces and I've got full compensation. Thank you. Derpy ebola for the tier one, okay, whoops, sorry, my bad, so he castles we take and we drop the queen back to e4. Okay, we drop the queen back to e4, centralizing it getting it out of the line of fire of the rook and now uh the calm stage of the game. We go c3 uh in order to protect the b4 square and the d4 square. This pawn is is kind of a nice nice little pawn and the follow-up move would have probably been to play b3 and then developing the bishop. So queen d6 is a big mistake. He just I think he forgot the pawn was hanging. He should have defended it. He should have played bishop f6 or whatever bishop d6. He should have defended the pawn and then he makes another mistake by trading queens black is a very clever way of avoiding the queen trade here. Who can tell me what it is? I mentioned it during the game, but I didn't say a specific move. The way that you need to find this specific move is once again to realize that when the bishop is on, c1 white needs to worry about the back rank, okay, um, and what that means is. You could also think of the rook on e1 being a type 2 undefended piece, so the queen could just slide on over to c6. In fact, even queen d7 is good and that's a vicious trap, because after rookie a black wins the queen, you cannot move the queen due to back rank checkmate. That is why um, if you have a chance to play a move like h3 in certain positions, that's a good idea because of tactics like these. Does that make sense, so he should have at least kept the queens on the board so takes takes. This uh brings the game into an end game. We go king f1 to prepare rookie one against rook d1 um. Now the five head move, if he didn't trade brooks okay, so let's say that he would have brought his rook back to d8 repeating the position. Let me guide you guys through I'm not saying this is an amazing move. I'm just saying it's a nice idea. It's an elegant idea! Now the bottom line is, I want to move the bishop out fact, one! Let's bring everybody on board with the fact that we want to bring. Does that make sense? The reason I want to bring the bishop out is because I need to complete my development to win this game now. We have already determined that defending the pawn on b2 opens up. Another tactic with bishop takes c3 and you cannot move the bishop out directly because you drop b2 and then you drop c3, etc. So the question I ask myself is: do I have any other methods of defending the b2 pawn so that I can bring the bishop out? We already know that rookie 2 has been tried and it failed to the check. So that's where this idea comes from, you just need to apply some creativity. Thong me look at you, okay, who else can find well? King e2. The problem is the king can't walk to c2 because there's a force field on the d file. B3 doesn't work because it drops c3 a4 is the correct move, but the idea is to put the rook on a2. That is the ultimate idea: rook a2. In order to liberate the bishop. Okay, you can put the rook on a2. Now, isn't the rook passive there? I hear you guys a little cringe horrible temporarily, the rook's not going to stay on a2. Eventually, I'm going to find a way to once the bishop moves out, I'm going to have the resources necessary to somehow defend the pawn again and then free up the rook, but it's all about the priorities here. It's okay to make an ugly looking move as long as you are fulfilling a priority. Well, a4 gives the rook a little bit more space. Maybe you'll need the a3 square. That's all there is to it: okay, um! So that's the bottom line idea I can swear. I saw a game like this um. I can swear that I saw a a uh, a game like this before and in general um. This notion of of defending something uh in order to in order to move a piece out of the way is a a relatively common trope. Actually, oh, I do remember the game. Let me just find the game that I'm referencing here. I recently gave uh to my students a problem. It's it's a completely different position, but it's a similar concept that I think some of you guys should file away in your sort of um mental rolodex of positional ideas, the notion of wanting to play a move and not being able to play it because something is going to be hanging right. Some pawn is going to be left hanging, for example, and so you simply um you make a contract with one of your pieces and you say: look peace, look, rook, look knight! I am going to force you to do something unglamorous, but I promise um, eventually you're going to be freed from this task once we do what we need to do. Okay, here's a good example of that and this this dovetails back into another concept of static versus dynamic uh concepts in chess, something that is dynamic, is temporary and likely to change. Something that is static is likely to stay. The same piece placement is generally quite dynamic. You can change the way. A piece uh sits on the board pretty quickly, so you don't need to worry about a piece being passive uh for a short duration of time. That's that's! That's! Okay, okay, so this position right, anderson against vagany and anderson, one of the strongest positional players of all time. Now, when we look at this position, who is better and why uh we are looking at it from white's perspective, so well white is better. Why is white better? What are the weaknesses of black's position? Simple question, I'm not looking for any any rocket science answers. Just look at the position, I'm looking for two things very specifically and you guys got one after the other, so the d5 hole and, as so often happens, the d6 pawn is also weak backward pawn and the space in front of it. Now there is a problem: we have a way to occupy this square and that is to play knight d5. How should we attack this one if we wanted to attack the pawn on d6? What seems to be a pretty obvious way to immediately threaten that pawn? Well, e5 just blunders the pawn yeah knight, b5 bishop f4 blunt is the bishop knight controls the square knight b5. There is a problem with both of these moves, both the moves, knight, b5 and knight d5 run into the same problem. What is that problem? Not a hard question guys just look at the position. Yeah b2 is hanging, and so anderson said. Aha, okay, wait a second! I need to defend b2 but wait whoa whoa! I know a lot of you are going to start thinking b3. This is the 2200 move. B3 is a good move, but that's not the grand master old anderson move. The grand master move is while you are at it. You prepare another idea and the move beautiful, rook, c2, rook c2 is a very strong positional move. Why is it so good because you're simultaneously defending the pawn of two and you are also preparing to move the rook onto d2, not insane, but very nice idea, and the funny thing is uh vaganyon played a6 to stop knight b5 anderson played rook, d2 and vaganyan played knight d4 to plug the hole on the defile and anderson, actually just sacks the exchange, because he's got a pawn for the exchange and this pawn is going to fall. It falls on the next move, he's got two puns for the exchange and the knight comes into d5. White's got a massive position and you won the game in the end. Okay. So a couple of lessons here and and the second among them is that when you have an idea, you want to try to find the best execution for it. The best execution often involves preparing with the prophylactic move, also an active idea. Um. Would you be worried about bishop c3? No, because that gives away the fiance bishop and the pawn on c3 a great example of double pawns. Being good covers the d4 square. So literally, you cannot defend d6 you're, just busted here. Does that make sense uh? So that's an echo of the concept we applied in in in the speedrun game, of course completely different. But hopefully you can see the similarity um okay, so he he goes. He he took the rook, which is just bad, and now we get the king to c2 same idea. Free up the bishop and the rest is very simple. I mean he shouldn't have gone rook d7 that accelerates his defeat completely overblown if he did not go rook d7. What would be the plan of victory in this position? And we have discussed this time and time again in these kinds of end games. We simply need to identify uh the potential to create a past pawn, and then we need to find the best way to do it. We have two good ways to create this past fun, the best well, bishop d4, I'm actually not a huge fan of because this bishop on e3 guys is a huge asset. This bishop on e3 could not only help create a past pawn, but it could also help attack this pawn. So I like bishop c5 to prepare b4 also, this bishop paves the way for the pawn, because once the pawn reaches a6, hey bishop's, going to cover that a7 square and we're going to be able to play a 7. trading more pieces is not always good. That is the point I have made from the very beginning of my speed run the fact that um, the fact that, okay, when you're up a pawn or up a piece most trades, are going to be good, but once you've traded down to an end game do not just blindly continue to continue to trade um. You see what I'm saying here. Peace can often be super valuable, okay, um and after rook d7 we take, we win the pawn and the game is over. If he he had done. Bishop c7, then we've simply take and go before completely winning pawn end game. Any questions about this game. We played many more moves, but he could have resigned here. We made all of oh that's from goodwill honda. We we made all of the necessary improvements and we pushed the pawn how about them. Apples, okay eugene looks like what is the best defense against the rue lopez yeah. The berlin is good. A6 is the main move, and then you get the main line with knight, f6 and bishop b7. That's sort of the I've won about when he brought the rook to absolutely mr boyd, I'm all ears, mr boyd. He brought the rook down in this position. I mean he brought the rook down several times. I assume you mean here uh. What's the question? Oh there we go. Could he have brought the other rook? Oh? Could he have brought the other rook to defend? Yes, he could have that's, not a bad move, but the thing is, I can just move my bishop out and the rook on d1 is now under fire from both rooks, which means that he must now either or get off the pot, both of which are perfectly good scenarios uh. If he takes the rook, then we do what we want. If he moves the rook away, then that's that's great as well. I think that's a good expression to capture to capture the situation. Blackstroke is in um, anyways [Music].
