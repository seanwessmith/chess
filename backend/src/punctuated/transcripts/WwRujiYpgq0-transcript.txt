And let's play the sicilian: let's play the sicilian alert me now: it's f4, so f4 is a line and the way to respond correctly to the move. F4 is to open up the center immediately with the move, d5 [Music] and the rationale behind that is. We already know that a 4 is quite a weakening move. Now, how should we respond to the movie five and I'll disable the alerts just for now? How should we respond to e5? What is the drawback of this move? What what square does it allow one of our pieces now to access so knight c6, of course, is normal, but but I want a specific square that now is accessible to one of our pieces. Yeah right, that's the f5 square, so we will go knight c6, but in on the next move. Well, actually- and this is why flexibility is where bishop g4 would also be good, but let's get our bishop to f5 because that's kind of what I promised nice little, you know hole in the wall italian because cuisine, you know good spot. I don't know why. I said that, but f5 is a good square. Okay, this guy just disconnected uh. This move was so powerful. He reconnected. Now he wants to go d4 and link up his central pawns. Can we prevent that? Can we prevent the move d4 in in in some way yeah we can play d4 ourselves and guess what? Because he's played f4 rather than develop to peace, we can afford to take this kind of liberty. A lot of people are asking. How do you know when to violate opening principles and when to push a lot of pawns? Well, the reason the thing is he's violating principles, so we can afford to take some liberties. Now, let's develop our pieces, let's go e6 to potentially open up the square for the bishop. Now we have an interesting situation. We have an interesting situation where, if we develop the bishop to e7, the knight will have nowhere to go, develop the knight to e7. The bishop will have nowhere to go. How do we solve that problem? We solved that problem by moving one of these pieces twice. Does anybody want to offer any sherlock holmes types in the chow and offer solution to this problem that we have pro tishka? Thank you for the tier one. Where should we keep well fianchetto? I will explain why it's bad fianchetto is actually bad, because the bishop will basically be biting on granite on g7, exactly knight, d7, knight, t5 or knight to g6. Both moves are good knight. D5 is better because it's centralized and if he goes c4 that knight can stick itself on e3, forcing him to give up a very important bishop and in turn that's going to open up another outpost, the d4 outpost for r9, that's if he plays c4, so zen0 314, another prime sub. Thank you. Now we're going to develop our bishop yep, let's go to e3, take stakes, and now this knight, okay, can we go knight? D4 does knight d4 blunder the pawn on e3 and for the record, even sacrificing this pawn would be worth it. Given the squares that we get, but can we go knight, d4 nope? Why not? Because we have knight c2 and that's why it's bad to have an undeveloped queen side, because this kind of stuff happens when you don't develop one side of the board and you weaken a lot of squares. Okay, he goes knight c3. Instead, he tries to keep the tension. What should we do here? How should we? How should we resolve this entire situation? Now? First of all, a non-stupid idea would be to just develop our pieces, and I mentioned this right keeping the tension because he still cannot take on e3 due to knight c2, but we can also make a far more concrete approach to the position by winning material. How can we do that? How can we win material here with black identifying his weakness on d3? Bishop takes d3 is impossible, but what can we do? First, we can. Of course we can simply take the bishop and it's very it's going to be very important to take with a queen. If we think with a bishop here, he can take e3 and then he can quickly put a rook under him. So this not only wins the pawn, but this kills. The coordination of his pieces, thank you for the knight which he just blundered and the queen is perfectly safe because we put a bishop on f5, okay. Now, how do we? Actually? How do we proceed here? Well, we there's several ways we can play. What what's the simplest move? Do we actually need to really do anything here? Uh. The answer is obviously no, that's a rhetorical question. So what would be the most zen move ever we could check on f2, but what would be the most zen move ever there should be seven yeah. I just want to show you guys that this kind of in your face play just develop your pieces, no need to for anything fancy just develop he's not threatening anything. We have the uh that's right castle. I kind of allowed this, but uh. That's not scary at all. We could just defend the bishop now. Well, we have a choice. We can give a check um and let's actually do that, because the queen always has an evacuation route via vsc2, and it's going to be very important here. Remember what I always say when you're up a lot of material do not cling to individual pawns. I know a lot of you want to play e2, but e2 is actually a dangerous move because he can potentially try to win the spawn and the queen could get trapped on f2. So instead e as rosev, very good, I'm just gonna go rook fda, I'm gonna say all right. Take my pawn be my guest, but once he takes the pawn we're just going to double on the d file and we're basically just going to crush him down that file, we don't need this pawn anymore. It's served its purpose. It's outlived its time now. Should we trade queens here we can. We can also play queen, takes p2, let's trade, queens in the interest of simplicity, because we already have our rooks poised to get onto the d file. Let's stop him from going g4. You can see that I'm stopping and time to infiltrate with rook, t3 and now uh there's many ways of winning this position by the way. It's a good idea to fix his king side pawns, so he never can play g4 due to a non-passant, and now we can win the game again in several different ways: let's see what he does he, while he disconnected, he seems to having you having internet problems. Yeah rook, c3 c2 is an idea that I had in mind. We can try to relocate one of the rooks to the second rank and we can try to put the other rook on d3 and then a lot of tactics will emerge. Okay, he disconnects, but he's already completely lost um, so yeah. So after g4 we would take on f3, but like I'm talking about in the future, if this rook ever moves away, we would also stop him from going g4. So a very simple game. We can go over it quickly, so by the way, if they take on d5 here, a good idea is to go knight to f6 trying to take the pawn on your own terms, and this is actually a gambit, because how can white defend the d5 pawn yeah I'll answer all questions in sequence, so we will go over the game. If you have a question about the end game, please wait until we are at that stage of the analysis, to ask the question to keep the flow now for extra credit uh. How what should black do here? What should black do here and and after this correct move, is stated yes e6? Can somebody explain to me why it is that black has not only full compensation for the pawn, but black is probably actually better in this position? Why is that there's three reasons. Three very specific reasons that can be identified here. Number one is development. We have a lot more developments. Number two number two: that development is the sort of obvious pawn structure, but I want you guys to be more specific. Yes, number two is the weakness on f4 right white has pushed his pawn out to f4, which means that if he castles king's side, he will never be completely safe. Well, what is the third thing yeah? So the second thing is that he's created all these weaknesses: yeah and uh. Oh, oh dramaali, mao, pointing out the correct third factor, which is the d4 square. This is a humongous outpost for the knight. You can imagine that if a knight lands on d4- oh that's a juicy juicy central square, okay, and by the way, when I say that a couple of you might be thinking. Well wait a second. How are we going to get a knight on d4 when there is a white knight on f3, but the point isn't that we will get the knight on d4 immediately uh? The point is that this will always be hanging over white like the sword of damocles. The knight ever is gone from f3 or, if it's eliminated, then the knight on d4 will be basically unassailable and I can show you guys many examples of games that go like this, where you weaken a square thinking that, ah it's fine, I have a piece guarding that square. Eventually, that piece is eliminated and uh there is hell to pay as a consequence and to give you guys a very quick, very promise. Very very quick example is a detour, and I like doing this, I think it helps people remember I had. I had a painful experience like this one time exactly like this, where I made this kind of misjudgment thinking that uh one of the the squares I weakened is perfectly well defended by one of my pieces but um yeah. So there we go. Let me just switch scenes one second, and I have to switch to the chess-based scene, all right, yeah and I'll I'll continue the game after that yeah, so uh. This position was from one of my games from 2009 against the grand master. What is the weak square in this position that that is in question and how should white go about occupying that weak square white to play and okay d5 is, of course, the key weakness. What should white do here? Well, d6 is a weak pawn, but whoops. No, so what should I do? Should white immediately put a knight on d5 or should white do something first, so actually no knight d5 is not correct. Bishop g5 is correct and the reason that knight d5 is not correct is because, if you think about it, what's going to happen in the end is that a rook is going to get to d5. But what piece does white actually want on d5? He probably wants a knight on d5 uh here. How can black go about dislodging this rook from d5? That's by the way? Why knights are better um outpost occupiers than rooks, because rooks and queens are easy to kick away like knight before exactly so? What my opponent does is: go bishop g5 and then he takes the knight and then he comes back to c3 and knight d5. Now it is true. I just said that knights are the best outpost occupiers, but this is an exception. Why is this an exception for the very simple reason? First of all, the rook is unassailable, but guess what he does guess what he does boom for extra credit. Does anyone want to tell me where this night is going? Where is the where the hell is this knight eventually going look at this where this thing? Where is this thing going boom boom boom and like clockwork boom? Look at the beauty, beautiful position all of his pieces come into the game and he gets an unassailable, not on d5. Many many moves after that weak uh square was first created. So that's the the power and the danger of creating an outpost like this, because it can. It can define the whole game. Okay, and why is this knight so good, because it's visually, I mean look at it. It's dominating over the whole board and my opponent eventually won. So this was a very good lesson uh for me to to to be very careful about how I go about uh, managing my weaknesses and it's okay to create weaknesses. If you have counterbalancing factors, chess is a game of tit for tat. As I always say, uh, but weak squares, in particular in the center of the board that can be occupied with knights, be very careful about that. Okay back to the speed run. So that's the reason why this sacrifice is kind of fine from a general perspective, so our opponent played e5, which is fine. Bishop f5. This is normal. Developing now d4 is the key move. Uh we could have gone here, but then we would have allowed him to go d4. Actually, this is a good position for black. This is like a good french. If you know what the french looks like and- and comparison is often a good way to evaluate positions by the way, this is, I think, a point that some people miss. You can often make a lot of sense of a position by comparing it. This is the main line of the french advance. Now, literally, we can take this position and compare it side by side to well to this position. The bishop has jumped over the pawn on e6, which is a really good thing. French is a solid opening, so this by definition like by a transitive property, has to be at least quite a bit better than the french and but still we decided to prevent him from doing that. And now, of course, we solve the problem of insufficient space by getting the knight to the center, and then we get it to e3 vacating the d4 square. For the other knight which we occupy win the pawn. Take the free knight develop our pieces, give up the pawn for the greater good double rooks infiltrate, stop his king side threats and win the game. So very simple, methodical and the key thing to remember: when converting the advantage do not hesitate to go up a pawn or two for sort of the greater good okay, any questions why not bishop takes h3 and if you're indicating a move that I didn't play, try to be specific, try to be uh, try to be specific about where well fantastic fan. That's a too general of a question for whiter for black and I basically, if you want to look at my what I play in the speed run like I try to tailor the openings to what I would recommend to that level. Okay, let's go on, isn't that central night worth more than his undeveloped bishop, that you trade, that's a great question by second hanska um and yes in a strict sense. You're right! This knight is, is, is better place than the bishop. But if you think about what happens as a consequence of this trade, we get a square, that's again worth its weight in gold. So you do make a small positional concession, giving up a better piece in a strict sense, but in return you get something that that is is far a far greater value than the relative superiority of the night over the bishop um. Yes, so even if queen c1 won a pawn, I would still have probably gone there, because again we would get this massive potential outpost. Okay, every segment will be on youtube. Virtually every segment will be on youtube guys. It will also be in my twitch vods. So worry, not okay, so let's go for another sicilian, uh and I want to keep things moving along uh. So I'm sorry, if I didn't get to people's questions now, bishop c4, how do we usually meet this move uh as a review from our earlier games? We don't see this move that often anymore, it's it's more common at like a 1200, 1300 level yeah. So we want to go e6 at some point. Let's first develop our knight, but then we want to go e6 to blunt, the bishop and and we can go d5 we don't have to, though we can actually develop with knight f6. This is the best move actually and uh to some people. This might. Okay. Now we have a really cool idea, um. What is this really cool idea? I I've mentioned it in other contexts before, like it exists in other types of positions, but uh yeah man. We got some people on fire here, knight takes e4, bingo knight, takes c4 and then d5. What makes this good is that it it eliminates white's control over the center okay. He doesn't take so let's just go d5 anyway, but if he would have taken the knight we go d5, eliminating his control over the center and taking out his kind of important light squared bishop. So now we're up upon. We can simply um continue our development in a sort of conventional fashion. We can first unpin ourselves with bishop d7. Thank you glad to hear that major first uh should we take the night and don't say no just because I ask a question, I'm I I know that's like the high school thing to do uh and I'm used to that from like my own tests. Yes, we should, because we this bond structure, why not trades are good, let's just develop the other bishop again. Is this passive in a strict sense kind of, but we're up upon? We have a huge center and so again remember not every one of your pieces has to be conquering the you know, fringes of the roman empire at any moment. Okay, okay sephora is a very good move, uh, which pawn should we take, or should we even take a pawn yeah? So what we? What we want to try to do here, how should I put it is, is- is take the sting out of what's going on in the center. We want to be careful about opening up the e file before we've castled. Thank you a hardest hussein, so we actually want to play knight takes d4 and I'll explain after the game. Exactly why knight takes d4 uh is the best capture versus all the other captures I'll, explain it blow by blow, and he also disconnected man. We are dealing with some disconnectors today. One of the keys to understanding knight 64 is to understand that, if takes takes takes, we have what move at the end of the line and it's already been mentioned, but I want a couple of you to point out now. This move wow looks like he's overwhelmed by this. What is the move? Yeah, bishop, f6 right and, and you skewer the queen to the rook, winning the rook right and he yep another disconnect wow. These are some short games, so yeah, so basically e6 knight f6. Now what about e5 in this position? Uh e5 looks a little bit nasty, but we can immediately target the pawn with knight g4 and we can actually go d6 breaking up the spawn forcing it to to take, and we have a perfectly good position for black. Where should this bishop go? Where? Where should the c8 bishop be developed eventually, either now or in the future? Yeah b7? Of course we should fianchetto it. This is a great idea to fianchetto the bishop. You actually have horowitz bishops, that's what they're called because they're both sort of angling at the king, so you should take the clue from the other bishop like their pieces, should cooperate and that's the reason why e5 is not dangerous. D5 is also fine, but the problem is, he doesn't have to on passant here and your knight could get like stuck on h6, potentially okay, um and by the way white has to go rookie one, because this would blunder upon so ricky won. Tite takes c4, that's the key move. D5 here would be not as effective, because after e takes d5, we would not be able to capture with the pawn due to the pin. So if rook takes uh, we go d5 and we we pin and- and you guys are- are very much familiar with uh with this idea. What should white do here like to and remember that when you're losing a piece, especially if you've blundered or you're in the middle of some sort of tactical operation uh, you want to give that piece up for the maximum amount of material, so bishop d5, queen d5, knight c3 defending attacking, but I simply dropped. My queen back black's got the two bishops: black's got better central control than white and uh. Eventually, this bishop from c8 is going to be fianchettoed and remember: we've eliminated white's light squad bishop. So it's going to be completely uncontested, which is a really good thing when you're fianchetto to the long diagonal facing the can. Hopefully that makes sense. The position is still equal, but it's a pleasant kind of equal, so he goes d4. We go d5 now the key moment in the game. There's no science to understanding the pawn square. We just have to consider all of the captures and weigh their pros and cons dtx4. I didn't like for a very specific reason, and what I don't like about this is that if this e pawn disappears from e6 he's gonna have a direct line to my king. I don't really like that situation, so he can go d5, which is another pawn sacrifice, but you can you guys appreciate that this is a little bit nasty right, I mean he's, got the pressure sure I can castle, but now heaphy and keto is the bishop, and you know how this bishop kind of stares down my g7 pawn in short, white's pieces here, are very active and I don't like a situation where yeah, even at the cost of two pawns uh, there's such a disparity in piece activity, so that capture was ruled out now this one he plays c takes d5 and it's exactly the same thing. The e file has gotten opened. He can actually pile up on it with queen e2 and I'm having a hard time castling. So that was out of the question now what about not reacting at all? This would be my second choice. The issue with this is now he takes a bunch of times and he isolates the pawn on d5 right now. The pawn on d5 is super weak. If I play bishop c5, then queen takes d5 and he restores material equality. We actually get a similar scenario as in the the d-take c4 line, and so for that reason knight takes d4 is the best. What this actually does is it prevents c takes d5, because now this bishop is going to be hanging, which was not the case previously and if he tries to remedy the problem of the bishop by first, taking then c takes d5 allows queen takes d5 and once again, queen takes d4, allows bishop f6 skill wearing the queen to the rock, and instead he disconnected but uh already white, isn't in very big, very big trouble. Does that make sense? Hopefully I was at least semi. You know coherent and explaining the various captures and here's the concluding point I'll make before we move on to the next game, which is that there are certain positions where not every single chess move has verbal logic behind it. Sometimes you just have to freaking, get your hands dirty and look at the moves. Okay, there's! No like inherent reason. Why knight d4? Is the move uh? It's just that the other moves are bad and there's a reason that the other, why the others are bad uh, but you just have to calculate uh and and uh it's. You can't always talk your way into the correct move. You usually in fact the higher rated you get the less you talk to yourself during the game and the more you calculate so at my level, the logic behind moves is is commonplace to everybody, like all gms have a baseline level of knowledge and you're not going to beat anybody by out logicking them if that makes sense at the gm level. So that's why calculation becomes so incredibly crucial, although it's crucial at all levels, it's particularly indispensable at the grand master level, because a marginal superiority over someone else in terms of your visualization, your ability to calculate can result in. You know exponential uh improvements in in your games, because that's such a high stakes, uh area of the game. Okay, so let me put it this way at the gm level, everybody knows how to make layups so um you're, you're sort of practicing your three-pointer and at other levels- and I don't mean this in a condescending way. Uh, if you shoot layups or free, throws really really well. You can get a huge edge over somebody, but at a certain point everybody is a 90 free, throw shooter. So that's why other things become important.
