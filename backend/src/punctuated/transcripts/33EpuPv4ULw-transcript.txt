Well, we're getting there we're almost eleven hundred remember we were just a thousand, so okay, amazing, let's analyze, okay, so I want. I want people to understand this. This move folks is so deep that I think I'm gonna save this for one more three thousand, then I might talk about it and people might actually understand- and now let's skip this for now and let's just play another game. Those of you thinking all right when is daniel, gonna finally get to like you know, 1600s and 2000s, and it's an honor to have so many different people. But the thing that I want to point out before I I jump in is that I'm only doing one of these okay. This is this is gonna, be like an opus magnum. You know, I'm not gonna do seven speed runs, I'm not gonna. Do various kinds of speedruns I've sort of decided to do this. One speed run and I wanna do it really really? Well, I wanna do it the best that I possibly can and it's going to take a long time for me to get through the levels, and so I want to target every single level. I know that my audience is very diverse. There's beginners, there's advanced players and it is a slower one. I realize that it's a bit of a spoof, the name um, but just wanted to clarify that so everybody's on the same page and we've got sunni sumit, 2099. Okay, I hope that's not his rating, so we're still going to go e5, um and okay, queen f3. So this guy, I think, is loading up the scholars, mate bishop c4 drum roll, please there we go and you guys already know that when this kind of stuff happens, what you want to do is you want to develop your pieces and simultaneously prevent these threats? You don't want to go queen e7, you don't want to go queen f6, just go knight f6! You don't want to pre-move. Okay. When you see this kind of stuff, you don't want to pre-move okay, so he thinks he's cool right now and because we're at a slightly more advanced level. My response is, to these kind of kinds of things is going to be a little bit more advanced. Now, he's threatening bishop takes f7, so the knee-jerk response would be queen e7, but recognize that after bishop takes up some we've talked about this. The queen is the worst defender, because when it's attacked it has to respond to them. How can we attack the queen, such that after bishop f7 king e7, this queen is going to be overloaded? What move can we make and we've made this move many times before in these types of positions? It's it's a typical way to attack the queen in such positions. We, we aren't afraid to play knight t4. Now this is a move you have to play if you, if you're fully, you know confident in this type of position in your calculation uh, and it definitely comes as a surprise to him. So I will talk through this after the after the three games in more detail. Basically, bishop f7 king e7 queen has to stay on this diagonal, which is very hard to do, because this knight is guarding d5. Now those of you who are trying to practice your visualization, if bishop f7 king e7 and queen c4, how do we continue harassing the queen and forcing it off that diagonal? How do we force that queen off to that? Okay, we'll talk about that after the game? Beautiful everybody sees it now. This is a big chance for us because he hasn't developed any of his pieces. It's a golden opportunity for us to strike while the iron is hot. So how do we rip open the scene and, when I say strike while the iron sight, what I really mean is opening up the center, that is the gateway to so many different tactics. What does that mean? What move does that actually entail? Let's go and I'm I'm making this move really without any calculation, I'm just striking, because I'm absolutely sure that with a queen on like this on d3, this is not going to go over well for him. In fact, let's calculate e takes d5 knight takes d5. Is entirely possible, but we have a move that basically wins the game. What do we do? What do we do? My favorite question to ask you, but this is a very simple move and by this point we've dealt with so many of these openings. This should kind of be instinctual for most people and it is bishop f5, very good everybody's, seeing it he has to move his queen. We take on c2 and we win a rook and we're ahead of development and he's gotta move his king lots of bad stuff happening here for white. In fact, um tamak asks a a great question. I'm gonna note this down and I'm gonna answer this. While we're doing the autopsy after the game- oh whoa, okay, all right, I think he wants to give us a check on b5. I think he's attracted by this check. I can almost guarantee you he's going to give us this check, but maybe not I mean the fact that he's thinking tells me he's realized that something is amiss, I'm afraid that it is a little bit too late. Folks uh this move, d5 I've noted it down. I will explain it how how did I know when to open the center and when, when to develop? How do I know that tiamak asked that great question, I'm going to try to answer that and there's no generalized answer, but I'm going to try to provide some tips. Okay, let's take the pawn we're up a full queen. The rest is very simple one piece of advice: I've shared before that I'd like to repeat when you are up a full queen. You do not need to worry about defending every single pawn. So in this position I know a lot of you are thinking f6. I don't want to play f6. I don't want to weaken this diagonal. All right forget this pawn. Let him take it also. Don't play bishop d6, because that leaves the knight exposed. So can somebody give me a very zen move that just ignore the spawn and keep developing? What does that mean? Which move? Am I having my eye on yeah, bishop c5, very nice giraffe bishop e7 would have been good too. Queen d6 would have been a little bit too clunky right, you're using the queen to defend upon and, as I've said before, try be very careful about using a piece like the queen to perform a very small task like defending upon. So this is going to be so much easier. He's won a pawn, but we've completed our development he's probably going to castle because of our central. Oh all, right. Well, this is just asking for us. So what do we do? Yeah, trav man? I could have done that too uh, but I'll talk about that after the game. Rookie, eight, exactly bishop before, instead of bishops, if I'm just noting this down very good and uh it, you know, I know that you know people joke profit and stuff like I didn't know that by sacking on e5, we're gonna actually use that for our benefit. By opening the e file, I thought he would castle, but sometimes you know giving up upon his unforeseen benefits all right. We're going to take this now. This is another pretty instructive moment. I know we're up a queen and it's completely winning. What should we take with here? What should we take with you and remember those of you asking questions which are all great by the way I'll address every single one of them after the three games are played we're going to take with the knight? Why? Why don't we take with the rook with check? Because we already know the phrase? The threat is stronger in the execution. Here we are preparing a discovered check. A discover check is a lot stronger than taking with the rook and telling our opponent, okay, you're gonna have to move your king, because here he has moved his king, but he's moved it from the frying pan into the fire. The king is pinned well, sorry, the pawn is pinned, it cannot move, so it's not actually defending this bishop, so we can just take it, and you see that the discover check is one of the strongest tactical assets that you can have in any position. That doesn't mean it's always good, but in a position like this with a wide open king, you definitely want to set up a discovery, all right, two more games and then I'll talk about all three of them. Let's move on to the next one, very nice game and we're playing with alireza for russia. Okay, that's a pretty scary name, not gonna lie. If it was. If there was an ali in front of his name, I would have gotten a little bit more scared. Okay, so let us diversify a little bit and let's play some other openings. We have been playing the italian all right, well, never mind because he's not letting us do anything. So what do we do in this position? The king is the penny. Exactly we have to publish a book of the terminology. Can somebody remind me what move, what move do we play against the philidor we play d4? Why do we play d4 because by playing d60 a has not developed a piece b he's obstructed as bishop both of these things are serious concessions, which means that to exploit them, we open up the center another typical situation do not rush to move this knight we can just develop because once he takes this knight, this queen is perfectly safe because he no longer has a knight on b8 to attack our queen with c5 is a very typical move for a lot of players in this position, but do not assume that attacking the queen is just going to be a naturally good thing. We'll talk about that after the game. But the move c5 is a very classic mistake in these types of positions. How do we continue our development? What would be the most active way of now proceeding and just you know very natural move, but I just want to kind of help. Everybody practice your your sort of sense for where the pieces belong, so to speak. Exactly bishop c4, the f7 pawn he's probably going to bring his night out and we're just going to continue our development. We don't need to move our queen anywhere. Queen is perfectly safe. In fact, we are trying to provoke the move c5 and the main issue with that move. Since he's thinking I can talk about, this is going to be that he weakens the d5 square, and that is a central square that you certainly do not want to weaken permanently. Okay, let's castle he's probably going to go knight, c6 big deal he's attacking our queen. Oh we move the queen. Where should we move the queen? And here we've got to be very careful. I know that a lot of people- I know it we're going to see somebody say queen d5 and that's tempting but be very careful about moving your queen into too much traffic queen d5 might allow bishop e6 queen d3 might allow knight e5- and I don't want to part ways with this bishop, so I'm going to do something here that some people really you're so lame day and queen d1 come on man. Guindy won and sometimes you have to retreat. That doesn't mean we've done anything wrong. In fact, our position is so incredibly active and uh. We can continue to activate our pieces, but it's okay to make the occasional retreating move. That doesn't mean anything. So how do we continue activating our pieces? We have a beautiful outpost for one of our pieces. What piece am I talking about? We can develop this bishop, that's fine, but I'm thinking about a particular outpost. Let's get this knight over to the center. Let's get this knight over to the center look at this beautiful square. We can take the bishop at our leisure, but we're not going to because this knight is very strong, we're going to try to make him be the one to take this knight, and I really like the proposal of hidden king: let's increase our central control by playing f4. That's not necessarily the move that I would make in a game that I would play, but I want to show people how to attack like this. Okay, so we haven't completed our development, which is not a situation that I like particularly and here is a good example of when to maneuver. Now we look at this bishop for a second okay, we can put it on e3. Is it really doing anything on e3? We could be getting more bang for our buck. Where should the bishop go, and this will look like a very awkward move initially, but it's it's a maneuver right. We make an awkward move, but then the bishop maneuvers to a good square boom. Zeraf, that's the right idea. I don't want to play b3, because that weakens the long diagonal, but the idea is the same. We're getting our bishop look at this we're reading his mind because we're not thinking about the immediate square, we're thinking about the long-term square. Now we get the bishop to the long diagonal and we have an extra knight- and this is not a coincidence. I've told I've said this before when we play like this. We piss our opponent off, I mean we annoy him. Okay, what should we do he's attacking our our knight? We already know that there are two main methods of trying to convert extra material, believe it or not. We can actually make a move that doesn't involve moving the knight. This is one of those things that you just got to kind of think about, because we have so many active pieces. Gotta start thinking about how to how to set threats. Bingo the wrath is on fire, queen d4 attacking the pawn. If he plays bishop f6, then we get a chance to trade. Everything in one fell swoop. Okay, it allows us to deliver checkmate um. How do I find a move like 15, queen d4? How do you know to look for it I'll talk about that after the game? Let me just open up the window and we see different openings. We see the french now the opening that I really like to play against the french. To illustrate conceptual, I wanted to say conceptual concepts. That's how I know it's 10 p.m. Is the advance french and the advanced french causes trouble to a lot of french players because it leads to a close position now. This is a conceptual mistake. We talked about this. He is attacking the tip of the pawn chain rather than the base of the pawn chain. That is wrong in this case and in most cases, because what happens when you attack the tip of the pawn chain very often is that look at this square on e5. Now it is a square that we can occupy with a knight. Now it is an outpost that he has granted us and in addition, we still have nice central control. Now, one very important thing: we don't need to get our knight to e5 immediately, it's just a square, that's available to us at some future point for now we're just going to develop our pieces right. There's no need to to rush with anything. We can just complete our development at our leisure and he always is going to have to watch for this now he's playing with some serious fire. In addition to allowing us this square 85, he has opened up the e-file, which means that there's a very natural move that we can play now. Thank you. Jay kushner, for the sub knight g5 is a knight. G5 is a very good move, but let's play in a more almost stereotypical fashion, not very creative, but very strong. I mean it's hard to defend the spare there. We go guess what move now this allows now this knight has landed on f8 to defend the pawn. So what move now should be considered and there's a couple of interesting things eric the red, unfortunately not 70s at the moment, but I'll talk about that knight, g5, okay, but knight g5 doesn't attack the pawn let's play in a very methodical fashion. I want to go knight, e5, okay, I'm gonna go 95.. The problem with 95 is, you might take it, so I want to get this bishop out of d6. I want to trade it. So what we're going to do- and this is a move- I'm going to make and explain later- is go bishop g5, there's two principle reasons for this. First of all, I'm developing my bishop to a very active square. Good. Second of all- and this is a typical french idea- I'm not pulling this out of my behind bishop h4 bishop g3 is going to invite the trade of bishops once the bishops are traded. Our knight is going to have free passage to the e5 square. This is another maneuver, okay and he's done it our work for us. This kind of play once again yields positive benefits, even without us trying to complete our idea. Okay, knight g6. How do we continue? How do we continue and there's many good moves here in literature? There's a phrase kill your darlings, which means sometimes you have to get rid of what you love, so I would very seriously consider taking with the knight and then the bishop, to force his king out, but because I love this knight too much, I don't want to kill our darlings. Let's go bishop takes g6 and instead of grabbing this pawn with a knight greedily. Let's try to take this pond with something else. What else can we take this pawn with, or at least try to take this bond with, and that in combination with the night is going to yield tremendous tremendous attacking benefits? Let's go here. I've told you guys this at the very beginning of our speedrun, the knight and the queen is the strongest pair of attackers on the chessboard. There is no pair of two pieces, not even a queen and a rook in some regards that are as strong of attackers as the queen and the knight because of their ability to control squares because of their ability to defend each other because of their ability to deliver checkmate, all right and that's nice. How that word coincided with him playing king f8. Okay, we've got a lot to unpack, we're not going to take too long on this. I want to do at least one more set of games, but let's jump in to the analysis. Okay, you know things are going well here, all right. First game: sumi 2099! I know people are excited to look at this game, but we'll get there now the move, knight d4, let's unpack this for a second bishop f7 king e7, one thing to watch out for sometimes people forget that the e6 square is undefended when the e6 square is undefended. I know this looks ridiculous right now, but this could be checkmate. Okay, so make sure that the e6 square is actually defended. When you allow bishop takes f7, he has to play queen c4 to keep his queen protecting and the move. B5 is a fitting representation of what's going on here, because the queen, the poor queen, has to leave the bishop. It has no more squares. Diagonal all are protected. King f7 we're up a piece. Now I am chess man asked about knight a5, which would be also relatively effective. Now the problem this knight is undefended. I've emphasized the importance of undefended pieces many times. You've got to be very careful about that. What can white do here to save material? You can give a check and trade the bishop for the night, so in addition to the night being centralized, it is also defended by a pawn which greatly raises its appeal. The way I would think about this is in relation to the queen right. The queen is the easiest piece to attack. So when our opponent is developed as queen early, we can often get away with opening up the center before we have completed our development, because our opponent has now completed his and we already have developed two pieces right and he's only developed one and the queen is like an anti-developed piece. That's actually a negative net negative. So when our opponent has his queen positioned so awkwardly on a square like d3, that's what really sets off the alarm bells right. It's that awkward positioning of the queen. Okay, what happens if we open up the center, you calculate a little bit and you see the bishop. F5 wins. I know that's not a good answer, but at least hopefully you know that can provide some context and then the only other important moments right, ignoring the pawn we're up a queen. We don't need to do that. We can just develop our bishop. The check on before would be fine, but it would allow him to block it with a pawn. So this would not be anything spectacular. We could come back to c5 here. That would be fine, but after knight takes e5, it might allow him to support the knight with d4. Okay, the rest was very simple: knight takes e3 preparing the discovery and winning another piece, and he resigned okay next game, he played a philidor, so we played d4 one tidbit that I shared earlier. Those of you um, who are here uh, who have not been here when I talked about this for the first time, but a little trivia question for those of you who have what is the interesting tidbit about the philidor, and this is unconfirmed, but I'm about 95 sure that this is the case. What is the interesting tidbit I shared about the philidor the last time. One of our opponents played it. Yes, philidor and j news is correct: philidor never played it himself, andre philidor, 18th century chess pioneer never actually played the philidor. I think he just talked about it in his seminal chess work, but that's just an interesting little factoid about the way that chess openings are sometimes named and uh philadelphia is not a terrible opening. Okay and- and I want to take a second to talk about something that people don't always realize, there's a bunch of these openings and one opening is called the 5000 bit opening that gem, jim, just just played holy smokes incredible incredible support, 70 gifted subs over the course of the week and now unbelievable stuff. Thank you so much for another tremendous bit drop the absolute legend, the vampire the penny appreciate it uh and um. The philidor yeah gem jim before jam jam rudely distracted me from talking about the philadelphia with this 5000 bits, but I appreciate it. Yeah there's a misconception that openings like the philadelphia openings like even d5, are, are, in some sense absolutely terrible and lose, or even the move queen e7, which my first coach used to play against me and drive me crazy, because it's this is actually a very hard move to refute. These openings are not losing they're, not terrible, they're, just dubious and the most that white can do if black plays well is get a solid edge, but nothing more than that. So you have to temper your expectations if your opponent plays something like this, do not go crazy, trying to win the game in five moves. It's a lot better to adhere to basic principles and get a small advantage than to go wild and try to win the game quickly. That's exactly what people who play these types of openings once: okay, so d4 opening up the center developing our pieces developing pieces dropping our queen back to d1. So just to recap, if we go queen d5 um, our queen, you know enters the highway and we don't want that right. It gets into too much trouble if we go queen d3, we allow 95 and he roots out our bishop um, so we dropped the queen back, which is totally fine. Knight, t5 and zerath asks in some positions. I try to put a knight on an outpost, but my opponent almost always has something like 97 to challenge the knight and I lose the outpost, any suggestions on how to get the outpost anyways. Well, that's a good question right and the fact of the matter is knight. T5 is not truly an outpost, because we can envision a scenario where he drops his knight away from c6 from c6 and then plays c6 to kick the knight away. The way that you want to think about outposts is in terms of trade-offs right. You want to envision all the scenarios where he gets rid of the outpost. One of them is the scenario in which he captures the knight on t5, but the fact of the matter is: what do we gain in return for the night outpost? Well, we get the bishop now on an outpost which is a pretty darn good outpost, maybe not as good as the night. Wouldn't you say this is pretty good. We have the possibility of winning his pawn structure. We have the possibility of the bishops cooperating. So when you think of chess advantages, you want to think of them in a transformational sense, you don't want to think of anything as a permanent advantage. You want to think of something. Okay, this is an outpost. What happens if my opponent tries to trade that outpost? Can I replace that advantage with something else and that something else can be as as ethereal as time if it takes your opponent, four moves to do something that in and of itself is already a reason to do that thing. In the first place, I don't know if I'm making sense, but time is a huge commodity. It's like the money of chess, okay, um and, and something takes your opponent three or four moves to do. You can use those three or four moves to lift a rook up and then transmute that into um into uh into an attack, and I have a really good example of that that I just showed one of my students earlier today. I'm sorry to take so many details. Let's finish this game and then I'll show it very quickly. Here we transfer our bishop to the long diagonal where it can sort of cooperate with the other bishop and, of course he blunders his knight. He sort of he was intent on playing this move, and so we unwittingly also prevented it then drop our bishop back and then we create the threat of queen. Take g7. This, as you guys know, is called a battery when we stack a bishop and even on top of each other. It's one of the exceptions to what I was talking about about not putting the queen in too much traffic here. This is more effective than putting the bishop first and the queen second uh, because we're actually threatening checkmate. Okay. I there were some questions that I missed. Let me just look over the chat for a second um. Will there ever be a female chess player like beth harmon? Well, I would say that there already was uh and her name was judith pogar and um people don't always realize this, but polgar there's two things to say here now I finished queen's gambit two days ago, so I have some more thoughts. Polgar, I think at the highest yeah was world number eight. She was, I think, a grandmaster and grandmaster, not women's gm, but actual grand master at 13, and she was you know one of the most feared players on the international chess circuit. Her style was incredibly tactical. She was blowing people off the board. She was blowing 2700s off the board regularly and um, and just to round off the beth harmon conversation pogar uh, my my long time coach left sahis, who now lives in israel grand master. Obviously, russian grand master was also one of the strongest players in the world in the 80s and 90s, and knows polgar very well and- and he told me that people and people hated playing judith pogar because of her style. She she was 24, incredible, opening, preparation, um and and just blowing people off the board. Um and, as I understand it, beth harmon's main main move was when he four, although against vorgov well, some stuff was changed up uh, but in any way. Well. Thank you, tyler, okay, um. In any case, this is how this game ended. Let me make a very quick detour to show one thing before our last game before our second speed run segment um, I don't know what the orthodox gambit is just give me a second guys. I need to find this game there's just one moment from a game that illustrates the concept of buying yourself time, literally, okay and um. This is a pretty high level example, so you know I'm not going to spend too long on it, but it's important trust me we're good um, so we can go back to this scene and, as you guys can see, this is a game between spassky and the fm fm geller. Yes, jen uh geller, yes or sarah one's favorite player uh was playing black here. Yes, exactly yes, precisely uh, okay, so it is white to play. This was a close sicilian. This was not silberg, it was uh quarter-final of the candidates uh, so this was spassky's world championship run, anyways he's playing white here, it's white to play and let's very quickly, understand, what's going on now. This is one of those situations where, in the closed situation, often white attacks on the king side and he tries to get his queen to h4 those of you who play the grand prix attack. This is kind of a sister opening uh to the grand prix. I guess this is a classical game. Now. The problem is that black also has something to say about that he's attacking on on the queen side right he has the a file he's got this fiance bishop and if white just willy-nilly, plays g4, here's going to be the problem black's going to take on a1, now he's just going to snap that pawn off on g4 exposing the attack on the queen and getting rid of this incredibly valuable knight. So here's what spassky does- and I won't give this to anybody as a problem just be it trust me I'll, give you guys a chance to exercise this. I just want to show this. For now he goes rook c1, which is a move that wouldn't occur to most people because he's voluntarily giving up that af. Why is he giving up an entire file that he seems to be fighting for? Not only is he giving up the file geller? Thank you very much. Boris vasilyevich I'm going to get my rook to a2 and then I'm going to get my queen to a6 and he gets both of his pieces on the a file. Here's the reason he plays this move. The only purpose of this move is to buy himself time. Okay, he's setting up this art this fort on c2. Consider this like an army fort this army, ford is staffed with soldiers, and he knows that there are not enough soldiers to last forever. He knows that, eventually, black is going to get to the c2 pawn once he takes that pawn. The dam breaks the water floods in, but he's buying himself enough time to get such an attack going on the king's side. That, by the time geller takes that c2 pawn and he tries trust me I'll show you spassky is going to be well on the way to checkmating him. Look at what happens queen a6 spassky, very methodically, but very quickly, geller! Guess! Where he's going? He's going a3 he's going after the pawn, but by the time he gets there and he has finally gotten there. That is when spassky goes quinn, h4 and if he finally takes the pawn here, perhaps you guys can tell me how white wins the game? Okay, maybe I'm taking a long time to talk about something very obvious, but I think this is a very deep concept. Brooke takes f6 and mate is inevitable. Geller must move the rook away. Spassky. Does this anyway? There's a lot of tactics here? He sacks another knight. This is completely winning for black, because um the pieces just pour in and the attack is completely unstoppable. Queen takes g6 is coming. I know that I'm going fast through the details. Just trust me on this white is completely crushing. So that is the purpose of why I'm showing you this, because you have to be very flexible in chess. You have to understand that time is in and of itself a very valuable commodity, completely waiting for white. Yes, thank you for the correction nicola, okay, back to the speed run and back to the last game, because I know everybody's anxious for me to play more okay um. So that's actually one of my favorite games now in this game he played a french just to uh recap: f6 is I I mean. I think this is a mistake uh, because whoops, because c5 here is the main move attacking the base of the bond chain. We've already faced this once e takes f6 now we've got a weak square on e5, but we don't occupy it immediately. We don't rush, we don't rush because he can take our knight and um aaron nimsovich, who I've referenced several times. He calls the situation like a visit to the dentist right, you're, letting black visit. The dentist and fill his cavity like the pawn on e5 is, is a filling you don't want to. Let your opponent feel fill his cavities right. You want to put a piece on a weak square, not necessarily a pawn a bit of a not an example. I think anybody needed especially people like eating ice cream right now. Thank you. Scruffy roden, but you get the point. I think it's actually a pretty effective example: okay, um rookie! Well this I I didn't think of this analogy that was nemesis. Okay. I really I recused myself from this. Thank you nephew for uh gifting, two tier one subs to the community, tyler mandel and sultan okay, so rookie one attacking upon everything we did here was very obvious up until this moment. This is the e5 square that we want to occupy. This is the bishop that is defending it. We ask ourselves the next logical question codex, thank you so much and since- and I can't even keep up with these subs two months from send fish codex with eight months. Thank you so much this square and e5 is defend. We want to get rid of the bishop. How do we get rid of the bishop? Well, we have a bishop of our own. Can we put it on f4? No, we cannot. Can we prepare the mood bishop f4 we can, but the problem with something like this is going to be this ruins our pawn structure near our king. I don't want that. So what we do and nephew himself something we get our bishop from g5 all the way back to g3, okay- and I can show you a million examples where, where something like this happens, I can pull out examples from some of my own games. I think um, I'm not sure. If I can remember, I think I can remember one from the top of my head, but I mean this is this is very typical again, I'm not trying to to sell to play myself off as oh. I have all these games to show you. This is truly very typical, and here we go well, not exactly the same thing um, but but you get the points um and- and let me just go back to the chest-based scene. This is a game. Ah, chess space is not made for streaming, so I have to keep changing stuff uh, but but it's worth it thank you for being so patient all right, okay, we're good! This is my game against varukovian from the 2011 u.s championship. It was a french. It was a different line of the french, but the same thing happened. The e5 square is weakened and um bishop g5, bishop h4 and bishop g3 so and the point of this I've already taken his bishop, but I'm still transferring my bishop to reinforce my control over that e5 square. So this is stuff again that actually happens. You know in real life, um back to the speedrun quote: unquote speedrun! Here we do the same thing. We get our bishop there. Instead he loses his patience. He allows our knight to get t5 and then he goes knight, g6 and here of course, as I explained during the game, we're trying to take on g6 t9k, as I explained we're trying to treat his bishop in order to free up the c5 square um, so we're trying to take the spawn on g6 and uh deliver checkmate on f7, which he misses. He has ways of defending with rook h6 and to the point of flexibility we don't stubbornly get our bishop back to g3. How do we change our plans dynamically in the context of attacking this pawn? Bishop g5 is correct, he's completely busted because he can't move his rook he's just lost. Here I mean he's going to lose a lot of pieces, what happens if they move their bishop back after we move our bishop back well that, then, then we succeed right. If he doesn't do this and if he goes whatever empty move and if he goes bishop b7 we've succeeded right. We can now get our knight to e5 scot-free. I'm not actually saying that this is the best idea, but I want people to understand that. I'm not doing everything, because it's the best I'm trying to illustrate crea, instructive ideas, so people can file file them away and apply them. That doesn't mean. I personally would always do this kind of stuff, seth, morgan io! Thank you for the tier one. Why not knight c3 and then ip5 well, knight c3, would be pretty easy to prevent. That's really the only reason, but this would be very, very uh, very good plan as well. This idea is just harder to prevent, because this pathway is is just impossible to stop.
