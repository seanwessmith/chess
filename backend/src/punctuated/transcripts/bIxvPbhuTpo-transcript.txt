[Music] here we go 1931 and again we are playing with the white pieces and again I'm gonna play one e4: okay, yeah I'll go over that herb master I'll, be sure to go over that after the game, so he plays d5. This is called the scandinavian opening and I have a very fun fact about the scandinavian I'll share uh after the game. Now the reason that I don't recommend this candy to most players is because you bring the queen out early very early before the other pieces. If you've seen searching for bobby fischer, you you'll know that that's another great chess movie in the movie, the main character he has a problem with bringing the queen out early. The problem with bringing the queen out early is that I'm able to develop my pieces and attack the queen at the same time, which gives me a lead in development. In addition, I'm going to control the center now by playing d4 continue my development. Normally, you want to develop your knights before your bishops, and this is what and maybe somebody with a little bit less experience remind me what this is called and how do we defend against this? What can we do about this? This is called a pin. I can't move my knight, I would drop my queen and the way that we can defend against the pin. There's two main ways: we can try to get this bishop out of the picture or we can intercept the pin with one of our lesser value pieces, in which case we can now move our knight and that would simply lead to a bishop trade. That's fine! We don't need to move our knight. We just can. If we wanted to so now, we're going to continue developing now we're going to continue developing and now, let's centralize our knight and when I say centralized, I mean literally put a piece on one of the central squares where the piece is the most active. Now we haven't completed our development. There is a bishop. The bishop has not been developed. Where should we put this bishop? Let's give him a taste of his own medicine. Let's give him a taste of his own medicine yeah. We got a huge raid from charlie f5 uh, so I think you guys mean g5 yep bishop to g5. What is this? This is a pin, but look at his position he's passive here. He's really cramped on these last couple. Rows. Look at my pieces. They had a bishop, knight, they're, all well placed and guess what, when all of your pieces are well placed like this, you immediately need this and charlie would be the first to say this. You got to think about attacking now in order to attack, we need to open up some files and avenues toward his king uh, and one idea that comes to mind. Look at this rook very carefully. Do you remember guys in the last game I had a plan. Let me very quickly show you oh it doesn't. Let me look at the last game, so I had a plan where I basically opened up that f file. Sorry one sec, oh there, it is, I basically needed to open up that f file by playing knight, d2, f4 and f5. Can you see the parallel here? What can white do here? It's the same exact plan. We can go f4 f5 open up the file for the rook, and this rook is also going to put a lot of pressure on the knight. So that's where pattern recognition happens. That's why I always emphasize to people if you want the fastest way of improving. Look at your own games, figure out your mistakes figure out what you should have done and you can use the computer for that and and try to build off of that try to kind of collect in your mind or even in a real notebook, uh, the various ideas and the plans that you think are cool that you could apply in a future game. That's what makes chess so magical, there's always an x game and there's always an opportunity to correct your mistakes. So, let's see what he does now. C5 would be no problem. We would just take on c5 and arcane can be tucked away into the corner here, where it's very safe and uh he's in some trouble he's in some trouble because we're about to play f5, we can also bring this rook into d1 in order to support the pawn on d4. Why would we do this because he might move his bishop back and if he moves his bishop back, then his queen is going to attack our pawn uh. It would be a good idea to defend it. Okay, it's not that I don't care about the clock um, but I think the explanation is more important. Now. Can we play them with f5? Is that a good idea, or do we want to prepare it? What do you guys think there's actually something better that we can do well, there's there's quite a coup, there's quite a few good things we could do. I think that we should go f5. Let's see what happens in a tournament game. I actually myself would not play f5 and I'll explain why after the game, but he takes now what well we can recapture. We could also capture his knight, but there's no need to do that. Let's accumulate the pressure. Rook takes five. Now the file has been opened. Okay, now things get really interesting. Okay, so, let's unpack this situation, we have a knight here. How many times has the knight defended one? Two three, the knight is also being attacked three times. We don't need to worry about it because uh, the knight is defended the same number of times that it's being attacked. So one thing that we would consider doing here is bringing all of the pieces into the game. We can do that in several different ways, so one of them is to go rook 8 to f1. This is called doubling the rooks, where the two rooks are stacked on the same file, and this increases the pressure on the f-file. Now he's got a very, very strong move here. He doesn't find it he plays takes, and now this is a fork. It is true. We are also pinned it's the same thing. We saw in the last game, we're forked, but we fork him, but we're also pinned but still look at his knight. That night is under so much pressure. Look at all of our pieces staring it down as soon as this knight is captured, that king is going to be in huge show because he's going to recapture with a pawn he's going to have to okay and he finds a cool idea, but it doesn't well. Does it work, though these people are good, ladies and gentlemen, so he seems to blunder a bishop. Let's see what his idea is, and he gives me a fork. He forks my king in the rook. Are we screwed? Are we screwed? We are not. We can drop the ruck back. We can drop the rook back simultaneously defend against the check and the fork and now we're simply up a piece he plays knight d5. We capture it and uh. Now all we need to do and we have a very cool idea. I'm going to un-pin myself, I'm going to unpin myself. He takes my reign, he resigns now. There was something very cool here if he would have taken my rook and I'll explain everything. What would I have done in this position? I would not have recaptured his rook, which would be fine. There is actually a very cool checkmate. Thank you thank you, kwams, and, and we had a sub that I missed. I apologize for that. Thank you. Um rod, yakassa for the sub queen takes f7, is backrank, made exactly take stakes and good by kingovich, exactly okay. So let's walk through that and, as you can see, the opponents are getting better. These games are are becoming more competitive, which is what's making this fun. Now he played the scandi okay, knight, f3 bishop b2, again unpinning ourselves, so that the knight can now move. We did move the knight. Did I blunder the pawn here? Why didn't I? Why didn't my opponent take on d4? What was my idea, who can tell me yeah and I'll? Show you guys everything in a moment? Well, what this move accomplishes is that it opens up the opens up the d file as we've already seen. You want to be careful about giving rooks open files, because open files can lead to checkmate very, very quickly. Thank you. Five nor latch for the tier one his queen has to move back just visually. Look at how active my pieces are. His pieces are basically on their initial squares. Black is in very big trouble um. Well, I have a story about the scandi. I've told this story before funny story and then we'll move on for the game uh to the game. Uh the year is about 1895 and two strong british players are facing each other. So in the 1800s there used to be a very old rule in tournament, chess that if you touched a piece that had no legal squares, you had to move your king, okay, that was just a rule uh in order to discourage people from you know, just touching all the pieces right nowadays, it's you, don't you're not punished for that, but it is touch move. If you touch a piece, an official tournament chess, you have to move it. So this guy touches the bishop on c1 and maybe he you know, looked at the position wrong or hallucinated. Now the bishop has no legal squares right, it's blocked in by its pawns, so he had to move his king and he chose the most disastrous time to do it. What does black have in this position? This is one of the shortest games in chess history, because, amazingly black has the move queen e4 checkmate. This is not a mate that everybody's familiar with it's a three-move checkmate, not the fastest, that's possible, but look at white's king and the queen they're in a standoff king has no squares. The queen controls all of them a little rhomboid shape here anyways. I think that guy did not have a very good day after that, but let's go back to the game. So essentially he didn't take our pawn. We pinned his knight. Why didn't we play the move, knight e4, applying pressure on his knight on f6? The reason is very much. The same. Remember again: connect the patterns, bishop b2 unpinning, us from this pin and symmetrically. He can do exactly the same thing you can play. Bishop e7, his queen is no longer pinned and the knight on f6 is now very, very well defended. So I can trade a bunch of pieces here, but that's not good. For me, training pieces lessens the intensity of the attack when you're attacking you need pieces to deliver checkmate with, and that's why I played f4. Okay, so f4 f5 takes takes rook to f1, and then he finds this very cool idea. Bishop takes c5 and queen d4. So this is a fork because he's attacking the king and the rook. If I move the king, he takes the rook. I can't take back because his queen is defending the rook. A rookie three is the defensive move. Now he had a better try here than what he did. He could have. What was this better try? What was this better? Try? Oh? Why? Wouldn't I play f5 in tournament chess, so the reason I wouldn't play f5 is because I was a little bit scared of his response queen to b6 attacking the pawn on d4. If I was playing a grandmaster, I would have played a slower move, such as rook to d1 so knight to g4. You guys are absolutely correct. Um knight g4 was a better try. It's the same exact thing as after knight d5, except I don't control that square. So he wants to take my rook. Can somebody spot white's response? I had seen this and I calculated one step ahead. Queen e3, he still takes the rook with the queen. It's not knight d1, although you're very close, it's not queen f3 either. If we try queen f3, I understand what you guys want to do, but remember in comparison to that thing. We talked about he's, got two rooks on e8, so queen f8 is not back right. Mate smash factors, amazing, some of you are getting it. The move is rook to d1. How do I come up with this move? What does it do? Two things that it does? We attack the queen right. We attack the queen, so if he takes our rook with either piece, then we take his queen and if you calculate the variation, then at the end of the day, white is up a whole piece. I am up a bishop, that's huge, that's winning if he takes with the knight. Now I'm up a queen. Now you might be looking at this and saying: okay, but no problem, I mean can't he just move his queen back to b6 and once again we're faced with the same idea of him taking on e3. But this is what you have to do. You always have to try to detect how the position changes as a consequence of the last couple moves. If you look very carefully at this position, you can't play rookie 8 because of the pin. That's what a pin is that is illegal, because the king will be under fire right. This is what a pin is you. You cannot expose your king by it by law. So if you look at how the position has changed, it changed change it. You can now take the knife, the knight is no longer defended. He takes the rook, we take the rook, he takes the bishop, we move the king away, the smoke is cleared and white is now up a night. Okay. What about rook to f4 great question rook to f4 has the same idea, but it's the wrong execution. Jimmy garoppolo would find this move instantly because there's an interception that happens. We ins, we accidentally intercept uh, I'm a big 49ers fan, yes, and I'm kind of sour about how things are going. The rook on e3 is no longer protected and uh. I am from the bay area by the way anyways uh. So that's basically the idea now queen f2 to unpin ourselves and attack f7, which caused them to resign which caused them to resign. Okay, doosan, five, five, five and we're playing with the black pieces. Let's play the situation: lucas aiden, the sicilian is when you play c5 and the opening that I have been playing almost exclusively well, never mind because he does not play the main line which is d4. He plays c3. This is called the aleppo and sicilian uh named after a lithuanian chess player. His idea is to prepare to control the center with the move d4. Okay. Now what we need to do here as black is: we need to immediately contest the center with our pieces, so we're going to get the night out in order to attack his pawn so that he doesn't have a chance to play before he goes bishop to d3 take bologna. Thank you. That's not a great move, because now we can occupy the center and his bishop has blocked the other bishop from coming out, which is something you want to really a situation you want to try to avoid he's, got e5 attacking our knight. Can somebody tell me where should we put this knight? Where should we go in order to attack this pawn? White is not worse here. This is a line but yeah knight g4. Let's get to this pawn. Let's try to win it. Now his correct move yep. He plays it correctly very nice. It goes bishop b5 uh to attack my knight, the usual, let's un-pin that knight, so the knight can once again move there's a lot of trap. This is a line I used to study. Ah, but, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very sexy move here. Look at this bishop we've encountered this tactic many times before, and those of you just joining I'll show you guys after the game the precedent we can play knight takes e5. I think, if I'm calculating this right, I might be dropping a piece here now. What what am I doing? Well, what I'm doing is that this bishop look at it very carefully, it's hanging, which means if he takes the knight we take his bishop, but if he takes the bishop with check thinking. Ah then I'm gonna take the night nope, because this very same night is it's double parked. It's gonna take the take, take the bishop and, at the end of the day, we're gonna be up a pawn we're up a pawn, but we still need to complete our development and we're not just up any pun, we're up a center pawn. It worked. It worked like a charm, now he's doing exactly what I did in the previous game, which is he's trying to open up the file. It's a pretty nasty idea. Can we stop him from going f5, not physically, but can we take the sting out of that move? Can we try to prevent it? How who can tell me- and this is a very instructive moment, so we go g6 and after the game, I will explain why we don't literally stop him. Why not f5 there's a reason for that? Be patient I'll, explain that after the game, I've put I've noted it down now. Why does g6 stop f5 because it adds another defender. Remember pawns capture diagonally, it adds another defender to f5. So if he goes f, I will just take it. What is the other thing that this move accomplishes and uh? First, what we're going to do here is: let's lock up the position a little bit so that we can focus on completing our development. The other thing that it does is that it it creates a little hole for the bishop. This is called fianchettoing, the bishop, it's an italian term, which means to put the bishop on the longest diagonal on the chessboard either this one or this one generally fianchettos happen on g2, b2, b7 or g7, and now we are going to complete our development by castling. Now we need to come up with a plan. We need to come up with a plan and um. We need to come up with a well first of all, let's take a look at this night. We can trade possible, but this night, let me tell you, has perhaps the sexiest outpost of all time. Where can this knight travel to? Who can spot a very nice square on the board in the center of the board, where this knight could land? Let's go? Absolutely this is called an outpost. An outpost is a square in your opponent's territory, where a piece cannot be bothered by any pawns. If you look at the pawns they've advanced past this square, so they can never never chase away. The knight this is called an eternal knight in russian. Now is this knight on e5? Is that knight eternal? Is that night? Eternal is this on an outpost? Can we show him that this night is no get out of here? It ain't, eternal, nope out and guess what once he moves his knight out if he goes back to e5 we're gonna, take it with our bishop. Now. Why would we give up our bishop because look at our bishop very carefully, the bishop isn't really doing anything anyway. It's just biting on granite, as I like to say every single stream 50 times, so we might as well give it up for his knight and rid ourselves entirely of that of that uh nuisance. Now, look at this knight versus this bishop. This is a classic case of good knight, vs bad bishop. Our knight is on an outpost. His bishop is incredibly cramped, but we need a plan. We can't win this game without a plan. What could our plan look like? How could we transform this positional advantage into something specific? What can we so there's two main plants here we could play on the queen side or we could bring pieces into the king side and try to attack his king, because I don't have much time. Let's do the second thing and also because I'm going to, but we can also combine. Let's combine the plans. Let's now go b5 to just lend some reinforcements to b5. Remember you can combine plans and chess. You can do two things at the same time, particularly if you have very active pieces uh, you can multitask that's okay, play on both sides, so we're gonna try to prepare the b4 pawn breakthrough, but at the same time we're gonna keep an eye on possibilities for attacking his king, okay and I'm gonna play a little bit faster here now. If he he knows what he's doing he's going to play a3 to prevent me from from potentially preparing b4, and then I'm gonna have to redirect my attention to to this side of the board. Okay. So, let's first test him a little bit: let's prepare b4, hopefully well, no, he doesn't go a3, so we might as well strike with b4 okay. Why am I doing this? What am I accomplishing? What I'm accomplishing ultimately, is I'm trying to open up the b file? Why is it important to open up the file, because if we open up the file this rook on b2, you see that you see that it can infiltrate to b2. The second rank is prime real estate. This is you know central park, new york, real estate for the rook and he's doing our bidding for us he's allowing me to open up the file for the other rook. So he there's gonna be hell today. We're gonna trade queens here and you guys might wait a second. Why are we trading queens? Well, because we've got more than enough pieces to checkmate him with, even without the queen's watch? Okay. What do we do now? Somebody remind me: I've got a thing for the sub. True three false three! Thank you for the two months. Let's go, let's go, let's go: let's go rook, b2 infiltration! Now we're going to put the other rook on f1, it's going to be not checkmate immediately. We shouldn't rush, but he's either going to get trackmated or he's going to lose a bunch of his pieces. So we're going to give him a check forcing his rope to drop out. We can't take the classic sort of russian very old-school, big zarook, look at the domination of the knight over the bishop. Neither of these pieces have moved a muscle since move 17.. So that's been the narrative of the game. That's been like the unspoken sort of backdrop in which everything is proceeded without a bishop, and this bishop is essentially a big pun. He just can't play he. He doesn't have the sufficient horse horsepower literally and figuratively, to sort of prevent me from just ravaging his position. I'm going to push the pawn out to a3 this pawn isn't going anywhere. He gives me a meaningless check. This king could evacuate to h6 nice little square, and here we need another plan. I'm going to play this slowly, I'm going to advance my pawns on the king side no need to rush here, because white is completely paralyzed. 150 paralyzed- and this is a mistake- I see a lot of players making is just a rush. You never you don't need to rush in a position like this. You can make all the necessary improvements, push that pass pawn down the board and then we're going to combine that with the other pass pawn. G3 knight defends the pawn, so he cannot take it with his bishop. Okay, this is a nice positional game. Actually, total domination. The king is perfectly safe because there's no. If he gives me a check, I can go to h6. He probably is going to give me a check. That would be my prediction, although okay rook a6 close so g2 check okay. So now what do we do? Who can tell me the move and now it's time to finally do something specific and and win some pieces? Oh nitro5 is a sexy move. Oh, I love that. I didn't even see that now my idea was to go rook to a1 and win as bishop that would have been possible. That would have been sort of the brute force method, but this man uh, is a savage. This knight is going to f3. What's the idea? Well, let's actually just ignore him. The idea is to get the knights f3 dislodge the king and then promote our pawn and make a queen we're not even bothering to win any of his pieces. Okay, king takes age. Six yeah and uh he's going to give up the rook for the night, but that doesn't help his cause because the game is over. Okay, look at this domination, rook's gonna move out and we're gonna. Finally, we can actually even take the bishop. We need to be careful now in such positions. Remember do not pre-move, because you might stalemate your opponent, be very careful when you've got a bunch of extra pieces about stalemating your opponent. That's why I don't recommend pre-moving too much unless you're absolutely sure that you haven't pre-moved, something which could lead to stalemate and the game is over. 48 moves and a nice game. Okay, so let's unpack this, he went c3. We went knight f6 now, bishop d3 is already in inaccuracy and bishop d7. Remember this idea. It should be seared in your memory by now, and I've shown you guys, those of you who are joining for the first time. What I like to do, sometimes during the speed run, is to show examples from real games that I played in over the board tournaments to show how I applied various ideas that I'm applying in the speed run and to show how how this kind of learning proceeds so the game that I always like to show when we have a tactic like this is the following game from 2010, which reached the following position. I had the black pieces against an international master. My rating back then, was 2356, so I was a master, but not yet a grandmaster. This position that you guys now see july 11th I played uh icelandic international master. He was rated exactly the same as I was rated and in this position very complicated position. He plays the move, uh bishop, to g5, trying to exert pressure on my knife who can spot my response, and some of you will remember this game. I don't mean to keep repeating it, but just want for the benefit of you know the new people to show this one more time knight takes d5 is correct, same exact idea. If um bishop takes c7, then well, it is a lecture. That's basically, my idea, knight takes c7 that same knight gives it a same knight that takes the pawn takes the bishop. If he takes the knight, then I take his bishop and the queen defense, the bishop on g5, which I applied in this game. It's literally the same thing on the other side of the board um. Thank you guys, I'm! I am very spoiled and thank you crazy zamarigali for the tier one knight takes c5 right same exact thing. It's just a slightly different version of it. Bishop is protected. Knight protects the bishop, literal trans position of the pattern, g6 stopping f5 fianchettoing, the bishop. We lock up the position first, we complete our development and we get the knight to e4. Now the typical mistake that I see players make in the 18 1900 rating range and and below is this tendency to automatically trade when you're up material, so you're taught when you're a beginner that, when you're up material pawn piece you want to simplify, you want to trade, and normally that's true, but I've insisted from the very start of the speed run that you should be very discriminating about how you go about trading. There's no need to trade, the knife, because our knight is much better than his night and that's why we get the knight to e4 kick his knight away, and now we get a brilliant good night against bad bishop situation, and this is like a textbook position. I've been on the receiving end of many such positions with a good knight, basically dominating a bad bishop. Can you give us an example? I hear you say I absolutely can, if you guys just give me one more second and again, I can't emphasize enough just how much it's important to to to approach your game seriously and to to try to learn from them, because then you're able to directly apply them. Look at the following position: almost exactly the same thing watch this. This is actually kind of cool. It's almost the same squares, just a slightly different position. Well, look at this! This is not from the speedrun game. I was black against the grandmaster 2009. look knight on d5, totally dominating completely dominating the bishop on d8 in the center of the board, supported by the pieces, the bishop has no prospects, and eventually it was precisely the night that one white, the game. I eventually got my bishop out, but I got checkmated. This was from a uh a night off, so coming back to the speed run, we see a different position. You know you don't want to over generalize, but it's very, very similar. The bishop is just terrible. The night is amazing and the night is on an outpost. It's completely unassailable. Okay, so essentially what we did now is we combined two plans. We attacked on the queen side and we attacked on the king side, but he basically helped us. He opened up the file which allowed this rook now to infiltrate at the correct moment to f1 rook takes g1 and we played it old school. We just traded the rope and took the pawn. That was not the only way to win. Could somebody find another possibility in this position? How else could I have transformed my position uh to to my favorite? I'm gonna show you guys another example from a very famous game. Thank you friend, 42 tier 1. Now we could have played knight to f2 moistevi. Thank you so much. I appreciate it exactly now. This is a fork he has to take the knight and then we play rook f1 takes f2. This is called piggies on the seventh. These rooks are going to massacre all of whites. Pawns checkmate is threatened. White has to create some air for his king, but basically black takes all of white's pieces and this is easily winning. Now here's the thing I promise last detour um. There was a very famous game, and the point that I want to make is this: when you have a good piece against a bad piece, such as a good night against the bad bishop right, what you want to be very careful about is making categorical statements like. I will never give up um! Well, you you never do want to give up in general, but I will never give up my good piece for my opponent's bad piece, because in chess you have to understand the concept of transforming your advantage going from one type of advantage to another, and what that sometimes requires is giving up a piece that looks really nice for one of your opponent's pieces that looks kind of bad and there was a very, very famous example of this by none other than the man. That's uh in the photo frame behind me bobby fisher, who was playing a match for the world championship um against? Well, not yet, but a candidate's match against tigran petrossian, and he did something very very similar here. You guys go here. We go bobby fisher white 1971, one of the most famous games actually of all time now this position occurred on the board between fisher petrossian. Now I want you guys to compare look at this beautiful piece outpost supported by a pawn in the middle of things. Thank you. G, dark side. Look at this pathetic little. Bishop yarny said not doing anything. Look at this pathetic bishop guess what bobby fischer does in this position? Guess what he does. He does something that shocked the players who were watching the game. They thought. Is he hallucinating? What did he do? He took it, damn girl. What are you doing bobby? He takes the bishop. What is he doing giving up this beautiful knight? He transforms the advantage because guess what he gets the c file and look very carefully at this pawn on a6. This is the pawn that he's going after what he's trying to do by taking the bishop he is removing the primary defender of the spawn petrossian would have put his bishop on b5 or back to c8 and he would have kept this pawn protected. So what fisher decides is I'm going to go after that pawn by trying to get my rook to c6, but trojan stops him, but much like in our game. Fisher gets one rook to the seventh rank and I'm gonna fast forward fast forward and he gets the other rook to the seventh round. So, quite literally, it's a very similar narrative here and he checkmates black petrosian resigned here because uh he cannot stop the rook maneuvering itself to h8. I don't want to go through the details of this, but that's just to show you guys that this kind of stuff happens all the time okay um, so that was that was that game. So back to the speed on transformation transformation of the advantage. Now we decided to go old school, taking the rook taking the pawn and just promoting our pawns. Now knight g5 was a really nice move, uh preparing, knight f3. We could have also gone to rook a1. That was my intention and taking the bishop and leaving us up a night. Okay, um. You were going to explain f5 instead of gc. Thank you for reminding me. It is in my notebook, I appreciate it. Why did I not just brute force, stop f5 with the five? Could somebody explain this to me narrative I like it. That is not the same tigran petrossian. Unfortunately, he passed away in the 80s the world champion. Today's tigran petrossian is a grand master, same name different person. We weaken the e6 pawn now. Actually, ladies and gentlemen, it's not queen h5 check. This is innocuous, because black can go g6 to block the check. Okay, so that's that is part of it, but that's not strictly speaking the reason. The reason is the pawn on e6 look at how weak it is and the definition of a weak pawn is upon. It cannot be protected by any other pawns right. That's the dictionary definition uh, but not all weak pawns are bad. It's just that this one is very easy to attack, because it's also an artery to the king got to be very careful about that, not a disaster. We can defend it, but why allow something like this? Why give white a target? Okay? Hopefully that makes sense. So that's why I played g6. Now this pawn is nicely protected. Rookie one is innocuous. We can just keep developing. So what's the lesson here be very careful about creating, what's called a backward pawn, a pawn, that's behind its neighbors, particularly one. That's next to your king. Every time you push a pawn out like this, especially the f pawn, just try to very quickly check to see whether you create any weaknesses and whether these weaknesses are easy to attack. Okay. What would you take with if he had pushed f5 well if he had pushed f5? I would have definitely taken the g pawn to keep that e file closed. I should definitely would not have taken to the e pawn and allowed something like this to happen. [Music] you.
