[Music] all right 1572 we're playing some serious opponents, guess what opening I'm gonna play? The king's indian? We had some requests. I'm gonna play the king's indian, which is an opening where you fee encounter your bishop as early as possible. Now in the well in the king's indian, as I've explained previously, it's what's called a hyper modern opening and in the hyper modern openings you give up a large share of the center and in return you try to attack the center from a distance with some of your pieces, in particular the bishop, the knight comes out, and you only claim control of the center when you're ready to do so. This is the concept that people don't always understand because it's not intuitive to not control the center. Your your conditions so early in your chest, career to control the center it looks like white is winning here I mean look at this. Oh we've got nothing. The reality is black is already better he's overextended himself. This is the essence of hyper-modern openings. When we strike in the center we mean business. The reason we mean business is because the reality is my pieces are positioned a lot better than my opponents. His bishop and his knight aren't really coordinated and he's basically going full steam ahead, engaging me in the center, but he's not ready for that. He's overextended, so watch what I do take d4 now. The first thing a lot of people will see is wait a second. He takes the knight and he wins a piece, because if I take the knight he takes the bishop, what did he miss? What do we do? 1500 is fine. That's when I started playing the king's indian, I wouldn't say it's good for total beginners, though I would recommend starting with a queen's gamut, very nice ef6 and we are in good shape, uh and, let's see now what's going on here, we are attacking two two pieces simultaneously. In addition, we have opened an avenue to his king. That is a very dangerous avenue. Okay and uh. He is in huge trouble. We are also going to be up upon because we have taken two pawns and he's taken zero. So we're going to be up a piece. We're going to be attacking him, uh, sorry, we're going to be up a pond, we're going to be attacking him and he's underdeveloped. We are crushing him in eight moves. This is why the king's indian is a great opening he's making it look good and we actually get to keep the king's indian bishop, so we can take with either piece uh. The reason I don't really want to take with the queen is maybe because he has knight t5 attacking the queen. So let's take with the bishop again keeping the queen for the more important tasks. I have two headphones. What do we do here? Uh? How do we continue, and I've already mentioned the move? We just have to put things in the right order. Oh look at this little juicy morsel right here. We're going to attack the hell out of that one exactly he has to play bishop d3 to defend, and then how are we going to follow up the attack on the knight on e4? What are we going to do to keep the attack on that going? Okay, all right, uh, sorry guys! He gives up that entirely. Okay, now, how do we convert such a position in the easiest manner? A lot of people want to take the pawn, I'm sure. No, no, no, no, no there's a higher priority. The priority is to stop him from castling. If we can stop him from castling, we are going to massacre him down the e-file. How do we stop him from castling? Now we can give a queen check, that's a great move, but let's do that in a slightly subtler way, let's play queen e7. This is the way that I like stopping him from castling, because it also builds the pressure on the e5. We kill two birds with one stone: do you guys see how often I try to do that when I have an intention that I'm trying to fulfill with the move, I'm trying to fulfill other intentions along the way with that same move? So if I'm trying to stop him from castling, I'm trying to find a move. That also is somehow conducive to my to my uh other goals. Okay, bishop f5 is possible, but we can attack the queen war directly. We can also play rookie iii uh. The queen must move and after the queen moves guess what that pressure down. The e file is finally going to bear fruit because we will be able to play what move do not forget about pawns as attackers. People always forget about pawns that and the fact that they can be full-fledged participants in an attack bingo goodbye bishop. He can't castle. He can't well, you can castle, but now it's too late. He loses the bishop miguel. Now he castles and the game is over. He loses two pieces uh, but remember what I kind of started the speedrun with what do you never forget to do when you're up a lot of pieces? What do you have to remember and remind yourself to do, and this is the reason a lot of people lose winning positions, yep very good, develop we, we haven't developed our queen side yet so let's do that. The win is going to be a lot easier if we have all of our pieces involved- and I like that people are whoa. Thank you for that. Okay, now we can even avoid developing, but I will not. I will complete the development and uh the game is over now. This is what the king's indian can get can give you. I mean a lot of extra pieces, we take another rook and now we take a knight, okay, we're up a couple of pieces here and now it's checkmate. That was a pretty smooth king's indian game man. This reminds me of why I play it. I wonder what our accuracy was. Our accuracy was probably perfect in this game, because all of our moves were relatively straightforward. Um. No, but again, let's not forget that these people are, you know they don't necessarily sign up to play me so uh. You know we have a good time, but at the end of the day I respect I respect all these people greatly for for playing me and you know being good sports about it which they are and their ratings are refunded. So again, I'm laughing, but it's all in good fun, I'm not trying to to make fun of anybody uh. You know these guys are capable of playing very, very well and giving me a run for for my money, okay, um, so quickly, let's go over this game because it wasn't that complicated. Now, a little bit of chess history when when was the first time the king's indian was ever played the first time that the king's indian was ever played. According to my research, according to my records is 1850, it was played by an early indian master named, but banerjee and banerjee, basically, okay. So this is super interesting guys, because this tells you a lot about chess history and the way that people thought 150 years ago. So watch listen to this, so the indian master, mohi sunder banerjee uh played a match against one of the strongest british players of the 1850s. His name was john cochran. John cochran was the most classic 19th century player. You could possibly think of. He did everything by the book and he actually developed the cochrane gambit, which is this move in the petra. By the way, this is a very interesting line. I highly recommend it to uh players in the 16 1700 range. It's actually not bad uh and it can be used to get a very interesting position in the petrov. So, let's put on our 1800 hats, let's imagine that we um that we are uh. I don't know, let's imagine that we're john cochran. I wish I had a book from the 1800s to show you guys, but I don't uh and okay. We just purchased my oldest book. Is this one and we just purchased this book yeah, so we're going to the board. However, they talk their hand. Our opponent in this game plays the king's indian. What is this opening he's, giving up all of the center? What does cochrane play in all of the games in this match? Knowing what you guys know about how people thought back, then? What do you think he did? What would what would somebody in the 1800s do here, knowing the chess principles that he knew back then excellent man, you guys, are sharp. This is like the well e5 no, but he would calculate these. People knew how to calculate. He played the four pawns attack, of course, because they were taught to control the center and I'm pretty sure that cochrane was probably laughing at this opening, because what the hell is black doing giving up such a monster center. The four pawns attack to this day is a pretty dangerous opening. Now, shall we check something interesting, so I don't click paid people into thinking. This was a chess history stream. This han booked a socks bills, modern chess openings written in the early 1900s. Shall we check what they thought of the king's indian? Let's check what they thought of the king's indian. I don't even know if it's analyzed, but let's see what they thought of the king's indian 120 years ago. Man this book is falling apart. We might need a german speaker, but I do know the german piece abbreviations. Let's have a look now, I'm going to the table of contents. Okay, so this is italian schweizer, e4 e4! I don't want e4. This is all e4 e4 this might. This might just be volume 1 with e4. Sadly, this is. I think this is just d4 defrosher. This is the french. No d4 wow e4 takes up this much and d4 takes up this much. This is really cool because they didn't take d4 seriously. Thank you, danny devito, for this up. Okay, so we have d4 queen's gambits. King's indian probably has like a page dedicated to it. This was only played a handful of times at that time. Okay, d4 just bear with me please for a moment, I'm trying to read this knight, f6 knight, f3, d6, bishop f4, knight, bd7, okay, so we're getting there one e3 one c4 rare moves. Yes, I have it d4 f5, they analyze the dutch wow. Look at this. You can see the mistakes being made in the book in the dutch they give the duchess an interesting opening and in the dutch they give this line, which is a line and then h6 is given an exclamation mark. This is a mistake. This is a mistake, bishop, h4 and now g5, which is a mistake, and now they give bishop g3. But white has a much better move in this position. What is white's move, and this move, I believe, refutes the line e4 boom e4 now, by the way they saw this idea because they didn't give f4 here, because e3 undermines the pawn. They didn't miss this idea, but they missed d4 in this position. D4 is very strong and if you take, then you get checkmated and black gets overextended here. So basically, there are mistakes. So, let's see martial election d4d5, I'm still seeing d4 d5 yeah d4 spring at f6, so knight f6 was such a rare move that they basically consign it into like non-existent. Okay, footnote number two m85, okay, black, probably transposes schlechter played this. I don't care which left we played one g6 one b6 white plays e4, come on guys, you didn't analyze the king's indian step up your game. I think we should write these people. Whoever wrote this book. I know they're all dead now, but this is ridiculous. No, they didn't analyze it. The king's indian is literally not analyzed, it's just the dutch and then like rare openings. No, it is kind of analyzed wow. They analyzed some interesting stuff. Actually, marshall pillsbury yeah, basically relegated to the king's indian, is relegated to a footnote because in the year that this game was played, the king's indian had only been played and there's the reason why now here's the reason? No, no, no. No. This book was published in 1918 over 100 years ago and at the time that this game was published, the king's indian had been played only excluding banerjee, excluding the indian master, who played it against cochrane and that match might not have been published or might not have been known to these guys, excluding that game at the time that this game was that this book was written, guess how many times the king's indian had been played. I'm counting right now guess how many times the king's indian had been played at the time. This book was written six. It was played six times before 1922. and then the last time was 1912 18. It was one time in 1879, 1880 1880, 1883 tarash played it in 1885.. How forward thinking was that guy? Can you guys imagine- and this is what I tell everybody- who disrespects the classics and as stein? It's you know, capital blank attarash, they all kind of sucked, guess what imagine being the first freaking person to play the king's indian, the first person to realize that you could give up the entire center the entire center when everybody was laughing in your face these? This is why I I really respect the classics, because we stand on the shoulders of giants. We know all this stuff, but imagine walking into a room or a playing hall and playing something and everybody's looking over your shoulder. Who is this idiot playing this stuff? So that's why the classics are great, because somebody had the guts to walk into a playing hall and be the first person to play the king's india, okay and they did it without computers and we got jayru gifting a sub as well to ziffer. Sorry, I get worked up about this because I'm really into history, but that's why this is so interesting and imagine the effort that it took to write a 780 page book in 1918 on chess openings. I mean the guy who wrote this is a frickin rock star. Imagine how grateful people were to buy this stuff and imagine how much of an edge it would give people to read it and then there's the eight queen problem. There's a lot of stuff here, there's not just openings. I mean I wish I could speak german there's like some chess studies and stuff um, there's there's just a lot. This is just like jam-packed with cool stuff games. Ooh somebody made it. Somebody made a note with a pen wow. Somebody made a note here with a pen. This could have been written a hundred years ago. Somebody somebody pointed out a different move in the margins with a pen. Oh and this book belonged to frank, roy's md, so this book is inscribed to a medical doctor. Who is a famous surgeon died? I think, 15 years ago from portland- and I got this from the mechanics institute in san francisco uh from my mentor john donaldson 1873., so this was written originally in 1873. This is the second edition published in 1916., but this was originally written 150 years ago wow. This is so cool. There's like notes here in pencil- and these notes are in german wow, so this this these were notes by whoever owned this before this guy uh. What did the notes say? No, nothing! It's just like moves. It's just like moves uh, but well anyways. I I have more of this stuff. I'll just need to find it, but basically that's that's that sorry to go in the rabbit hole, but this is really cool. I think let me file this away. This is the oldest thing I have thank you uh slant and shunt. How much does that book cost? I don't think it says, but it's a beautiful it's a beautiful book, it's falling apart, but look at the effort that was put into the cover handbook of openings and then there's uh, there's table of contents and then there's a symbols. Oh and look at these people. They actually have uh question marks and castle long. So even in the 1870s they were using algebraic, notation uh. So you know people haven't really changed. You can see someone just reading this casually 100 years ago, okay, um. The second oldest thing I have is before the time of beth harmon, and I've already showed this. This is a bound copy of the 1946 chess review. This is chess review was the monthly magazine of the us chess federation, and I have the 1946 bound copy. There's some really cool photos in here. This, for example, is arturo pomar, a spanish kid who would later go on to become a grandmaster. I always look like looking at the prices and stuff, as I mentioned, and some of the articles, an invitation to chess by irving, chernov and kenneth harkness. It cost it cost two dollars two dollars to buy a hard copy book sportsman for tone, tempo, there's, grooming essentials, dr alexander alakine wow. This is so interesting. Soviet union there's chess news. Four famous books cost 250, that's awesome, yeah! I know that's like in in that money. It's it's a lot more, but it's just funny pawn snatch refuted chess marches on alakine on the cover died. This is the this is the the magazine. Those came out after alekhine died in 1946.. He was on the cover of the next chess review. Article. Don't forget to get a good night of rest. Oh never! Never! A grandmaster house! If you can't sleep, try this interesting. Let your jaws, relax, wow, so alakine had died. On march 24th, a radio news flash announced the death of world champion alexander alekhine at the age of 53 in lisbon. First reports described his death to a heart ailment, but a subsequent autopsy disclosed that death had been caused by asphyxia due to an obstruction in his breathing channels due to a piece of meat yeah. So that's the that's. The prevailing theory about his death is that he was already in bad health. This was amplified by an associated press dispatch yeah there there's a photo of him when alakine was found dead on sunday in the hotel esteril, he held a piece of beef steak. In his right hand, intimates said friends said: alekhine was accustomed to eating with his hands, never using knives or forks when he could avoid them and that he would eat alone when he wanted complete enjoyment from a meal. At the time of his death, alekhine was working on his memoirs and playing training games with a francisco weapon. Now this doesn't tell the whole story because edward winter, one of the leading chess historians believes that uh alekhine well alekan was already in bad health. He was basically broke a very tragic story, but he was basically broke uh and he was in. He was in poor health. So basically the the actual story is is more complicated, uh but anyways. This is just interesting, okay, uh. So let's do one more round of the speed run, and then I have commentary indeed with robert at 9 00 a.m tomorrow. So I do want to get a good night of sleep. Okay, uh! Let's do one more round of the speed and we have over a thousand people. So a big shout out to everybody watching and a huge thank you to everybody who was a participant in the earlier epic stream uh. I still haven't fully recovered from that um, okay, but um back then, like you didn't he was living in the hotel like he was, I think back then, like the meaning of a hotel was kind of different 50 years ago in hastings, I have like more stuff chess ratings. Oh postal chest ratings. I think only correspondence chess ratings existed back then um over-the-board chess ratings did not. Okay. Let's continue. Let's continue. Are you guys ready now that we have all this chess history in front of us? Let's honor the greats with one more solid round of the speed run as we got kolarn with a tier one, sub keeps it going on the path to 4 000. I can't believe I'm saying this, but we are over 3 000 subs, I'm using my earliest chess notebook to collect people's questions. We've got present past and future with us right now. Hopefully, the future generation of chess players in the chat. Let's continue danny k. Okay, we have been playing the accelerated dragon, which I think people are getting behind. Oh j root, 1500 bits thanks man with a monster bomb right there thanks man. Okay uh, so, as people already know, this move, bishop c4 is not effective against the sicilian. For what reason? What is the move? And if you know the move, then by definition, you know kind of the reason that this move is good. You can play e6, but the reason is not that we can play d5. The reason is that e6 blunts the bishop and we don't even have to rush with them. I mean we'll play d5, but we don't have to rush for the move. With the move d5, we can also develop our knight uh, which we will do now. So we are just the reason I'm playing fast is because I'm I'm simply developing my pieces. This check is useless because I would have developed it anyway and now the queen could be in the crosshairs of what. What should we do here? How do we at least try to punish him for this untoward and sort of slightly awkward move? We can play rookie and we immediately create the pinning potential he has to which he does castles now. The first thing we would check uh for in this position is a discovery and bishop d6 comes to mind. I'm sure some people are thinking this, but uh. Remember that when you discover a piece you can move the piece and defend the other piece. So if bishop d6, the queen, can come out to d2 and simultaneously protect the bishop, so there's no point in making this discovery, let's save it for a rainy day. Now, when I say save it for a rainy day, I mean let's, instead complete our development, now again remember to apply the key principle when you're developing your pieces do not obstruct the stuff that you want to keep. So where should we put this bishop, let's put it on f5, let's put it on f5 and let's see what he does, maybe bishop d6 will become good again, for example, if he plays knight bd2, I don't think he will, but if he plays knight bd2 for whatever reason, uh bishop d6 will win a piece he goes queen d2. He gets afraid of the discovery. Now. Okay, the nereditsky approach here is to identify what do I have against sunny day who you're still phoning robert man, if only I was commentating with him tomorrow. So the the neredinsky approach is to see that the pawn on h3 is what I is what's called a hook and a hook is a pawn that is outside of its normal position near a king that can be used either as a lever to sacrifice on or for other pawns to advance and then to use that pawn to weaken the king position. So let's go queen d7 and just sack on h3 opening up his king position. Our queen will be in the attack. It's a very typical idea in all sorts of positions, particularly in ones where you've completed your development and the reason the sacrifice is not that risky is because we get two pawns for the piece. So, even if the attack backfires, we will have a significant amount of material for the piece now. Is this sacrifice sound? I don't think so. I don't think it is particularly sound, but I don't think it's bad because we're attacking his knight his queen is super awkward. He would love to play knight bd2 here, developing his knight and defending the knight on f3 but uh. Sadly, he cannot and uh. We also have this g4 square available for the queen. Should the occasion arise, speedchest championship tomorrow, all right so queen d1. Now how do we increase the pressure and the heat on the king side? How do we add some tabasco sauce to the attack? How do we add some tabasco sauce yeah? Let's add some tabasco sauce. Let's add some tabasco sauce now be careful about the idea of knight e4 because remember that his bishop also controls h2, his bishop also controls h2. So it's not that simple uh and in fact I would take on d5 if I were white just fearlessly, but people just don't play like this. I guess he proved me wrong normally, but um. We have some really cool ideas here. Actually we have some really cool ideas here. So what can we do in this in this position? How can we play so? Bishop h4 uh would be a great idea if it weren't for well the presence of the knight on f3. If it weren't for the presence of the knight on f3, then we would be able to go. Bishop h4 and bishop takes f2. So how can we? How can we pave the way for the bishop to come to h4? Can we distract this knight from f3 yeah? We can we can. We can go knight t4 now. This is again. This is on sound. He can refute this and win uh if he plays very accurately so I'm banking on the fact that he doesn't play accurately uh because he's 1573, but I would not do this against a gm, for example, I'm just trying to show how attacking works and often in blitz. You can get away with stuff like this. So, let's see how he reacts to this now we're trying to distract this knight so that we can put a bishop on h4 and threaten checkmate on f2 when you're attacking you want to make sure that not only are you bringing pieces into the game but you're doing it in a very targeted way. You want to do it in a way that such that the pieces actually accomplish something you go c3. He doesn't take the knight. So if we take his knight he takes with the queen, we certainly don't want that. We don't want the queen trade um, but this knight from d4 can actually go somewhere kind of nice. Where can this knight from d4 go so that it's still kind of relevant in the attack go to f5 uh and on f5 it potentially can go to h4 and again distract the knight from f3? Should the occasion arise and queen g2 checkmate will be threatened, so we're sort of staying on idle idol? Isn't we're idling the engine here and we're actually threatening knight h4, because he takes on h4 we will kill two birds with one stone. We will move the bishop in and that bishop will threaten checkmate on f2. So, let's see how he chooses to defend against that. You guys can begin to appreciate here how difficult it is to defend against the style of play. Even if an attack is unsound from an engine's perspective for a human being to defend against all this stuff is incredibly difficult. Uh is incredibly difficult. I know that express I don't like that expression either, but he's doing it incredibly well so knight to e5 uh okay. So how should we proceed? How should we proceed? Should we take the knight? So we, if we go bishop h4, he he can take on on g4? Ah, this is very nice. We can actually go bishop h4. I think this actually takes some calculation from me, but we can actually go bishop h4. So here's the calculation is not that difficult um, because we are threatening checkmate. He can take our knight with two different pieces. He can take it with the queen or he can take it with a knight. If he takes it with the queen, then as I've explained many times, he should always check for the undefended pieces. The rook only one loses its support, so we actually do take the queen. Then we take on e1. We win the rook that same rook pins his knight to his rook. So even though he has two pieces for a rook, we have some compensation. The second way that he can take is with a knight, but then his queen is overloaded. It guards both g4 and e1, so we can take on e1 and then take on g4. This is the third move, but this doesn't do much. We just move the king away and the problem is renewed. The king is perfectly safe. He decides on this move, so now we will win the rook back. He does get rid of the attack, but in return uh the attack in a certain sense continues: let's bring our other piece into the game rook to f8 attacking the bishop, so this is again a very combative game. Our opponent played extremely well. He defended extremely well, but he's still far from out of the woods, because this rook anyone look how it's paralyzing his entire position and that this, I believe, was a mistake. Well, actually not, but again we can well. We can test him a little bit. Let's test him a little bit. Yeah 97 is the move that I had in mind: uh attacking both bishops. At the same time, if he moves his bishop to d2, which would be, I believe, the right move, then we can actually win back the two pieces for a rook we can play rook takes b1 and then take the other bishop with our knight he finds. Instead, the move bishop to d6, okay, so he's pinning our knight to our rook. If we take his bishop, he takes a rook. So let's move the rook away from the pen uh simultaneously trying to transfer the rook to g5 and attack the knight on g4 and pinning the knight. So let's see what he ends up doing in this position see what he ends up doing in this position. Okay, uh he's taking a little bit too much time and if you're actually trying to improve at blitz, you can notice that the style of play makes it very difficult for people to come up with moves fast and so, in a certain sense. It's favorable to play like this, because uh, because by definition you're you're you're sucking the time off of your opponent's clock. Now. What can we do here? Let's go rook g5, yes, the move is king and now what do we do after he moves his king, recognizing that the rook is pending the night? What do we do? I lived there freshman year or sorry sophomore year. How do we enhance the attack on the night we got booked and we take the night and we are in very good shape. We are up in exchange, so this was only 26 moves which is kind of interesting because it looked much longer. There was a lot of interesting moments. How could he have refuted this attack, so the key moment occurred in. I think this position had he taken the knight on d4. We would have played bishop to h4, threatening checkmate on f2, and in this position I believe he could have played the move bishop to g2. The purpose of this move is to attack the queen and to open up the f1 square for his king. We can still take on f2, but he shifts his king to f1. There's a lot going on here, but basically this boils down to two simple facts. Fact one is that white is up two pieces, so white can give away something and he can still be up. Material fact two is that black's queen is hanging. So if I take on e1 he takes with his queen. We have a situation where both queens are hanging in such situations. As I've explained, you want to look for desperado sacrifices, giving up your queen for the maximum. We can do that with queen takes g2. The problem, as I've explained, goes back. To fact, one white is up two pieces white is no longer up two pieces, but he is still up one and I have some pawns for it, but by and large it's an end game. So white is much better okay. So again, this is one of those things that looks super complicated, but it's not that hard to calculate and people shouldn't be afraid of this kind of chaos, because you really want to zero. In on the observations that that make a position tick, you want to kind of really figure out. What's going on and uh, you shouldn't, you shouldn't be afraid, just because of the way that a position that a position looks. Okay, all right great. So let's do maybe one more game um one! Second, please! So, if you played accurately he would have been better. Yes, that's what I'm saying, but I warned you guys. That's why I believe the sacrifice was unsound and if I was playing a gm I would have probably played p5 to try to drive his bishop in with c4. That would have been a good. You know that would have been a solid move just to improve the position you could have also dropped the bishop away to fa. You'll see this idea very often in gm games. Opening up the open file for for the rook could have also gone well. H6 might allow the reciprocal sacrifice. On the other side. A lot of you said fifa. Can you play cochrane gabby? Yes, the next time our opponent plays the petrov, I will play play the cochrane game, but I'm ready to destroy a 1600 this time who plays the scandinavian okay. Now in the scandinavian we know already that knight c3 is the best move to attack the queen and develop a knight. Now we occupy the center with d4, and now we follow the ancient wisdom of petrov who said to develop the knight uh to f3. First, I don't think we played this guy. Actually, I disagree now he's just moving his pawns and there is no particular way in which we should respond. No, no. We did not play this guy, the last time uh. There is no particular way that we should respond to this other than to continue development. Uh. Are you sure we played him? Well, I'm looking at my game history. I don't see him but anyways. Bishop d3 is simple. Oh, it's just the overlay hasn't changed there. We go the over. That's so weird. It contained the name of the last opponent, but the moves are transmitted transmitting correctly. Okay, so let's centralize the knight that was really funny and develop our bishop. So right now, I'm just developing all my pieces, I'm not doing anything crazy, which is why I'm moving fast. Okay. Now? What should we do in this yeah? I was like what what should we do in this position? Let's bring our queen out to f3, which is a very typical way to apply pressure on his position, notice that I'm also giving up the d4 pawn, and there is a reason that I'm doing that and the reason that I'm doing that is because he's so poorly developed if he takes on d4 with his queen, his queen is going to be incredibly vulnerable to attack. Now. What should we do in this position? We can win a pawn. It's the rye lopez demon. It's ray lopez loose pieces drop off boom. If he takes, we take the bishop loose pieces drop off, that's a free pawn. There's no reason not to take it. Okay, he goes knight d5, so he attacks the bishop. Let's take it now. We do need to move the knight away. So let's move it back to c3. Okay, so we're up pawn we're in good shape. He's probably gonna. Go here. Nope he's gonna go f6, okay! Now what should we do in this situation and I'll give you guys a hint? We can create a counter threat against his pawn on h7, because we have a bishop on t3. That's very, very strong. A lot of people might think the move is queen h5, but be very, very careful, because if we oh, we got another. Oh my goodness! Oh my lance got another one from gem jam, another 10 000! Are you kidding me? I will have a good night. We're gonna go queen h3, so that g6 doesn't come with tempo. What a day this has been in, culminating in two bombs dropped by gem jim now we're going to move our knight away now that we've provoked the weaknesses in his king side and king h8 pin. What does this tell us about what we should do? Thank you so much. What should we do here boom if he will take his opponent on g6? Yes and the game is almost over. That is the second and again we do the same thing we did earlier. We just take a pawn and we drop the bishop back. Okay. Now we have a really nice tactic. How do I see this tactic? What I'm seeing is that the queen defends the pawn on h7 against checkmate. We know that when the queen defends a pawn, that's not a good situation, we can take a third pawn and if he takes the queen, oh sorry, if he takes the knight we can take on h7 and the game will be boy and lodge the game will be over now, he's gonna go knight 97.. Now most people here would take the rook. The thing about this is: we can do a lot more than take the rook. We can do a lot better because we have this h file open. We can attack down that h file following the ancient wisdom of the greats with knight takes h7. We don't need to take bishop takes h7, because if bishop h7 we give up the knight and that same knight can be used to go to h7 himself, and this is just going to be completely winning. We are up four pawns and we are crushing him with an attack. Okay, now, let's find the checkmate. He has also given up his rook, but there is mate in two moves. How do we find the checkmate? We realize that we can move the knight away with a discover check. Our second mission in this position is to cover the g8 square, because after we move the knight that is going to be his only escape square for the king and that's how you often, when you're discovering a check- and you want to checkmate your opponent's king- the way that you want to think about the discovers. Can I move my piece away such that that very same piece somehow contributes the mating mechanism. As you guys can see, the move is knight f6 check. The game is over it's mate, very simple game. We just developed our pieces, and this is why I don't recommend opening such as this candy to a lot of players in the intermediate range because they tend to do stuff like this, giving us a huge lead in development. The one thing I'd like to talk about is what would have happened if we had if he had gone queen takes d4. Now, when you look at this move, the immediate thing you should notice is the relationship between the queens. So if this bishop could move away with check, then that would win the queen. So you need to find a tactic in order to force the king onto a square where you could deliver check to. This looks like a complicated combination, but the logic behind it. No pun intended is very simple: you're just trying to get the king onto a square or you can deliver the discovery check. So he couldn't do this and that meant he had to allow us to continue putting our pieces on very good squares. Now we play knight takes p5 using the fact that the bishop is unprotected. We drop the knight back, we attack h7. If he had taken the knight we take it check and checkmate is very simple. We can even checkmate with the pawn d takes c5 and um after knight g4, I mean his position has already been softened up. We take on g6, we take on f6 distracting the queen notice, how our own queen- and I've mentioned this often the queen is often sort of the supporting actress. A queen, defends on g2 and simultaneously is responsible for uh, basically he's the agent of of checkmate. What if he took the pawn later? That's a good question. So if he took the pawn here, we would have just defended the knight and then brought the other look. How amazing white's position is uh even upon down. So basically, this is just completely overwhelming, because white's got pieces on amazing squares and you can slide the queen over to h3 and create threats against the h7 pawn. So if he goes h6, you can already give a discovery and win the queen uh. What, if yeah so there's, there's a bunch of tactical details here, but the long and short of it is that white's got a huge attack and the rest was very straightforward. Now, just moving knight back to f6 and covering g8, we could have also taken the rook, of course, with total devastation, but we decided to play a little bit more precisely.
