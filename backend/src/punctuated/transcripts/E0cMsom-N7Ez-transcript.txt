Yeah three seconds per move is also what uh, what does it? Okay, okay, 2400. Let's focus. We are playing a 23.79 guys, yar! Thank you. So much teleportivo with the tier one and we are gonna, play the king's indian. Okay, all right guys, I'm a little concerned. This guy has won like 50 out of his last 52 games, but okay, so h6, I don't know what this is. This is a weird move: we're just gonna chase the knight away. I've never seen this before, but we're going to give her the benefit of the doubt. 5 000 bits, fidius gage holy smokes. Oh my lands, girl, bishop, g7, okay, knight, e5, okay, uh, fine, he's just shuffling his knight or a knight c4. So this is a good um. This is a good time for me to practice what I preach when our opponent does weird stuff like that, I'm not gonna change my strategy, I'm just gonna, play normal moves. I'm just gonna develop my pieces and, let's let him die by his own sword. Okay, he's trolling! So the knight on a5, let's apply natural concepts is undefended. What can we do? Our queen x-rays, the knight, that's something you guys should see, so we can go c5 open up the attack on the knight and contest the center, we're going to take on d4 and we're going to very quickly occupy the center with our pawns yeah. I don't like it when people do this, because that often means they start playing really well at some point now we're going to develop the knight and sack the queen. Some of you may have noticed that the bishop x-ray is the queen, but we wouldn't have had a good discover check okay, queen on a4. How do we exploit it? What should we do? What should we do all right, guys, no innocent until proven guilty right now he's playing terribly. If he starts playing brilliantly, I will let you know: e3, okay, let's just wait and see so uh. You know we're gonna play normally here. Uh, there's many ways that we can go about playing this uh. The default should be to just activate your pieces, so we're going to activate the rook and put it on the semi-open file, where it basically pressures the c2 pawn and uh we're going to see how he responds to the queen. H4 get out of here, get out get out and get out of that get out of here. A non-smurf yeah anon would totally be doing this queen to c4. Okay, um well he's trying to confuse me, but you know it's very important. Thank you. Phineas. Once again, let's go 95 to centralize the night, we're going to keep improving our pieces marginally, eventually something's, going to manifest itself now we're going to bring the bishop into the game with bishop f5 and we're going to tuck it away on g6, potentially okay, now this night on c3, you guys see that night right. We want to make sure that night is gone. What should we do? We use our knight and we put it on e4, but let's focus on the game guys. It doesn't matter that he's trolling. This is good practice, because you're gonna you're gonna play people who are like that. Okay, knight to b5, it's actually not that easy to refute his moves. I I know that sounds crazy. Let's get our queen into the game, let's get the big boys into the game. Let's get the big boys into the game. Now we're gonna park, our bishop back on g6 yeah he's actually not playing that belly. I mean it's he's he's not blundering anything. Okay, now he's attacking our knight. We gotta move our knight back back to c5 yeah. I know it sounds absurd, but he's actually not blundering and now he's playing well. H4 is a good move, he's undermining our pawn now. What should we do here? Well, what I'm noticing here is the knight on b3 right, let's send our pawn into a5, let's try to attack that knight get it out of b3 so that the queen could reinforce its attack on. I don't like this one bit, ladies and gentlemen, but we'll see um we're still I mean black is better here. I you know knight takes c5 okay. So what should we take with? What should we take this? So I can take with a bunch of pieces. I can take with a rook, but let's take with the pawn to chase away his knight. His knight is his only good piece so using logic, we're gonna take with a pawn, but knight p5 would be a good move here that one I actually didn't quite anticipate: okay, let's slice off the connection to his knight with a pawn holy smokes 10 bucks. Thank you. So much ethan olden appreciate it. Okay, he defends the knight um, let's get a rook into the game, let's get our last remaining piece into the game of the lookout to d8 and we are already setting up a potential knight sacrifice on d3 okay, so he goes knight d4. So one thing that I would consider doing here if from a gm level, is actually to sacrifice the knight. This is dania's style. I'm not gonna do quite as much explaining as I usually do, because I'm a little bit bemused, okay, let's go knight d3 check sacrificing the night. Why do I do this because I feel like I have so many active pieces that this has to work. Look at all of my pieces in the game. We've talked about the scenario before okay. So what should we do now? Hmm, this knight is the annoying piece. This knight is the annoying piece I'll give you guys a hint. Let's get this knight out of the picture e5 we could have taken with the bishop, but I don't want to give away my really nice, bishop, okay. Ah, that's a very good move, though, because eddie he wants to play e4 and he wants to lock things up. He sacrifices back the piece and he wants to lock everything up. That's a really strong idea. Now we're going to bring the rook up to defend the pawn on g5 we're going to bring the rook up to defend the pawn on g5. I think I'm still doing fine here, queen to e2, okay um, let's double on the c file, let's double on the c file [Music] and now um, let's uh, let's snag the pawn: let's snag the pawn on b2 all right, guys, relax everybody queen to a2. He attacks our queen. We move our queen away and now um. Well, I think we can take another pawn. Queen takes a four okay uh. Now I think that we can uh hmm. What should we do here? Well, I think that one thing we can do is we can uh. We can try to trade rooks. We can try to create a pair of bricks, get his active rook out of its active square. I did kind of blunder the pawn, but that's a worthy price to pay for getting us rid of his activities. He, of course takes it. Uh yeah, uh, hmm. Now, let's get our rook to an open file. Rook, b7, okay f4 makes a lot of sense. Okay, queen a3, I'm gonna try to set this up. Okay. What is this? Oh bishop, d2, of course, okay? Well, I can drop my bishop back. That's okay, f6, oh my god, rook h7 and e5 yeah. Well, you guys can see the difference. You know when okay, but bishop g5 wait a minute, let's not give up yet I want to take on. I want to take on d2. I don't see a defense for him. I don't see a defense for him. Rook here check, mmm wait a minute! This is unclear. Actually, I might be winning. No, something is up, but I don't know what it is exactly queen: d6 e5, oh my god, and if he takes and he's got, is he checkmating me there? Oh, my god, that's ridiculous! Actually, let's play king f8. Let's get the king out! No no 2700 plays like this guys. I don't know. The other thing is some people play like this. They psych me out queen h5 is an amazing move because he wants e5, but I can give him a check. I gotta try to flag him here: king g4, oh my god. Damn girl now he's got this check and he wins. Oh, my god. Yes and queen f7 three seconds on that move and then three seconds e5. Oh hi, e5, oh my god, it's hilarious, [Music], rook, c8 and bishop d8 is mate. Oh my god! That's so funny guys I mean this. Guy is actually hilarious. Oh my god. He blunted her up wait. I think he turned it off. Oh my god! No, it's me holy smokes. It's actually mate. He wins king c7. He had bishop f4 and he thinks in this position. Oh, my god, that's actually so funny guys. Okay, let's I gotta practice what I preach. We're not gonna report him, we're gonna, look with stockfish a point I wanna make to everybody. How do you deal with something like this before you report anybody? We have to leave the possibility that I was so psyched out by this, that he made a bunch of mistakes and I thought they were computer moves because we had made up our minds so, let's first look with chess base and our real stock fish. Obviously, what makes this suspicious is the fact that he crushed me out calculated me and he uh. He did it after a horrible opening when he was lost. Not a lot of people could do that, but uh we have to leave that possibility open. So let us um practice that and look at the game. Obviously um it is. He made it extremely extremely obvious what he was doing, but we have to practice innocent until proven guilty. It's magnus would not play like this. That's what you guys need to understand it. It's not about. Oh, this guy could be magnus. It's the playing style. The playing style is what makes this the most improbable. It has nothing to do with. Oh. If it was magnus, then he could play like this magnus doesn't play like this look guys. You understand what I'm saying yeah and that's a very typical technique that new people have been doing, which is to play nonsense. Moves at the start to evade the automated suspicion, because it will show a very low accuracy because he played terribly at the start. You understand what I'm saying and then once he starts doing it um then he's quote unquote evaded suspicion. What he doesn't realize is he's playing me. Okay, so I've I've set up the scene yeah, so danny has talked about it, but basically five bucks. Thank you easy. Now. We knew that we would uh. We would encounter these kinds of people and and and that's okay. Okay, let me just um, so I don't actually think I played badly either. That's the funny thing. I think I played quite well okay, so you guys now can see stockfish, okay. So let's look at stockfish. 92 is really good. Okay, so let's go from this position, so he's minus three, which is winning rook c8 quinn h4, queen c4. Okay, let's start here: let's start here, queen e2 knight, c3, knight, v5 is top look at this knight. B5 guys knight, 5 d4 is second f3 is fine, although h4 is basically top eight. This is a mistake. Hg and knight takes. C5 is second yep. No that's first, now, first or second knight, b5 a4 is first or second we're gonna go by the top two moves, because he could use a slightly different computer. Oh you know he's losing here, I'm actually winning. I actually came very close to beating him so, and this was a mistake. E5 was a mistake. I should have gone rook c2. Bishop d3 is top e4 stop queen e2 bishop d2 king f2 is top top top top. I don't know f6 is top though rook h7 rook h5 is top okay yeah, he definitely cheated. Quinn h5 is top top bishop g5, and now he had this smurf move brook b8 yeah. So basically he he he went on and off like he made some moves on his own. I came very close to beating him. Nonetheless, I missed one big chance here. Um I made I missed one big chance. Your rook c2 would have been very strong yeah. I just didn't realize that this was winning, but obviously uh, 681 volt yeah. No, no, it's obvious that he cheated uh. I won't even pretend to have any suspicions we'll report him um and uh. This is yeah. He made it. He made it very, very obvious, with three seconds of move and how he played in the end. That's what makes it obvious yeah three seconds per move is also what uh, what does it? Okay, I'll write them? A personal message. Sorry guys did you have to sit through this. I hope that I have been reasonable and I hope I didn't make the accusation in an unfounded manner. I've shown my method uh to be very clear. The reason that I am confident that he cheated consists of several things. The first is that he played a terrible opening, followed by an abundance of computer, moves and critical moments. Three seconds per move, and mainly I would not have been uh convinced, had we not seen his play in the final stage of the game. This is where he started playing topmost. Look at his time four seconds, four seconds, five seconds, one. Second, four: eight seconds: seven seconds: four seconds: 20 seconds on the best move four seconds on king q4, four, four, four: four: it's the typical sign in rook ba. Nobody would ever play this move. He knows that it's winning, but he gives up the rook just to kind of smurf the engine. Okay. No, it's not possible trust me on this one: okay, that is unfortunate, um, that this happens, but um yeah. So I was winning with rick t now. I knew this would be sketchy too. Once he played knight g5, you already know, something's gonna be wrong, maybe and unfortunately yeah. We knew we knew I knew too, but I have to. I have to give people the benefit of the doubt. You know I can't make any conclusions [Music] now and before I get off the soapbox and play one last one. I want to make one thing very clear, which is that if you guys are playing a cheater, I want to really want to make this fleet from the bottom of my heart. Do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, not because I'm trying to be holier than that, but because I co take take my word for it. Firsthand uh to get accused of cheating when you didn't cheat is very frustrating very dangerous, um and, and we want to make sure that not as frustrated as you may be in the frustration as human. I feel that that anger in my chest, when I feel like somebody's cheating, it's terrible uh, but you do want to go by the evidence and you want to give the people the benefit of the doubt. Uh and- and you know you have to understand that sometimes the anger can come from a normal place, but sometimes people truly can play well and I'm not trying to garner any. You know any points for manuel he's, so moral, but I've made this mistake myself and uh. I feel like this is the best way to be. Thank you. Twitch, prime username, okay, it really is innocent until proven guilty and we have to practice that in chess too. Okay, that's why I decided to show my exact method, which is to check with stockfish and to look at his time. Consumption per move, which is very, very revealing chess.com, will do the rest, okay um. Well, obviously the consequences can be that you could falsely bend, but chess.com is a great algorithm. They don't do that, but that's just the mentality that I advocate to everybody. Why not take white bishop a few moves ago? Um? Well, if I took the bishop, where oh you mean here well, because if you take the bishop he's got queen e5, followed by bishop b5, I mean the insane thing I mean all rook h5 is pretty insane, although it's understandable, but to realize that this is losing- and this is made it's crazy and then king g4 instantly is is just remarkable. Like windy, six, oh wait! I played this really good move. If you're a human, you would calculate king h2. I don't even know why you didn't play this move. King g4 instantly is ridiculous. Next game, guys, let's move on, I think we've all had our moment of fun. This will happen a couple of times uh in the speed run and that it is what it is. Okay, let's go well twitch, prime um uh. You know, I'm perfectly calm, just uh, you know yeah, okay, so let's go up let's go on and I knew that when a 2400 plays a 2000, that's already pretty sus to be good. That was a really good game. King h2, queen d65 2258. Thank you, kalis kintodra, okay, let's try another king's indian. Let's try another king's indian back to the game, guys! Okay! So we're going to play the king's indian. He plays the fiance variation. He plays the fiance variation. Now I've explained the main moves in the king's indian many times and in terms of where you develop. This knight there's two possible squares, c6 and d7, and one important thing about playing the king's indian at a high level, the the move knight c6, can sometimes backfire. What is the reason? What annoying response does white have against knight c6, and that is the move d5 exactly so knight. Bd7 is actually very typical in the king's indian to prepare e5. That knight is very safe, but I hear you guys saying well what about the bishop on c8 we're going to get that bishop in due time and I'm going to show you guys a really interesting line here. We go c6 to control the d5 square and the other idea of the move c6 is to deploy the queen to a5. This is my main line actually and at the right moment we take on e5, and now we put the knight on e5. This is all fury, so I'm going a little bit fast, but every one of these moves, I hope, is understandable too now we attack the c4 button and pressure his center. As you guys can see. This is a hyper modern opening, because he's got a lot more of the center than I do, but look at how I'm attacking both of his pawns with my pieces this night, pressuring that pawn this night pressuring that pawn and what the battle is going to revolve around here is whether or not he's going to be able to beat back my initiative. Now we need to deploy our rook to e8 in order to prepare to increase the pressure on the e-pawn. If we want him to play f4, that's a move, a lot of people would play automatically. Could somebody explain to me the drawback of the move? F4, okay, um? Let's move on we'll do that after the game. Let me write this down. Okay. So now what we need this knight on d4 is very active. Can we try to compel him to get this knight out of the picture and we also accomplish a secondary goal of increasing the pressure on the e pawn and we also develop a piece. So we do a lot of things now. C5 guys would be a very common mistake. C5 would weaken the d5 square very significantly. Okay c5 would weaken the d5 square. Let's find a slightly more subtle method of doing it. Well, queen c5 ooh, queen c5, is actually a really good move. Oh yeah yeah guys we're moving on wait a minute. I actually saw something really cool. Let me think: let's do this. This is a very tricky move, guys I thought of bishop e6. Initially, bishop e6 was what we wanted to play initially, but now somebody suggested this move. I really like it queen c5 now. What is the idea? I'm posing a thread, I'm x-raying f2. What are we specifically 50 bucks off season, cornbread, so glad that it's helping you thank you so much for the 50., the bomb. Ladies and gentlemen, from cornbread, we're threatening queen takes d4 and knight f3. How did I see that? How does my brain spot that quickly? Well, the key sign guys when the bishop, when he's played g3 and the bishop is not fianchettoed. That's a warning sign in your med tactical metal, detector. Okay, when the move g3 has been played, but the bishop has left its fiancee square. The f3 square is often the source of tactics and I'll show you guys, after the game, a really beautiful idea in this line where that is applied. Okay, that's just a little thing to kind of remember. He actually is doing a good job thinking here, because he's in pretty big trouble. I think well, let's see what he does he's not lost, but he's in trouble. Well, if this should be three, then okay, ladies and gentlemen, queen takes d4 and the game is over okay, so yep now um. This is the fianchetto variation, so queen a5 is actually the move that I play as my main move. If we look in chess base uh, I will practice what I preach uh and that's the fundamental motivation here. If we look, if we do a search on this position in chess space and uh, let me go into the chess-based scene. If we go into the chess base scene and sorry guys, I keep doing this, but you guys can see that I've played it twice. I've actually played it more through different move orders, but I have a couple of games in the database in this line and that actually is my main line against the fiance. I won a nice game here against ivan key and I've played it for many years. The dude closed his account there we go so back to uh the game just wanted to show you so essentially the queen is deployed to a5. Now 95 attacks the pawn on c4. We go rookie 8 to deploy the rook now here's the line. If white goes bishop e3 here, then we go bishop e6 attacking the pawn trade, and in this position I have many times encountered, uh the move, a3 even anatoly karpov, all right guys. Moving on please moving on all right. This just is a thing, and it's only carpool into this. I've done this a million times black to play and find a beautiful idea, and the way that you see this idea is to spot the f3 score. Yes, he closes account guys, but moving on, please black, to play right queen b5, who sees it bingo battal for president knight takes e4 I'll gift. You a sub for that knight takes c4 queen takes e1 knight f3 check is a four brilliant tactic and knight takes e1 and, at the end of the day, black's going to be up in exchange, because if you take the knight I take this knight beautiful, isn't it that's actually part of the reason I like this movement, five believe it or not, even if white plays f4. This is one of the main lines. Black can still go, knight takes c4 and, if f takes e5 knight, g3 leads to absolute chaos. So, to show this again a3 our idea is to get the queen on a forkable square. Okay. That has to make sense for you guys to follow this. The point is that if the queen ends up on d2 or e1, we will be able to fork the queen. How do I know that this exists, because once again, the bishop is not on its fiance square, which means that the move g3 has now weakened the f3 square in order to get the queen in a forkable square, we open the gates. I call this like opening the gates. We distract the knight from c3, and we do that in order to now sacrifice our queen for the rook boom. Now the queen is on a forkable square. Our metal detectors go off because the king and the queen are unfortunate squares, knight, f3 check king has to move. We take the queen, but that's not the end of the story right now. If we count the pieces, we have two rooks and two pieces against one rook and three pieces so we're up in exchange. He would have had two pieces for a rook, but remember that his knight is now hanging due to our rook being on e6 all right. I've done this many times in blitz games, so remember four cribble squares and then distraction sacrifices yeah. So if after knight takes e4, he goes b4, then we can take on c3 and attack his queen. Okay, glad you guys enjoyed it now. The main line by the way in this position, for that reason, is to bring the king up so king g2 would be a better way to do what he did if he goes king g2, that would be that would have been a better idea. King h2 seems to defend against that. No no g3 is not bad, but but this move it doesn't actually solve the problem. It just makes it equally bad okay and that's why we played queen c5. So why couldn't he take my queen with his queen, because it's the same exact concept, knight f3 check and we win his queen back and we're up a piece. This came from the fiance variation of the king's indian, which is by the way, a very good variation. If you play it well, king h1 would be also good uh king each one would be the same idea, but this would leave the f2 pawn unattended, so the move queen c5 could still be considered here. That's why king g2 is good, because the king simultaneously defends all these coupons. Well, I think he thought I think that he thought he was somehow defending against uh certain ideas. He just didn't think this through. He didn't realize that the square was still undefended. He should have gone bishop e3 and at least given up a pawn, and at least he can continue to play. Although this is terrible, because white has also given up his fiance bishop well nanuka, queen b6 doesn't pose the secondary threat of attacking the pawn. So here white could even slide his king to g2, and we can't take that pawn don glover. Thank for the prem. What was the purpose of knight a4 if he hadn't played queen takes d4? Well, he was attacking my queen. You know he wanted my queen out of c5, which is understandable. I think you just failed to detect that this was a threat, all right, glad to hear that shikhar. Thank you all right, guys I'll give you guys one more encore game, I'm pretty high energy right now for some reason. I love doing this. This gives me a lot of energy, as does the support of everybody here. Another thank you for the 50 bucks from off season cornbread. We got 500 bits on top of it from fenvine gold, amazing, okay, no! I play knight bd7 as my full-time line. I love john. I love fed um, but you know I've played the king's indian. My whole life I still play it knight bd7, is in pretty good theoretical shape right now, yeah my book on positional chess is out of print I'll. Try to investigate that. Let's go I'm! I am high energy right now. Dude! This is these hours is what I live for. Well, thank you. Uh! You! It means so much for me to hear that and I'm honestly so happy that the people are enjoying this uh again, also great that people can come together over this. I'm very happy to be doing this. Thank you dog yotera, for the for the prime lovely. I can definitely be bribed with subs. That's for sure. I appreciate it. Man.
