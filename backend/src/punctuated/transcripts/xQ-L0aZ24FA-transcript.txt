[Music], this is ridiculous. 2335 the mombot shuffle that might be 2900 is this. Is this uh chest bra? Is this not chest bra? Okay? Hopefully this isn't just run like a smurf okay, so this is in english. This might be a monolith. No could somebody confirm are they like? Are they streaming so basically they're playing the anyways? We're gonna play this normally, so we have an english in a slightly weird, a slightly weird setup by white, we're just developing our pieces. Now the d4 square is weak. How do we exploit on the basis of this concept that we've discussed many times? What should be our next move? What should be our ultimate idea? What should be our ultimate idea? We want to get the knight to d4. How do we do that? Bingo, bishop g4 again, I must emphasize at this point. We don't want to rush giving up the bishop for the night. We want to have this option in our pocket so that when the time comes we play um, we play bishop takes f39. Now here he's got it5. So what should we do here? What comes to mind- and this is a great example of us- not rushing- not rushing with the move um with the move, knight, so yeah we can play knight t4 but um before we do that. Let's, let's get rid of this knight, it's annoying the hell out of me and and then let's play knight t4 to try to shatter his kingside font structure. Does that make sense? There is another perk of going knight takes d5. What is it? What do we? What idea becomes now possible in the future now that we've removed the knight from f6 and which one of these pieces should we actually end up taking? This is where people are gonna get go wrong. The idea is a five and because this idea exists, here's what we're gonna do. Normally. We would take the knight and keep our knight established on d4, but because I believe the idea of f5 is so strong, we're actually going to take the bishop and now we're going to castle and we're going to try to ram f5 through and we're going to try to apply as much pressure as possible on this knight. So this is a great example of where okay, so he's gone, g4, but he's stopped f5, but he's made massive weaknesses on the king side, which we're going to try to exploit in the long term and by the way, f5 is still an idea. We can sack a piece here, but before we do anything, we need to sort of break into the center uh. If we, if we let his pawns, remain in the center, we're gonna have a very hard time getting stuff done. So, let's go c6 to break him up a little bit and potentially we can play d5 and ultimately, if we can get this pawn off of e4, it's going to be easier for us to get a 5 in. So black is better here. I think that he did a good thing, our opponent, by playing fh3 g4. Otherwise it would have been crushing but a great position for us. Let's see if we can capital queen a2, okay, so that's weird and we're trying he's trying to discourage us from playing from playing f5. I get the ultimate idea, and how can we deal with this? Pin that's. Like sounds like a mom-bod shuffle move that bad shuffle. Well, we want to prepare d5 right. We want to prepare d5 and um yeah. Let's go king h8 first, let's unpin ourselves, let's, let's, let's un-pin ourselves, so that we don't have to worry about not being able to play f5. Okay, his attacks are pawn. Let's uh, let's defend it, rook c8 and get the rook into the game. Okay, nothing surprising! Here and now: let's prepare d5. How do we prepare e5, who can name a good move and here's what I want to hear? I want to hear a move that doesn't sacrifice the health of our position in preparing d5. So a move like rookie 8 would not be good because it would make it harder in the future to prepare five. We want the rook remaining on f8 in case we have the opportunity to play f5. So let's go queen e7. This also just connects the rook. Even if we don't go d5, we just connect the rooks, which is good and um. That's just independently good, regardless of what we do. So he stops d5 because he's going to take and take c8 uh, and we now have to find a way to somehow twist the knife in so let's actually go b5 yeah. So that's what I wanted to discourage. He goes a4 anyway. Let's take it, he takes with the queen and this actually might be a good time to start sacking everything with f5 because he's gotten his queen away from the king side, and I actually think that might be a really interesting. Try. Let's do it. Let's sacrifice a piece on f5. His king is like wide open, so I feel, like my two rooks in the queen, are going to constitute enough material to cause him tremendous difficulty in defense, okay, but he finds a really nice idea, so I could take on f3 and probably make a draw, but how else could we attack the knight? Oh, but he has a defense there? Oh, this is not good one sec. Let me think: hmm well, queen f6 and queen f sound the problem varus. He goes rook a8 the problem there and I missed this idea. This is, this is a problem I mean he found this very quickly. Yeah we're gonna have to go rook f3 here. We're gonna have to accept this end game. We're gonna have to accept this end game and uh. I don't know who's better. I think black is still better now he's attacking this. So let's go h5 create some look. Let's create some left. This rook is undefended alarm bells alarm bells alarm bells rook is undefended. King is weak. Four fork fork fork fork queen g5. The game is up, so we were still better there because his king was so wide open and the ultimate goal was to win before good game wins the rook and the sacrifice actually ended up working. Although it was close, he found a very nice defensive idea, um. No, it's not crazy. It's just that. He played too fast now the idea of this line. If we go bishop c5, what idea does white have? This is hilarious because we just talked about this in the previous game so who can apply the same idea to a different position? What do you look for when there's a knight on c6 and bishop on c5? Exactly this is actually the theoretical line, and black is it's not that black is in trouble, but white can get a better position here, which is why bishop b4 is considered to be the best move. So now everything we did here should be very obvious, knight d4- and this is where I made the judgment call I was like. Okay, we want to play f5 and uh. It would be. It would be less effective to play f5 if we, if we were to do this, because one of the one of the benefits of f5 is that we increase the pressure on the knight on f3 and it it's important to keep the knight there. It's important to keep the pin and we castle, because we want to recapture on f5 with the rook to enhance the pressure on the knight okay, so he chases us away, but he does it at the cost of creating weaknesses. Now we open up the center, we go king h8 to unpin ourselves, queen e7, to connect the rooks and prepare d5 b5 to stop a4. Now, why didn't I consider h5? So a lot of people wanted me at some point to play the move, h5 and the reason that I didn't play it is. I was afraid that it would create more harm than good right. The good that it would create is that it would soften up his king side. The harm that it would create is that it weakens my own king's side, and this is a great example of applying a concept I talked about earlier, which is: does he have enough pieces on the king side to exploit this weakness? And the answer is actually yes, because what idea does white have that he can now apply and he can start piling up on a weakness that has just been created by playing h5, hg, rook, h1, yeah and guess what that queen ain't too far away from h3 and then he's gonna, be threatening checkmate and attacking this pawn? Isn't such a big deal? Why can't just defend it by moving the knight out of the way? So so this was a judgment call I didn't do any calculation to determine this. It was just something I decided on the basis of these observations. That's all that I was thinking, and this is the critical moment now. I was worried that if I did not go f5, he would basically put pressure on the pawn and my initiative was going to evaporate. So something like this could be nasty and I just felt like my chances to get stuff done. The king side were rapidly evaporating. So that's why I thought. Okay, I need to do something right now and that's why I played f5 now part of the reason I thought this was a good time for f5 is that his queen is kind of out of the game it's out of the defense. So it's as good of a time as any, because his knight is his only piece guarding the king. This may be unsound, but I actually don't see exactly how white can defend easily if he goes rook c6, I'm just gonna go rook at fate right. I don't really care about him taking the pawn. What I want to do is pile up on the f file. There's some cool lines here, but I actually have to go in like three minutes. So I'm going to just talk about one more one, more moment which is like here. Why didn't I pile up on the knight even further and the reason was the move? Rook a8? What does this accomplish? Well, if we take the knight, then he cuts the legs off with brook, takes f8 and then queen takes f3 right. If we take the rook and obviously he forces the queen trait, actually he can even win the queen with rook c8, so um we kind of have to take now or never. What happens now is that we have a queen for two rooks uh four pawns. Each his pawns are super weak. He does have a passport. He should have gone rook b1 to protect it, but instead he went for this weird idea of shifting his king away. He just forgot about this fork. I think he didn't realize that his rooks were unprotected and when you have two rooks against the queen, one of the top pieces of advice I have is to keep your rooks defending each other. Queens are incredibly good at forcing forks when you keep your rooks defending each other. It reduces the possibility of forks. In addition, rook b1 would defend the b4 pawn and defend its neighbor on c1, so there would have been no forks. I think this is a draw. I basically probably would have had to force a perpetual black has ways to play for a win here, but I don't think that black is substantively better. He is not 2900, I don't know what people are talking about, so in any case guys. I hope this game makes sense, there's more to talk about, but I have to run. There should be six. This is all fury. Now we bring our bishop out. We try to get rid of this knight and now. Thank you both thing. We have that trap and this time he plays correctly the last time he played king h2 and he he blunted this trap. This is actually the best move. Now we have one more piece that we need to bring into the game. What should we do? What uh? What piece do we need to bring into the game which currently is not doing anything, and that's a very simple way of doing that? Of course, we need to bring the rook. We need to put it on the eight, because we've vacated that square by the other, rook yeah, so d would be a little less effective. It would just be sort of staring at the pawn and basically that pawn on e4 is what we're trying to target here right. We are kind of centering our forces, okay, that is a very strange move. Oh, that is actually not a strange move, he's so dc. He wants to play f4 and then he wants to play e5 and drive in that wedge into my position. Thank you, tyler mandel gifting to vitorash via trash. Let me think about this for a second okay. So what do we want to do here? How can we react to a move like this? Well, there's many things we can do. We don't actually have to take uh, but one thing that I want to show you guys is a positional peace sacrifice. We are going to take and here's what we're going to do, what we're going to do, let's see if he plays f4, he does we're going to sacrifice a piece and here's how we're going to do it we're going to move the knife back to d7. That should be logical and after e5, how are we going to? I assume he's going to play e5. How are we going to sacrifice a piece? What are we going to do to break open the position, we're going to do it for three pawns and we're going to do it because his king is a lot weaker than mine, so it should make sense to you guys, logically speaking, that opening up the position will allow us to attack okay. So we have three fonts for the piece, let's take stock for a second. What do we need to do? What we need to do is we need to basically get our pieces to the king side. First of all, let's take the rook and let's, let's really reduce that squeegen a5 catches, my eye because it's it's sort of it's uh, it's under under fire of the bishop. Can we put the queen on a square where it's at least making contact with something on the king's side? Well, we can put it on c7 yeah, it's making contact with the pawn, and I want to make it clear that the queen can be very strong on squares like these, because it's kind of hidden by my own pawns, so it can't be targeted by my opponent and I can combine it with a move like knight, h5 and start pressuring the pawn right, that's kind of what I'm trying to do here: no secret, okay, so he's driving his pawns in um, knight, h5. Maybe he's got bishop uh chasing it away. So let's actually go h5 and let's see if we can run r ram this pawn to h4, potentially okay. Now we need to defend the c5 pawn he's just attacked it uh. So I see he wants to probably go a5, that's probably what he wants to do and then what we're going to do? What we're going to do? Why did we play h5? What is the logical follow-up to that move? Okay, he doesn't do it. He actually is playing this game extremely well. Now, h4 here would be logical, but then he just played g4, so this knight on f6 can be improved. Where can we ultimately? Where can we guide this night? Where can we maneuver it? Well he's got an extra piece for three pawns, so we can maneuver it to e5, that's a central square. We can maneuver the knight to e5, and that would just that would chase the queen away and that would open up the bishop slightly for now. So let's see where he goes, we so I would say the position is unclear. I don't think we're worse. I don't think black is better he's been playing this tremendously so far, but this is where a lot of people go wrong like this is an unbalanced position. Any mistake could cost either side the game. Basically, okay, I don't think white is clearly better. I would respectfully disagree with that. I think it's unclear okay, so he goes here and uh. He pins. Our knights of the queen pins, are knights of the queen. Okay. What should we do here? Who can come up with an idea? So g5 is good. G5 distracts the queen yeah and he plays it super well in response, and now what we should do is let's bring our queen into d7 to support the rogue so that the knight can then move okay, we're going queen d7. It goes rook d1, that's! Oh! I actually missed that move yeah. We have to go to e7. Actually, that's what we should have done initially should have gone to e7 um. I I forgot that he had this move. Um yeah very sharp position. Nonetheless. So what is going to be our planning? Our plan is going to be twofold and we still want to target blacks, white's, king and sometimes in order to target your opponent's king. What you have to do is create stronghold squares for your piece. Okay, bishop p2, that's another insane! Very good move! Hmm yeah: this is getting very monga s, so let's go g4. Let's, let's just explode the king side, yeah he's playing very good, but we're going we're gonna sacrifice upon here in order to open up some avenues, okay, which he doesn't take. He instead piles up on the square he wants to checkmate us. Well, I've got to take. We can't let him check meta. So, let's take the bishop. Now, let's um! Well, let's activate our queen and let's put it on, let's put it on f6, potentially targeting the f3 square. That's what I'm doing um! So! Oh! This is another a really good move: one sec: okay, I'll go rook d and I'll attack his queen, queen h7, is not checkmate because we have this fade square. Sorry, I'm not like explaining as vocally as normally but okay. Okay, now we're gonna get the rook in we're. Gonna get the rook involved, we're gonna attack the bishop and now um, hmm he's not cheating relax. Now we're gonna go check. We're gonna force the queen tray and at the end of the queen trade. What are we gonna? Do we're gonna take the pawn and now what happens? We have all of these pawns and we need to push them because they are passed, but we need. We need to push them very strategically. What we first need to do is win this spot. If we win that pawn, then we will be able to start pushing the other pawns more easily, because this is like an obstruction. So let's capture it and then let's start pushing the c pawn and let's see who's first. Okay. First we're gonna bring our king out. Oh god, I just made a big mistake. I I allowed bishop f4, which I missed. Oh god, this is bad. For me, this might be my first loss. Actually, let me focus for a second guys. Let me just focus here and then I'll explain the stuff at the end, yeah this guy's playing the game, the game of his life, but he's totally legit 100 um, and it's not easy to bring me down. So I think I'll be fine, but we'll see. Okay, it's another amazing one by the way jesus. I can do this, though. Oh, my god, I'm going to the fork and he doesn't see it. Oh my god. Oh that was close. Okay, I'm going to the fork there. At some point. You are the fastest improving chess player. He says lmao, oh okay! I can't talk on this account. That was that was an incredible game of my opponent. He played like a gm. I have to give him full compliment. Um that was incredible, play okay. He says you're the fastest, improving chess player. I don't know if he knows this is a speedrun account. Okay, so there's a lot to explain guys. I'm sorry- and this is going to happen progressively and and I get it one sec. I think he was joking um. The accuracy is going to be very low because of the last part of the game. Thank you, pat adam, for the prime damn I'm I'm playing well guys 84.3 for him 92.5 for me um. So it's like high quality chess, but uh, but I there was clothes. There was a moment when I thought it was. It was losing okay. So if I had lost that game there would be no shame. Now, let's talk through some of the key moments here, because a lot went on and I want to explain some of the things that I didn't fully flesh out during the game. Okay, so this line, we repeated literally move for move and I've had this over the board. Now, basically, does anybody remember if white goes a3 and even anatoly carpal fell into this? What is the trap that I had illustrated previously? Does anybody remember? There is a very, very beautiful idea that black has here and the way you see this is the bishop is not on its fiance square. I've explained that previously, which means that the square on f3 is vulnerable to a potential fork, which means we have to distract the queen, but we can't distract the queen. Yet we first distract the knight. Now we distract the queen, then we fork the queen and the king. We take the queen and you might be like wait. A second now white gets two pieces for a rook white is fly, no he's not the knight is now hanging, and if the knight goes out to g5 and counter attacks the rook, then we can counter attack white's rook. At the end of the day, black's gonna be up a lot of material. So is the thing that happens after a3, it happens even after f4. You can take on e4 anyway, and if white takes the other knight, then you take on g3, and this is where my idea of a peace set came from. This is actually theory and black's got a very strong attack against the exposed king and this should make sense to people. Thank you, hello. Desk. Sorry, hell desk gifting to beer fish appreciate the support okay, so this makes sense to people. So king g2 is the best move according to theory, because uh he defends the f3 square. So this obviously will not work now uh. You will no longer have a fork on f3 you'll, simply blunder the knight there and and that's prophylaxis, so rook a8, makes sense, and now c5 is a move. I'm not familiar with according to the computer um, let's see what, according to the computer, this is a very good move and uh. This move might actually throw this line. So what what should I have done here? I should have actually moved my knight away first, probably so that c5 wouldn't be a thing. So the idea of c5, as you guys already understand, I think, is that okay he's attacking the pawn. So I can't ignore this. If I push d5 good night man, then we blunder the pawn right and by the way, if we, if we pin the queen to the knight he can take on f6, that is check. Okay, so no problem I take now he goes f4 he attacks tonight. This is like an undermining move right, because now he's got the possibility of going e5 because the pawn is no longer on d6. This is a very unpleasant situation because he attacks the knight. If I move my knight away, then queen takes d7 happens and he wins the other night uh. You might look at this for a second and say: well, no problem. You can go knight to d5, but guess what he takes twice and now look at the position very carefully. Bishop on g7 is locked out by white's poncho. That's why pawn chains can be so scary. Knight on d7 is hanging pawn on c5 is weak. Pawn on b7 is hanging. Do you guys see how bad this is? I mean it's just it's a nasty position. This is just visually a nasty position, and so I made the decision, the executive decision- and this is my biggest advice, perhaps from this game when things are going wrong like this, you want to find a way, as some chess authors call it to change the course of the game or change the trend of the game. Sometimes the game is moving in the wrong direction, and sometimes it might very well be the case that the computer actually recommends knight to fight- maybe that's marginally speaking, the best move, but it's a lot more uncomfortable for your opponent. If you do something like sack the night, because that basically changes the landscape, it forces him to adapt and guess what it's actually not that bad. So you want to make sure that this way that you're choosing of changing the course of the game is actually not terrible uh, and this isn't because we get three pawns for the piece and we weaken this king, but I think you guys see what I'm saying I am not a millionaire now, so we take twice, he goes. Bishop d2 we take the rogue and now queen c7 should make sense to people. We are moving the queen out of the range of the bishop, queen c7, okay, a4 a4 is a very good move uh. What is the purpose of this move? Wha wha like? What exactly is he accomplishing here, which is actually very instructive? I'm going to take a sip of the I put a lot of hot sauce in it too. A lot okay, 95 is the best move, nice [Music]. So what he's really doing? No he's not prevented preparing the rook lifts, because the rook lift is pretty it's pretty far-fetched, because he's got a knight here. What he's basically doing is uh preventing my pawns from pushing forward he's, reducing the mobility of my pawns and he's doing that by preventing d5 and eventually he can push his pawn to a5 and what that does is a very interesting situation. I played h5 to potentially go to h4 and create weaknesses on his king um. Let's say that he would have played a5. The problem here is, if I ever push the b pawn, what does white do in this situation and what does white accomplish as a consequence of doing that, and this is a situation you guys should sort of file into your mental rolodex, so he takes on poisson and what he gains is the eighth file and he can use the save file you can put his queen there. He reduces my upon majority and and he can infiltrate down that a file if he wants to. So it's a very hard situation to get out of if you're black, but he decided to go bishop f2, um, okay, so I went b6 to defend the pawn. Now we got our knight to a slightly better square, and here he did. He he played extremely well so queen f4 is nice g5 for a second, I thought it wins the piece, but it doesn't helldesk. Thank you for the gift to dark, dota 94, because he's got queen e4 and if we unpack the situation, the knight cannot move because the rook is pinned. So I defended the rook so that the knight can move, but he goes rook d1 and he attacks my queen forcing him to move again. Okay, so I move it and he goes bishop back to e2 very nice move. How does he find this move? The moment I played g5. My opponent was like. Ah this pawn on h5 is not weak, and I tell you guys to do this all the time when a pawn is pushed on a particularly important side of the board. You should understand for like 5-10 seconds, okay, what weaknesses are created so the pawn in h5 is now weak. It's not defensible by any other pawns, and so he drops his bishop back to attack it, and remember that I have sacrificed a piece. So I can't just willy-nilly give up pawns, which I kind of did because I had to so if he takes on g5. I just take his bishop. Remember that the queen is defending the bishop, so if he takes on g5, I simply take the bishop, so that is a very classy move which hopefully everybody understands by now, I played g4 the reason that I did that was. I figured if I'm not already giving up a pawn and there's literally no way to defend this one I figured I might. I might as well induce some marginal weaknesses in his position, so I thought I might as well get rid of his h1 so that his king becomes a little bit weaker and I think there was no reason for my opponent not to take the pawn. I think he bought my bluff, which was also part of why I played it. I this is just like bluff, because black is nothing black is much much worse. Slash lost and bishop v2 was a crusher, so bishop back to d3 gives me a bit of a respite, because now I take on d3. I still have three pawns for the piece I can centralize my queen and stuff, and this is where I I was like very much on the nice. So a lot of people would see this move and think, ah you know this is just crushing, but the reality is the bishop on g7, one of the perks of putting it there is h7 is not going to be checkmate. You're just going to be able to slide your king to f8 and mayonnaise master gifting to raffle is a lot. Thank you guys. So does that make sense? That's why I allowed myself this move. He does give a check, but then he quickly realized that I actually have a bigger threat than he just played on the board, which is queen f3 check. That's why he brings his queen back. I go rook t2. This is where I made a very, very important decision. The decision I made here is to trade queens yeah 24. I hallucinated that he has checkmate for some reason. I forgot that his rook is not on e1. I thought this was mate, but obviously it's not so. I saw this move and forgot about it. This would have been super strong. Instead, I basically give up a pawn in order to get into an end game. Why did I do that? So the reason I did that is in the same speed: it's a move in the same spirit as knight takes e5 uh. He is ready. He is geared up to attack and by trading queens, I'm forcing him to adapt to a new type of situation and also objectively, look at my pawn mass. I judged that these pawns would essentially be unstoppable. I was kind of wrong because he played this extremely well. What he basically does is he gives up the pawn, but he goes for peace activity. Look at how he activates his king. He brings his rook to an open file very instructive play bishop to an open, diagonal king out, king out to f5 I mean now, I'm in huge trouble. I had to find this really important move, rook a3. The idea of this move is if he takes on f6 what happens? Who can tell me what the idea of three is yeah? No one understands the algorithm. I think most of my viewers are a lot of. My viewers are subs now, so that's a good thing, so yeah rook f3 at the end. So basically I'm repositioning my rook to god have three win the night. That is a defensive idea that I found amen and basically, what happens now is we get this pawn race? The pawn race comes down to some tactics, and here I could have forced to draw, but I found this idea. It takes a bit should be two amazing position, I'm down a rook, but he can't stop my promotion. So he tries to distract me by giving me this check, and now I go king f8, I'm not sure if this actually works, I'm gonna check the computer. Here, oh, oh, my god, white is winning so I could have made a draw. I could have made a draw with king g7 white is winning with a beautiful idea very hard to find yeah. So king h6 now the reason. Okay, I think we we know your answer is in cosa. I think the reason this is hard to see is because we allow promotion and even though black is now up to pawns- and it seems like we're out of the woods white goes- king h7, that's the whole idea and g7 is unstoppable. This idea is literally unstoppable. White makes a queen wait what's the game, so I mean for finding this in time pressure. It is so hard, particularly because you have to refrain from giving a discovered check, which is incredible, but what I did I maneuvered my king to ga and by the narrowest of threads. I'm able to avoid checkmate and white is already losing here, because if he gives a check on f6, the bishop is multitasking, because it's a it's supporting the promotion square but b it's defending this square. Otherwise it would be checkmate, obviously all right. So at this point I promote the queen. This is still very tricky, but I made a queen or they actually blundered a fork. That's kind of funny. I didn't expect king c8, I expected king c7, then I thought I was going to give a check, but he went king c8 and he could have made a draw here with 97. So I got very lucky here. This could have easily been my first loss. It could have also easily been my first try and we got another gifted sub from helldesk to ships at dark, but hopefully the explanations make sense. This was a pretty complex game, um and- and my opponent played extremely well so big big kudos to vanya hargreaves. The speed run is officially over my head, but okay, I want to push back on that perceptus. What like what part exactly, if I may ask uh was like you feel like over your head, like what explanation do you feel like was, or was it sort of a general thing, but was, if there's something specific, that I can clarify or explain better um? I I want to do that and I mean it. I mean. I know that this game is complicated. I'm under no illusions, um and I don't expect beginners to follow everything. I do and say right, but that's a limited mentality right because after the game, I I explain everything very slowly. I I'm not expecting people to follow everything during the game, but after the game, I'm really trying to break things down in a way that most people will understand. Okay, all of it was over my head, uh, even the explanations: okay, yeah. There is a ton to unpack I and and remember, to ask specific questions like um, I'm trying to like group things into concepts right so, for example, in the opening right uh the way that I think you guys should think about this. If you're rated 700 800, how should you try to understand these games? You should try to categorize the moves, rather than trying to understand each move on a granular level. You should try to yeah so changing the course of the game. So you should try to understand what a move accomplishes on a broad level, for example, um, for example, uh a move like 95. Okay, like what does this move accomplish like what? What is the purpose of this move? And what is the purpose of this move, because all of these moves belong to the same exact category, this move, and even this move. All of these moves have been played with the same intention in mind: it's not outpost! Why it's? It's all about the meta patterns, um, activating your pieces, you're, simply completing your development in a way that is geared toward exploiting the main weaknesses in your opponent's position, because white has two main weaknesses here. It is his central pawns right. His central pawns are the things that we want to attack here. So not only do we position our pieces on better squares and sort of develop visually, we put them on squares where they are better at applying pressure at white's main weaknesses. Okay, so then the move knight takes e5 right. How do we categorize this move? This is a changing the course of the game move. So the last couple moves white has been putting pressure on me and um. You know I have to move my knight, I mean anybody should see that my knight is being attacked so knight e5. I explained I explained why this is bad and the reason this is bad is because of several factors that coalesce together and make black's position very nasty. The first thing is, there is simply a lot of hanging here right and you guys should just see that right. The knight is hanging knight takes a queen, takes b7, and if the knight moves, then, then you give up this pawn because the bishop defends the queen, then there is a set of more positional factors, so non-concrete observations, nothing that relates to a specific thing. That is hanging, but rather, if you look at this bishop guys, if you look at this bishop, what can you tell me about this bishop? Is it a good bishop? Is it a bad bishop and why so I'll explain that is where so, queen c7 would protect everything in the immediacy, but the bishop is obviously bad right. It's terrible it's blocked by the pawns and that's why I mention the pawn shape. Pawn chains are really good at blocking off certain pieces. Now, queen c7 defends against the immediate threats but, as I have explained, black's position isn't bad only because there's hanging stuff, it's bad because there's a lot of long-term weaknesses, and so one thing that white can do here is go rook a to d1 attacking the knight he can also go. What is another way of attacking the knight here? What is the other way here of attacking the knight yeah? The bishop is, is just not doing anything it's staring at the pawn, so there's also bishop b5 right and this sets a pin. So that is where intuition comes in. When I look at this position, I don't break everything down to these separate assumptions. That's what I do as a teacher to help people understand, and I don't expect people to do that. But when you do this consistently over the course of many years with many positions, you train your brain to immediately understand the important factors in the position. So I see this like quickly as okay. The bishop is bad stuff's hanging queen is super active and these factors they come together to make the evaluation what it is so well. Rookie, the rook on e1 is sort of supervising that e pawn, so this rook is not doing anything. This rook is closer to the center. You want both rooks closer to the center and um, and that's basically the logic um. The other thing I want to make clear here is that you know, even at this level, things really can be broken down to these similarities. The game has become more complicated and what does complicated mean in the context of chess? What it really means, in my opinion, is there's more imbalances right. The positions are less symmetrical, there's more positions where there's a ton to unpack like there is here and a lot more hinges on calculation like we both see this line, so I decide to sacrifice a piece in order to take the game into a different direction. That's what it means to change the course of the game. Let me give you a drastic example, which I think will help people understand the concept of changing the course of the game. This is a very famous game and one of the craziest examples I have ever seen of changing the course of the game that occurred at a grand master level prepare to get shocked right here and by the way I really appreciate them. People are honest with me about, like you know certain things they don't understand. I I'm truly passionate about helping people understand this stuff. So let me let me set up my chest spaces, so this is actually going to blow your mind and it'll. Take it'll. Take me some explaining to explain to you guys why the position is lost, but I will I will manage to do that. I think so. That's what you guys have decided to play is a game that is uh very tricky. Okay, so actually, oh, so I've been setting this up all along yeah. So basically you guys can see that this is a game between yaburback and spassky, boris spassky. Of course, world champion was 19 when this game was played and in this position average is the oldest living g up currently, in this position, white is completely winning white is completely winning. Why is that? Why? Why is white computer? Let's flip the board, there's several things to notice here. The first is look at this piece of crap right here on g7. Look at this piece of crap on g7. It's literally doing absolutely nothing, but that's not even the most important thing. The fact that black is super passive, look at the h file very very carefully. You guys see that there is a pawn on h5 this pawn on h5 could capture the pawn on g6 that opens up the h file and white can use this hval to deliver checkmate very very quickly. So, let's, let's drop a quick example. Let's say black develops this knight. Okay, this should be reasonable to everybody. We're just developing our knight, okay white takes on g6. We open the h file. How does white attack this pawn? What is a specific way in which white could attack the g6 pawn? There's many plans here that win the game, but I want to give you guys a specific example of how quickly things could go bad, so this attacks the pawn. It also opens up a little avenue for the queen to come out to g4. So let's say black defends it with his king black says: I'm getting the king out of there and simultaneously I'm going to defend the pawn now white has a small small tactic that leads basically either to checkmate or to total devastation. Find it yeah. Knight, g6, is correct, sacrifice checkmate! That's it! Now black can defend this slightly more resiliently, but he's not going to be able to stop what from piling up on the h file and ultimately delivering some sort of a checkmate down the hvac. That again, I hope is clear to everybody. So spassky was like man, I am completely lost, I'm completely lost and I have to do something right now to radically uh change the way that the game is going and he plays a move. That's one of my favorite moves ever played, because this move is so absurd. It is completely losing. It doesn't objectively, do anything to save the position, but it shocks the opponent so much that avermax started to play absolutely horribly as a consequence of this move. Now you guys are coming close when you say: knight takes d5, but knight takes d5. Actually just make thing around this guy's, a gm he's not going to like flip out at knight takes d5. Actually, we've had one one guy see it, which is blind score. Yeah, knight, c6 rn's thing for the prime knight c6, so the knight is going to d4 um, so white has to take it literally just giving up a full piece for minimal compensation minimal. There is, however, some compensation, so what has been created as a result? First of all, white center has been removed. Now, if we look at this knight for a second, where can this knight travel yeah? So a lot of you guys are noticing that the knight can go out to d4. The other thing is uh black. Has this big pawn center and eventually he could break through with d5? Now these are things that do not compensate in the least for the fact that white has an extra piece. White still has that h-file attack, and this is completely losing. But if you watch what happens, spassky actually starts to capitalize. On these things, so aberbach actually does the stuff that I mentioned and spassky guess what he gets his knight to d4, okay and somewhere around this point, everybody started to play very badly. Now he goes queen f7 and all of a sudden, it turns out that white's h-file attack doesn't lead to clear checkmate in the meantime. Spassky actually begins to attack and and ever back as winnie spassky takes another pawn, and then things get really chaotic things get complicated. Avromac was winning with this move, but um. This is not that easy to see so there's actually a really sexy idea here that this involves so rookie shape was winning. Why? Because after bishop takes h8 rook takes a straight, this is a pin. King has to describe skewer king has to move. Rook takes v8, it actually looks like black is a winning move. It actually looks like black is winning here, because you can take the knight you'll still be down a piece, but black can do what black can play. No knight c2 is not checkmate because of king d2, but you're thinking in the right direction. Now this move would be checkmate, but there's a queen on g4 that would take e2. So what you can do is play f3, intercepting the queen's control over the square, and the point is: if white goes king d2 and tries to evacuate, we give a check and we give the checkmate using the knight on d2 white. Has a defense white. Is an amazing defensive idea here, I'll, let you guys think about it. So I can finish off that phone, but white actually can defend against this checkmate, and this is really tricky. So I'm not really expecting everybody to see it, and this is something I would maybe miss. It's a two-move idea, but you go night at four sacking the night and after e takes f4, so bishop takes d4 is, is not necessarily the best you can play queen takes f3 immediately and because of the pin the knight cannot move. This would actually be checkmate, were it not for the pin e2 is protected and on the next move you can eliminate the knight and whites or blacks attack fizzles out. The knight of four is a very pretty move that exploits this latent pin here right. You don't think this matters, but it actually does so quite quite a beautiful defensive idea and um. That's kind of the point of this whole thing. So basically, my voice just got there, but averbach goes bishop, d4 and, and eventually they get into this end. Game and and spassky starts pushing his pawns and look at look at how many pawns black has in the center. So basically the game goes on and on and on and the game actually ends in a draw. The hilarious thing is spassky was actually winning at some point. Things get chaotic spassky was actually winning at some point and you can see how much chaos there is on the board. He wins in exchange that aberbach blunders and then aberbach is the one who has to save the draw which he does and probably, but basically that was one of the most famous applications of this concept um, and I hope that it makes a little bit more sense now like when you're completely losing, and you feel like your opponent- is just going to steamroll you, you got to find a move that has some sort of shock value but, more importantly, it has to be a move that could plausibly turn the game around blundering. Your queen has shock value, but it's just going to accelerate your defeat. That's where people misunderstand this, I'm not suggesting anybody give up your rook for free or give up your queen for free. You got to find a move that actually does have an idea. As this move did right, you actually gained something. The bow test. Gambit is not going to help. It has to be something that creates actual chances. At the same time, it can be something which whose psychological value does outweigh its objective. What about a rookie, jacob 99? Thank you for the pride okay back to the speedrun.
