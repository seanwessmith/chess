We um we're at 12 19., let's see if we can get to 1 300 today, let's see if we can get to 1300 today, uh now I normally have a notebook at hand, but we're just gonna. Do it live here? We'll do it live we'll? Do it live? Do it live? I can I'll write it and we'll do it live all right. Let's go! Let's get this show on the road guys. Let's get this show on the road. Okay, so we're playing at 1200 all right, we'll play the sicilian we we have and we'll play the accelerated dragon. Let's see if he does the open sitzillion. Maybe he goes bishop's? Okay, he does do the open, sicilian and uh. We played this once before the accelerated dragon, where you get your bishop out very very quickly, now he's gone, c3, sort of xqc style and that's not a great move because it takes away the natural developing square from his knight. So now, after knight f6, we attacked his pawn and he's got to make this very awkward, ooh. Okay, so he's already pushing a bunch of pawns and weakening his position. That's a that's a clue that we need to open up the center asap. So in what way are we going to open the center up and and first we're going to castle and we're going to open it up after we castle? So the move is going to be d5, but let's not rush with that move. Let's castle. First he's probably going to develop his bishop. My guess is perhaps the c4 and that's actually just going to add more fuel to the fire, because d5 is going to come with tempo. This move is so strong that he's disconnected okay, bishop b2, and now we go d5. Now we don't need to actually prevent him from castling. That's not necessarily the entire point, we're just trying to expose the weaknesses in his position and even if he castles uh, he doesn't necessarily well whoa bobby boucher with ten tempted. Thank you and a great game. Uh amazing stuff. The party continues. Thank you bobby for the 10 gifted to the community. That is an adoption of subs, indeed, okay. So what do we do in this position? How do we continue accumulating the pressure? Perhaps you know just generally applying more pressure on his position. There's a great square for this knight, and that is the f4 square. Yes, knight f4 is very typical. Um awesome well welcome, okay, so this at this level already. This is where tactics come into play right. This is when you need when you need to start looking at tactics. When I look at this position. What do I see? I see the fact that knight takes e2 uh, just sort of exists, so there is a tactic at the end of which you play knight takes e2 and knight takes e2 is actually a fork. Can anybody find this tactic in its entirety? Can anybody find this tactic in its entirety and it's and it's a pretty difficult tactic, so you just take everything on g4 and there's any touchscreen on g4 there's an etyptian on d4, and actually we take on deport with the queen, which is actually a very typical type of tactic. I don't even know what to call it. I guess it's removing the defender, but we basically force white's queen onto a forkable square. Then we take the bishop and then we recapture the queen and weapon piece. So how you see this well, that's why we put knights on acts of squares when you have a knight like that on f4, okay, he's gone king h1, so he's chosen simply not to recapture the piece we're just going to move the bishop back and we're going to be up a full bishop with this knight also making call okay, so he's gone into the end game. But this is completely lost, so it's it seems complex, but the reality is, if you understand the underlying idea, uh, which is the fact that his position is already almost crumbling, then you should already be looking for tactics to start, okay and and if you solve. This, is where just like solving tactics helps because if you just solve a lot of tactics- and here we're just going to infiltrate to the to the second rank and we're going to start the process of completing this game but uh, this is not terribly difficult to sense. This I I don't want to make it seem like this is some sort of black magic. The fact is that the knight is on f4, the bishop money, 2 is poorly defended, and so all of these factors put together are responsible for there being a tactic, I'll I'll, fully explain this uh after the game. Okay, so he's gone g3 and the knee-jerk reaction for most people would be to move this knight right he's attacking this knight. We have to move it uh, but but the reality is we do not have to move the sign. How do I know that? Well, look. Take a look at black white's king for a second does the king have any squares nope g1 is covered by our bishop. G2 is covered by a rook, so we should already be looking for mating patterns uh, regardless of the fact that the knight is hanging and we find one in the form of bishop h3, aiming for the g2 square, which is going to be checkmate and the game is over. So the sicilian is a great weapon at this level. If you know how to play it, because people are kind of aimlessly floundering around and you can see how potent it is once we open up the center, we get the knight to f4 and we win the game very very quickly. Now before we start the next game, I'm just going to explain what was the point. If white captures on d4, we play queen takes d4, and this is a very nice move. We sacked the queen temporarily, but now the knight recaptures, the bishop and it's a fork. If the king moves away, which he should have done, then we actually also take on b2 and it's another fork, and we see this chain reaction, often like when the position opens up like this everything starts collapsing. So I highly highly recommend the accelerated dragon as a gateway into the situ. If you want to learn the sicilian but you're worried about tons of theory and getting checkmated, the accelerated dragon is very approachable. There isn't a forbidding amount of theory and the ideas are relatively easy to understand and there's a lot of traps. So it's got it all and it's actually not an objectively bad opening right. It's it's magnus plays it and it's it's quite difficult for white to prove an advantage, even at a grand master level. So well, when did I decide to open up the center well when he played f3, because the moment he played f3 is the moment that he weakened his bishop. It's the moment he weakened his king side and when that kind of move is played, it alerts in me the desire to open up the center, which I could have done immediately, but I decided first to castle just to be a little bit on the safe side. It's not like he's gonna. Stop me from playing d5 um. How did this escalate well because he's just not developing he's just weakening his position? Okay, so, as I said guys, I play three three games at a time and after those games are concluded, I go through each one in in greater detail. So let's play the next two games and then I will answer everybody's questions. I promise all right: let's go e4 and um. Okay, so he's playing the modern. The modern is uh an opening where black immediately clean keto is a suspicion. This is an opening that you might see me playing in blitz. I don't recommend it to beginners, because it requires a very deep understanding of well how to play against the center and you basically yield control over the center. Now. How should we play here if we are white? What do we do here and there's a very brute force approach which I would recommend which really tests uh your opponent's understanding black is just pushing out a lot of his pawns, he's creating a lot of targets and we can actually just start attacking one of these targets. Well, we don't want to play f4 uh, but that's the right idea right. We want to push up onto the h file, we're actually going to play h4 uh, you guys, I'm sure, have well and he immediately responds with h5, but what square does h5 actually weaken? Where can we actually put one of our pieces now and this creates a thread and it essentially causes a chain reaction. I mean h5 is already a mistake right, so we can bring our bishop to g5 uh. He goes bishop f6 uh and at this point I've already talked about positional concepts quite a bit, and here I'll reinforce them by playing bishop f6 he's offering us a bishop trade which I will accept and by offering us a bishop trade look at his dark squares. They have been tremendously weakened by this move, g6 and e6. How do we cement our control over those dark squares? Yes, beware is correct. We go e5 and now the f6 square is firmly under our control. But let's not forget that we also need to develop our pieces uh. We need to combine control over the dark squares with piece development, so so, let's first take a moment to complete our development. Okay, let's first complete our development, and I always remind people of how important that is now we're just going to go to nf3 and later we're going to try to get this knight over f6. Before we do that, we can actually make another development move here, uh with tempo and it's a great move. It prepares castles long now and it attacks one of our opponent's pieces, and that is the move queen to d2 and later on. You can imagine that the queen can perhaps maneuver to g5 and uh start attacking. Perhaps it's the knight ants ends up on f6, and now we just uh maneuver the knight over to this beautiful fortress on f6, where it's protected. Sorry outpost on f6, where it's protected by the pawn on e5 pawn on e5 is protected by the pawn on d4, and that is the power of a pawn chain right. It's very hard to break that up now. How are we going to actually continue? Well, knight, d7? That's a very, very good move for our opponents, uh, which I will be honest with you guys. I I underestimated this move uh, but but part of chess mastery is the ability to react to unforeseen developments right. I didn't entirely appreciate this move myself and one of the things that players really really struggles, uh really really struggle with, is the ability to admit their mistakes, the ability to just say you know what I you know. I played this move and uh. The move wasn't great, so guess what I'm just gonna bring bring the knight back to e4, okay time to retreat, uh and and uh my long time coach for many years, gregory kaidanov. He called this saying sorry right. Sometimes you just have to say sorry, that's a lot better than stubbornly continuing with your plan. So now we're going to castle and this queen from d2 needs to be brought to a more active square in order to act as the glue that'll keep the e5 bond better defended. Now we're just starting to accumulate pieces on the king side in preparation for an attack. Our opponent is trading bishops. Fine, I don't care, let's trade, and how are we going to go about continuing the attack in order to continue the attack? We need more pieces. We have a very typical attacking mechanism that can be used to bring another piece into the attack. What am I talking about? It's the rl. Those are the initials of the strategy that we can put on the board right now we can double. We can also rook lift uh. Both options involve our rooks. I really actually like the double idea of doubling rooks on the d file. Why are we doubling rooks on the default? Well, we're doubling rooks in order to attack the knight. Why are we trying to attack the knight? Because we want to get our knight to f6, just because we retreated that knight from f6 earlier doesn't mean that that's not a good idea in the long term uh. We want to put that knight on f6, that's going to be huge for our attack and in order to do that, we'll have to get that knight out of d7 uh. We could have sacked on d7, but I didn't see a need to do that. I think that would have been a little bit too drastic and now he's got to move his knight. I don't see a way for him to defend it. If he goes rick d8 we're going to have insurmountable pressure on the d file, we're going to be able to explode so he's gone, rook d8, typical mistake. What he doesn't realize is this rook on d8 is in our cross hairs. If his knight moves from d7 will be able to capture on d8, so now a very simple tactic wins the game. We go knight f6. If he takes on f6, we don't immediately grab the rook on d8. What do we do? First? If he takes on f6? How do we win the maximal amount of material? We actually play e takes f6 check, intermediate move intermediate and that's how you find intermediate moves right. You don't rush into just assuming that you take the first material that presents itself. You just take a second and ask yourself all right. Wait. How can I get the most out of the position? Okay, I can take the knight with check first and then I can take the rock and okay. So now it is time to the victor belong the spoils we take on d7. Not only have we won a piece, but our rook is now at a prime attacking location uh in order to bring the most benefit out of that location. We need to involve one more piece into the attack and those dark squares. Okay, queen before, let's be on alert, he's made a tricky move. Gotta attend to this, but just because it's the end game doesn't mean that the attack is evaporated. What move am I talking about? How do we bring that final piece into the attack with devastating effect, knight to g5 is correct, we're to take on f7 or take on e6, because the pawn is pinned and essentially the game is over. We are also a piece, so, let's just take all of the pieces. Yeah intermezzo is the sort of italian way to say intermediate move uh, so here there's many ways to win um. One piece of general advice that I have to share with you guys in such endgames is uh the common phrase that is used here in endgames in general, which is do not hurry. Uh, that's sort of a russian kind of maxim, that's that's told often to beginners and to kids, do not hurry in the end game, and that means several things. First of all, there's a tendency to play fast in the end game and second, while there's a tendency to play fast on the board right. There's a tendency to just try to rush your ideas, but sometimes you just want to improve your position, and that is the most effective way of um. You know of of converting an advantage. Quite often, let's play the last game, and then we will analyze. Okay, so we're playing a russian serota. That means orphan orphan, nine, okay, c5, um, c4, okay, so he's playing the smith mora, probably nope he plays queen takes d4, not a good move. Why not? What do we do? I know knight c6 yeah. This is weird um he's just letting us develop a tempo, and now we develop again and his queen is going to get in the way now he's playing sort of the center game against the sicilian. But that's not how this works. Now. You guys already know from so many games that I played. How do we deal with this kind of opening play? What move do we make and what is the strategy behind that move, and this is not the only way of playing? We can also fianchetto our bishop. That would be a great idea, but let's open up the center with d5 right, our first impulse in situations when we are anticipating a big lead in development is to open up the center. But to do so strategically right, you don't want to sacrifice like eight pieces to open up the center. You want to do so in a manner conducive to your further development. Okay, he's gone bishop d3 um, and we have several approaches here. We can. We can take and take out of his bishop, and that would be fine but uh. Let's, let's uh control some more of the center. Let's go e5 and open up our bishop and control some more of the center. We want him to be the one to take on d5. Why uh, because then we capture back with a knight and our knight is nicely placed in the center okay. Let's continue our development in a very uh non-intrusive way, and I've made this point to you guys before not every development move has to be equivalent to finding a coronavirus vaccine like it's fine, to develop in a simple, straightforward manner, and that is what I'm going to do with the bishop b7, but isn't the bishop passive here like? Why are you not putting it on before? Well, because we're just trying to develop and castle right, you don't always have to look for the most aggressive square for every one of your pieces. Uh then you're just going to you, know, you're going to lose on time on move five uh and when, when you talk about development, the role of development is to put your pieces on decent serviceable squares. Not to just like you know, I don't know, go crazy and checkmate. Every opponent on move five queen d2 is is a very weird move. I assume that's a mouse slip. He blunders a fork, the knight defends the pawn, and so he loses a piece, and that was the consequences of him moving his screen around in the opening. Okay, don't over return! That's right: I am not going to flag uh, don't worry, I I am a professional okay, um rumor has it. I've played a couple bullet games in my life, okay, so he has to decide which bc gives up. Um he's busted either way, and I don't think he's very happy right now by the time he's expending here. Okay, let me let me um change the title so uh. If I were him and I had to actually make something out of this okay, I would not do this because now, in addition to giving up a piece he's up and look at this, he's ruining his pawn structure and so in terms of we've talked about two methods of converting uh material advantages. One is to trade as much as possible. The other is attacking. What does his move tell us about which of these plants we should choose? Do you guys think we should now trade all the pieces, or should we close the avenue of negotiation between the queens and start attacking? Clearly, we should attack right, and this isn't rocket. Science he's just weakened his king, like this. The way that we would attack is by playing knight to d4 knight td4 closes the avenue of negotiation between the queens and we are actually kind of forking the pawn on f3 forking a fork, as I like to say, and we're attacking the bishop forcing the bishop back to e2, then we're going to take on h3 and mate is going to come within three four moves, because his king is wide open. Okay, he's giving up his queen instead, both has gambit and the game is over. So that was relatively straightforward. That decision logic uh is, I think, relatively instructive. We kind of detect the clues in the position he resigns and that was very straightforward. Okay, let's very quickly go through the uh, the three games we played now in this game. Uh there was a question about going e5 and the movie e5 in general. I see a lot of players falling for a temptation like this, but when you look at this move positionally, what is the drawback? What is the drawback of the move? E5 if you look at it from a positional standpoint, the bishop now aims at a wall. I personally, and it's not just a personal thing: you've got to be very careful about the situation because I don't know when you're going to get the spawn out of e5 and it's a pretty big deal when you block your bishop like this, so you better have a pretty damn good reason to do that and when there is an equivalent way of opening the center to make this kind of positional concession is a little bit dubious. Now, it's still not a very bad move because you could follow up with d5 and essentially later on. You can move that pawn out of e5 to e4, but I would say be very careful about what I call static again. I'm saying what I call, but I didn't invent any of these terms: um trust, educators, far greater than me, invented them, but basically the concept of static weaknesses, right weaknesses that cannot be corrected, uh very easily and might be essentially permanent. That is what you need to be very careful about, and that involves and includes things like making a piece very bad by having it stare at a wall or weakening a particular square for a long period of time. Those things uh should be done very very carefully, and you should only do them if you have a very, very good reason to do that. Okay, the movie e6, would be similarly dubious because it would weaken this d6 square and I've shown you guys an example of why you want to be very careful in the sicilian specifically about combining the moves. G6 and e6, and part of the reason is that you leave unattended this complex of dark squares, okay and he can slam that outpost into d6 right off the bat. If you guys want I've, and I've actually showed you guys uh a couple of illustrative examples of what happens when a knight lands on d6 like this, it can paralyze black's entire queen side uh for the rest of the game. I mean it's particularly if a pawn were to then advance and support that knight. So let me actually give you a very straightforward example of of such a game from my own career and I well there's a couple of there's a couple of games. I could show you a couple of positive experiences and negative experiences, but here is a good illustration. So this is one of my. This is actually one of my best games. Uh I was in I am when this game was played. I I was white okay. This was after I got my third gm norm uh, but I was still like and I am and I was playing a pretty strong gm as you guys can see. Thank you peanut butter, jello time and look what happens. I sacrifice a pawn as usual um and I managed to get a knight to d6, and this is the sicilian look at this knight very very carefully. It basically remains there for most of the game completely completely paralyzing black's position, and what I'm trying to do here is I'm accumulating the pressure. E5 here comes the pawn that guards the knight it's chess-based, guys. It's not microsoft, word it's just modeled. After microsoft and now a very nice move, knight f5, the knight basically leaves d6, but only to sacrifice itself. What is the idea after g takes f5? What is the idea? And it's a very simple move? It's not really a sacrifice, because he can't really take bishop h6 and his checkmate, because this bishop blocks the f pawn. So he can't set up this link between the queen and the bishop uh, and so he was forced to go up 88 and now I simply collect the pawns. But the rest is very simple. Bishop f6 and I hunted his king down to checkmate g4. He resigned here because after king f4 uh, it's just checkmate so yeah uh. This was a pretty good game and you can see that it all started from me establishing that knight on d6 the game was very one-sided. He just didn't manage to do anything okay, so that was a positive experience, but I also had a negative experience of weakening that particular square uh, and here you guys go fast or rewind, I suppose, to 2005.. I am 1800 and I'm playing against this guy and guess what I do. G6 and e6 boom boom yeah bing bang boom, okay, one after the other, and he wins a rook okay. So this game was a cautionary tale to me about not playing g6 and e6 together in the sicilian, because it leaves these squares unattended. I won the game in the end, I managed to swindle him, but well and by the way, those of you who are how did you? I have a database of my games from you know as early as 2004 onwards, and I just searched it um. I remember, roughly speaking the opening from all of my games, so I can sort of track them down quickly, uh, particularly the memorable games. So in any case I won't have, I won't show the entire game. I managed to win his night back and I made things interesting and then I want his rook back and well. I um I played a nice game to swindle him, but the fact remains. This was my cautionary tale. During the reset of the server I will uh. I will show some more of my early games. Okay, so in any case, that's the rationale behind d5, long story short and then, of course, we find this tactic, and the rest is very simple in this other game. The move, h4 is what I want to explain. I want people to understand the logic behind the move. H4. What is the logic behind this move? Um, well idle strategist. Uh chess base is not a competitor for chess.com, so I'm allowed to use it uh. I wouldn't use leaches. For example. It's just base is not a playing server, it's just a server to analyze uh, although it does have a playing server as well uh. So this move has two well, it has one main goal and then it has a positive byproduct. The positive byproduct of this move is that it controls the g5 square and it prepares our bishop's development to g5. But let me be very clear, as obama would say, a little more before lumber before uh. This doesn't only protect g5. We also use the pawn as a battering ram and we prepared to advance it to h5. Why would we advance the ponce h5, because now this pawn on g6 is weak and the pawn from h5 would threaten to open the h file, which could be good for us or it can advance all the way to h6, and now it's literally a bone in black's throat, the bishop has to go either to f6, and now the knight can't develop f6 or it has to go to f8. So this brings to the table some very unpleasant consequences. Okay. That is why I really really like the move: h4 our opponent, understandably enough played h5, but now we get our bishop to this incredibly just solid outpost on g5. He tries to dislodge it, but in doing so he weakens all of these dark squares around his king, which, after completing our development, we are able to occupy with our pieces and use as the basis for future attack. This move, knight, f6, was a mistake. Uh I missed the move, knight, d7 and here we just said all right. I'm sorry, I'm going back, let's complete our development, first double the rooks, and only now on a second attempt. We go knight f6. Only when we're ready to do okay, uh. We have a great question from noisy miner. What, if black would have played the cunning h6? The idea of h6 is: he brings the g5 square under his control and if we go h5, he goes g5. Well. When I look at this pawn on g5, I see a hook. I've explained the concept of a hook before what can we do with this? So how do we exploit? What should white do here? This is a very, very typical sequence, right, h5 and now the following move, which is what let's rip open, that king side boom f4. If he takes look at his bishop, we might put a queen on g4, I mean that entire kingside is in a world of hurt, and so white has uh tremendous attacking possibilities here and I'm not claiming that um. That white is uh winning, but I I tru. I do think that this is well. I I think this is um one. Second, when do you know when to blow up side center? Well, we have the center control, we have more development than our opponent, and so we kind of know that we should open up the center. In any case, that was that game, and then the final game was a very simple one. This move, bishop b7 is just what I wanted to emphasize. A lot of people would want to play the move d4, but but the move d4 would be counterproductive. Uh- and I want to make the point here that it's not all about grabbing space in in chess, okay, uh, because the move d4 it may look productive, but what it actually does is. It closes up the center. It closes up the center and it allows white to to justify his. You know over zealousness with his queen, because now the queen comes back to e2, where it's perfectly safe and when the center is closed, a lead of development isn't as easily and strongly felt as it is with the center open. For obvious reasons right, you know it's just that the center is closed. So you start the slow maneuvering game. Okay, so I just wanted to make the point that d4 uh is a move that may look good, but in reality it closes the center and that favors uh, generally speaking, the side that is lacking in development, any questions, any questions or shall we move on to the next set of games? Wow 2500 viewers, crazy question by mariel. 100, yes, go ahead. How can we assess what please be specific? I would love to be a high school teacher. Yes history. Maybe I will be one day when do you move the rook up and then to the center? I'm not again. I it's hard for me to answer those kinds of general questions assess to open up center if they have vulnerable pieces. Well, okay, so let me put it this way. There's three: let's imagine a situation where there is tension in the center okay, and this is what I would call quantify as tension right. There's two pawns that are out of standoff, there's three fundamental things that you can do. You can not do anything and simply continue developing. You can actively try to open up the center more and release the tension. That's d takes e4 or you can try to close the tension with d4, let's uh, thank you, king moog, for the prime and we can transfer that to a bunch of scenarios. Um. Generally speaking, the first of these options, uh, is what I prefer unless it is specifically good in some way to continue opening up the center, because, generally, when there is a source of tension such as pawns at a standoff, you want your opponent to be the one to release that tension and help. You put your pieces on better squares, my friend, dana mckenzie, a national master and he's actually a best-selling author. Now he calls this moving your opponent's pieces. Uh. You want to be very careful about moving your opponent's pieces. Your white is essentially moving my knight to a better square to an outpost on t5. So that is why players who are able to keep the tension in certain positions are very very successful, because that is not an easy thing to do. Okay, there is no algorithm that I could offer, but this is the closest I can come for this board. Would you check the king of bishop before ask trout man, good question now? Bishop b4 would be good, were it not for the annoying move, c3 blunting, the diagonal and attacking the bishop. So you could do this right. You could drop the bishop to a5 and then to b6. That would be a perfectly viable maneuver, but uh if it were not for the move. C3 bishop b4 would cause some trouble. Although I guess white could play bishop d2 also and develop the bishop. I generally think that bishop before check or bishop gefora is overrated, you want to be sort of developing with check is good, but it's not always as good as it may appear. [Music].
