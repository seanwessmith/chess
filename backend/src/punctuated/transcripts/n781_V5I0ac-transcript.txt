[Music], so, okay, let's go e4. Well, it's not it's an office okay. So he plays the perk and I've sort of ranted about not recommending the perk to people, and hopefully I'm gonna demonstrate why that is uh. So he can play e5 here. Okay, that's the philidor! That's that's a version of the philidor and a lot of people don't understand in this position. Why is it that white doesn't take on e5 and then we can take the queen forces king to lose castling rights? The problem is when you've traded queens the king losing its castling rights. It just isn't as as powerful as when the queens are on the board. So d takes e5 is a move, but we're just going to keep developing with knight f3, which is the main line. Then we're going to develop okay. So he takes we're obviously going to take with the knight, and there are several ways that we can go about playing this position. We can we can go for long castles. We can go for short castles. The way that I like to play. This is actually to put the bishop on d3 to lend some more reinforcements to this pawn on e4. That's our only central pawn, so it makes sense to develop our pieces in a way such that we keep the spawn protect. Now. What should we do with the night? Should we take it? Should we drop our night back? What do people think this is actually quite an instructive moment, so I actually think we should not take it and after the game. I will explain exactly why. I believe that now both moves are fine, we're dealing here with marginal differences, but I do think it's an instructive moment in decision making we're going to drop our knight back and then continue developing the basic of it. The long and short of it is that by taking, we give him more pawns in the center and we help him uh orchestrate something like d5, which here would not be possible. Now the reality is, we've got a bigger share of the center than our opponent does, which means white is slightly better and we've got very free development. So after the game, I'll show uh some more reasons why I didn't take, but quite an instructor. Now, how should we go about expanding in the center? We can, of course, develop our bishop, but we don't actually always have to do everything strictly by the book. We can start expanding a little bit in the center and on the king side, we've developed enough pieces to where this is fine uh. We can deal with this bishop a little bit later. We don't always have to you know complete our development by the book at this level. Uh you've got to be able to improvise a little bit and and know when to do something a little bit more ambitious and he's developed relatively passively. So we can afford this uh. You know, especially so rook e8, now a couple of things that we could do here right. We could push this pawn to f5. Now. The downside of that mode is that we would give him the e5 square for his knight. That's a very nice central outpost um. So in this kind of situation, it's a good idea to make a general improving move now. What does that mean? First of all, bishop e3 is absolutely possible, but I'm thinking of a slightly more aggressive move. Let's look at this queen for a second, it's just sort of sitting there on its initials. Can we put it on a on a nice little square where it's controlling both yeah good job, guys queen f3, is exactly what I'm thinking about. Bishop e3 might have walked into knight g4, which would have been a slight tiny bit nasty. So you'll, see this very often f4, followed by queen f3, is a typical idea. What we're basically doing is is we're waiting for him to show his cards right. He might play d5 and then that'll that'll help us understand how we want to play this uh. But there are certain positions where you don't know exactly how your opponent is going to arrange his pieces. There we go see now, there's clarity to the position. We know that he's he's lost, his cool he's lost his patience and, of course, as as we know, we don't want to take here and play into his hands. That's why we played f4. We played f4 partially so that we could meet e5 with with d5, with e5, forcing his knight back okay. For some reason he just gives up the pawn. I don't see what his compensation is going to be now, which way should we take on e4, and this is actually a tricky question that I'm asking you guys. So both moves are fine. Now, the case to be made for taking with the queen is that we are threatening checkmate, but that's actually not. The reason that I want to take within the reason I want to take with the queen consists in this move. I saw that he was going to play g6 and it looks like this battery has been blunted. The aaa battery has run out of power, he's going to go bishop f5, but there is a tactical idea that we have here. If you notice how strong this battery is, can we break through let's go f5 now I'll put it this way guys. This is not as simple as it looks, he's got. What I think is okay, so of course he falls for it. Bishop takes a five we take with a rook. This is very typical, attacking exchange sacrifice, and he simply has no defense to queen takes h7, which is going to be checkmate. If he tries to move his king, our bishop would come out to h he's probably going to do. That would be my guess: uh king f8, all of the checks are covered, not that they even do anything. So it there's. Actually, I think, a semi-refutation to the move f5, which was very complex, I'll, show it after the game. He simply resides good now. First of all, why not take on c6? So there's a couple of things here. First of all, as I hinted at the during the game, do you guys see how? Even though yes it's true, we make more pawn islands? Yes, it's true doubled pawns, but you guys know that I always urge you to put pawn structure in proper context. Pawns may look ugly, but they may actually be fulfilling a very important role and now d5 is much easier to to organize, and this is just like a bumper on a car. You know it's going to be hard for me to to to get past that the other thing is that he gets a b file for his rook. So if I ever try to develop my bishop, he can tickle me with rook ba and he can potentially either force me to make my rook passive or make the knight undefended and, and all these things you know taken together. They get annoying. So I decided to drop the knife back now. Why can somebody explain to me why d5 is not possible here or why is it inadvisable and another very typical tactical yeah evil now is correct, so ed takes takes and then, in the end the queen hangs very typical scenario: bishop h7 uh. If you've solved your fair share of chess.com problems, you should you should be able to recognize this pattern very quickly and if you haven't then well, here's your introduction to the discover check and by the way, if you've gone d5 with black and your opponent is taken, and you have realized that you've just blundered. It's not too late to double back right. You can go 95 and give up on it's better than putting your head down and stubbornly going for the losing line so f4, queen f3 and players in the 17 1800 rating range have a hard time at times just keeping the tension. I've talked about it before. What my opponent should have probably done is a move like bishop f8, which is a typical move in these positions. Dropping the rook back, allowing the rook more influence over the center black is slightly worse. Here. Black is passive, but he's also very solid, and it's hard for white to prove anything immediately. I would have probably developed the bishop and uh. You know the battle would have continued, but he kind of lost his cool with d5, knight, e4 and actually after f5. What would have been the annoying sequence so, instead of taking on f5, does anybody see what else he could have done? It's a move that he makes with tempo. He could have gone bishop d5 now that doesn't seem like a big problem in and of itself because we can move the queen away, but what you should notice here is this rook on e8 there's two things: the rook on e8 and the fact that, as soon as you play the move, f4 you absolutely somewhere in the back of your mind, you need to tell yourself: okay, this diagonal has been weakened, so I need to watch for bishop c5 as weird as it sounds. You have to make that mental note to yourself very, very quick, very, very early in the process, so that you get a better chance to see tactics and, if you're alert to that then you'll see knight takes e5, that's not a blunder. This puts the queen in the x-ray of the rook and combined with the fact that we played f4, we lose the queen. Obviously I would not have taken on e5. Uh white can play f6 and the attack continues, but the position gets a lot more messy than it would have been. If we didn't do this, so that's actually why, if I was playing another gm, I would have taken the bishop uh, seeing that line, because now I'm threatening to win a second pawn and I've just got a very compact position and I'm up upon so basically that's the reason why I think f5 is a little bit objectively dubious and I just verified that with the engine yep bishop d5 was very strong. Instead, he falls for it right. Bishop takes f5 and after gf we would have played rook takes f5, it's the same exact effect. There's simply no defense to the devastating queen takes h7. Does that make sense to everybody any questions and please don't be afraid to ask questions. I I say this a lot and I mean it every time we're here to learn and I want to make sure everybody is included and it doesn't matter if you're 200 or 1200 uh, I you know you should never be afraid to ask anything, boring democracy. Thank you for the sub, all right, uh, perfect uh. If king f8, we would have come back here and now, let's check me so basically that that's how we would have met that all right. Well, we're 1800! Let's continue um, let's continue so so far. You know. I I like the time control, even though the games have gotten more complicated they're, not like okay, 2100, wow. Okay, this is a serious dude, never mind it's, not a serious dude yeah. I think he aborted, because we were a little low rated, that that happens. Okay, marco 981, damn it would have been a good opportunity, but we'll get there. We will get there and he plays the modern and we've encountered the modern a lot right. The modern is where you fee and kettle the bishop immediately. It often transposes into the perk, but he plays something called the gurgaons system. It's like a cross between the karo khan and the the proper modern black prepares to go d5. There's a lot of ways that we can meet the gurken say, but one system which is often very underestimated, is to get the bishop to c4 immediately. The idea is to stop him from going d5, and this is a very common mistake that people make he simply puts a set as oh, let me prepare d5. What has he not noticed here? What very subtle move can I make now in order to cement the weaknesses that he's created with this move and I'll? Show um I'll show a game that really influenced me. That's a boom and look at this juice right. There he's got to go d5 now we take on passant, but now look what's happened as a result, his bishop is passive. He's still got a weakness on d6 he's brought his queen out early instead of developing his position is just going to be very, very cramped, he's going to have a very hard time developing naturally so we're going to continue our development of tevarium. Thank you for the prime we're going to continue our development and in this position. If we look at the tension between the knights by playing knight d5, he has relinquished his control over a very nice central square, which we can slam our knight into, and, of course you guys can see that potentially we could access d6. Now, how should we continue here? How should we continue developing actively very typical move? It should be on the top of everyone's mind. We could play c3, but let's play a little bit more ambitiously, let's try to induce f6, which would be a horribly weakening move. Thank you. These nudes for the prime appreciate that 3 a.m. Support guys loving the energy as we move toward 5 000 subs, can't believe it knight f6. Okay, so he's pinned himself. It would be great if we had a chance to apply pressure on the night. Unfortunately, we don't so. What we need to do here is realize: okay, um, his position is super passive. We need to sort of lay it on and we lay it on by and you guys are seeing this move by centralizing our knight and then look at the disparity in the pc. He's got to play age six and he doesn't do it and that's going to cost him tremendously, because we need to have what I call a wish list, and this wish list right is. It has to be updated on every move. I want to do this. Okay, and this might not be possible one move, but if you keep kind of mulling that wish list over in your mind now you see as a result of us putting in the 995 we can bring the queen out to f3 and his knight is going to simply be lost, and once we take the knight okay, we just take on f6. The knight is def, even if it wasn't defended and he gave up his fiance bishop. Well. Thank you for that uh. Even if we didn't take the queen, we would tr we would be able to deliver the lobster instrument. Well, that was pretty simple um, but basically his big mistake was: was this movie six and uh? This is something that you guys should be very attentive to this idea of like cementing these dark. Squared weaknesses exists across a pretty wide range of openings, believe it or not, and there was a very famous game uh by tigran petrossian, believe it or not, against a very competent player where he demonstrated how bad it can be to allow a weakness of this sword game that I was referencing petrossian against pacman, it was a grand master and pogman does something very similar to you guys see that he has created these two weaknesses. Guess what move petrosian plays here? Pacman didn't realize that he was preparing it by playing rookie one. What does petrossian do here? He plays e5 exactly same exact thing: pachman plays d6 much like our opponent did, and you know black has all of these weaknesses. Now that he's got to deal with and petrossian starts harassing him much like we did, you can see the same moves being played knight, e5 bishop develops with tempo, it's the same elements and petrosian one very quickly, so you can see the generalizations that we can make here now. If he doesn't go d5, then we can get our knight to d6. That would be even more disastrous, but basically we you know we just developed. Naturally we attack his queen. Now he should have moved his queen, but um now using an idea from earlier. In the day, we can try to chase his knight away by first moving, our bishop back and then advancing our pawn to remove the knight from d5 so he's in huge trouble already, but here it was his last chance to go h6 and forcibly uh and the pin, although it's still very, very bad bishop f6 and queen f3, comes to mind boy, oh boy. If he has to take this and look at these squares, the rook comes in. This is absolutely devastating. Why did you choose queen f3 overnight? G4 asks as roseanne yeah, so knight g4. I was a little worried about knight pd7, although here we could have gone queen f3, so it was equivalent, but the purpose of queen f3 first is if he goes knight d7. We can take the knight um, I think, you're, I think uh. We can just tolerate it. King kara, why is f6? Ask snow a new 200 such a weakening move for black? Well, it's just sort of the general effect. If you look at this move visually right, it weakens the e6 bond. It blunts the bishop, if he castles, there's just going to be more air in front of his king right, there's a sense in which he's just just look at this move right. Everything is everything here, just kind of becomes weak and that's all I mean right. It's just a visual thing almost and in particular this pawn on e6 is a sitting duck because the e-file is semi-open. So when you're judging pawn weaknesses, pawn weaknesses are especially disastrous when there's no opposing pawn on the file and which can be attacked. So if there was a white pawn on e3, then the pawn on e6 would not be such a big deal, but because the rook can come to e1 it has a direct line of fire to the pawn, which means that we need to be very careful before we make a weakness like this yeah. If he goes g5, I drop it back, but all of this creates even more weaknesses. You give up the pawn, so this never works right. When you push pawns like that, you almost invariably create too many weaknesses. Even if you end up winning a piece, your position often remains so weak that it's not worth doing it uh, just you know just because you won't be able to contain all of the weaknesses. As a result. Let's continue. Can I play the modernist block sure I I don't. I wouldn't mind doing something like that: uh showing how it should be played, because the modern used to be one of my main openings, so I am going to play the modern which I've never done before yeah. It looks like this. Guy's gonna have some connection problems now. The modern, as the name reveals, is a hyper-modern opening. Hyper-Modern openings, I remind you. They really began in the 1920s when there was a group of chess players that included rehard retsy. You know the ready opening and they said you know. Why is everybody saying that you have to control the center with your pawns? I don't think that's entirely the case. Here's what we're going to do! What we're going to do is we're going to let our opponents control the center with pawns. Then we're going to attack those pawns from a distance with pieces that we put on very specific, sheltered positions. It's like trench warfare, we're going to put a bishop on g7, we're going to feed and get of that bishop. We're going to you know we're going to provoke all these moves and then we're going to attack that center with our pieces. That's the sort of rationale behind the hyper modern openings. Thank you! Hydro cow, the prime yeah. This guy is having bad connection and okay I'll, give him a draw uh. I offered him a draw. I obviously don't want to take his rating, given his internet he's declined it okay! Well, I guess in that case, we'll have to play um yeah, I'm not sure why he declined it. I think he didn't see it so well. What do you? What is the point of jesus? Well, the point is, is to do what's called a fianchetto, that's an italian term which means to deploy the bishop on the longest diagonal on the chessboard, and you can understand right just intuitively that the bishop controls mathematically speaking more squares when it sits on the long diagonal and in addition you can see that, even though he's occupied the center, our bishop now immediately applies pressure on that pond. So now we have to develop our pieces in such a way as to apply consistent pressure on his center, while also developing our pieces in a healthy fashion. That's a hard thing to do, which is why modern's a hard opening to play? Well, okay, I'm sorry! He lost on time, so we're just going to have to move on. Thank you for the sub with zako91 okay moving on. Hopefully we can oh we're playing he dog, so we'll play another modern, uh and, and let's see if he goes e4 to transpose, if not we'll play the king's indian uh, maybe I should have just started with the kingston, so he plays the london system and I'm going to play the king's indian setup against the london system to show you guys how to deal with it with the king's indian setup. I know he can play e4 and I'll explain later the transpositional issues. Now the thing is here: the thing is interesting: we haven't developed our knight to f6 and we can actually use that as a good thing. Why is that a good thing, because it might be easier for us to prepare the move e5 striking in the center? Now we can't play e5 immediately because he's got one two three defenders on the square and we've got only one two attackers: how can we prepare the movie five and how can we prepare it in such a way that after e5 d e, we don't allow a queen trade knight d7? That's a very typical king's indian move, it's more common than going knight c6, because knight c6 keeps that line of negotiations open between the queens which might result in us losing castling rights. After we go e5 now we can go e5 yeah. You can play c5 in these positions too, but it's more king's indian need to go for the e5 pod break. That's more principled! Now, a couple of things right. First of all: let's not go knight f6, because that would blunder the pawn, but we still need to develop the knight, and we need to be very careful about how we do this uh one option is to develop it to e7. Another option is to reinforce the pawn on e5 preemptively and then deploy the knight to its traditional square on f6. How can we deploy? How can we defend this pawn preemptively? And I don't want to hear anybody say f6, because you know where that leads we can play queen e7, actually we're following. I think, a game that I played in 2013 exactly in this position. So now we keep our options open. Maybe we'll play knight h6 knight f5, as uh as one person suggested. It depends what he does. Okay, so he's allowed us to go knight f6, which means we will uh it's not. This isn't like that theoretical, but I've I've definitely seen games like these before so now we have a nice compact position. Pawn on e5 is protected and uh. Well, we'll we'll see what he does, but um I mean for white. You know he needs to also complete his development, so he's probably thinking about where to put this bishop. No, I don't plan to castle queen said that would be a little bit too much uh, because that would involve me fianchettoing, the other bishop. It would be interesting, but let's play it more traditionally by castling now um. Obviously we have the question of this bishop. What should we do with this? I just mentioned it, but what should we do with this bishop? How do we develop it because remember if we move this knight uh, we might drop the pawn on e5. We don't want to do that and that's where the fiance is so good. Fianchettoing is really good when the bishop can't develop along it's sort of main diagonal, because there's some sort of traffic right or there's a piece that cannot move. That's where fianchettoing comes in, so double fianchetto. Both bishops are fianchettoed crisscrossing the board. I kind of like those types of setups knight h5, was possible for sure. There's different ways to play this position, we're doing it in a more traditional way, we're sort of developing and there's nothing wrong with that, but you could also play it a little bit more creatively, so the movie e4 would be a very instructive mistake and I'll explain why we actually might be almost following that game I played in 2013. I'll, show you guys what I mean so the move, e4 yeah would have been a little bit weakening. Okay, um welcome to all 3000 you'll be finishing in about 15 minutes, though. So, where do we go from here? What's going to be the plan of action? Well, it depends on what he goes. H3 again, no need to reinvent the wheel. Let's simply identify pieces that are not doing anything and bring them into the game. Exactly rook d8 is a start and while we're doing it right and we don't want to go rookie though rook e would be unnecessary because we have enough defenders on the pawn already or do we because here's the thing if we look at the position carefully right, you guys can see that we're occupying this d file. So wouldn't it be nice if we could move this knight out of the way so that the rook could actually do something on that d-file. Well, there's a problem: if we move the knight immediately, we drop the pawn on e5. That's a problem. We've already ran into so we need to solve that problem before we move the knight from d7, and some of you have already suggested ways that we can do it, we can go knight h5 exactly the point is, of course we want to take this bishop and ruin his structure, but the main point of this move is to open up the bishop's defense of the pawn. Now we can go knight c5. Now we can go knight c5 and we can allow our rook better control, the d5 it shouldn't blood. My bishop, but but but again uh, sometimes the position gets complex and not every one of your pieces will be ideal uh, but you can see that we're sort of opening up our controller, but this bishop is super nice, it's sort of really sizzling through the board. It's it's! It's a good bishop and um. Isn't the bishop still pressure? Well, yeah? Our bishop is defending a very important central part. Remember I've said this many times, one of your pieces or more can be performing a defensive role. There's nothing wrong with that. So we have several ways that we can go about. He's actually made a mistake. He's blundered upon now what knight f1 has done. If we look at all of our pieces, what has he allowed us to do? What has he allowed us to do absolutely? And we don't do this to ruin his spawn structure. We do it to ruin the pawn structure because his king is there and now we have a fork. It's a very unusual fork. How do I find it undefended pieces? You should always be looking out for them. This is an undefended piece and pawns are included in that equation. So we see several weak bonds have been created as a consequence of the trade and combining these observations, the bishop and the pawn queen to h4 comes to mind attacking the bishop attacking the pawn. That's a pretty disastrous loss for him because his king is going to get caught in the crossfire okay. So it's not only important as a standalone concept to look for undefended beats, but particularly when there's been a big time, trade right when you've ruined a structure like this, you should expect that there will be new weaknesses that are created which might be the subject of a fork. So you exploit a previously undefended piece and something that's just been created. Bingo, let's take the pawn and now we're going to hatch a plan to continue the king side attack, obviously we're attacking on the king's side, so knight g3 um. Well, if we take the knight well, there's no need there's no reason not to take the knight, let's, let's clear up some of the tension here. So we can better understand the situation, and now we need to find a way to, as I say, add some tabasco sauce to the king's side and tabasco sauce can come in various forms. It would be nice if we had a rook left, so we really don't have a rook lift because there's too much pawn traffic. So that leads us to the thought. Well, okay, if there's pawn traffic, we might as well use our pawns, and so the move f5 comes to mind right. We just drive the spot to f4, we clear some of that pawn traffic, let's get our queen back first, and that opens up the potential for a rook lift through f5. Thank you, rasheed appreciate the five months man, okay, so he stops us in our tracks. Question you ask yourself immediately when a pawn is pushed like this, what weak squares have been left behind and also there's there's many ways, many ways in which we can go about this e4. Very nice, guys, good observation skills, but um, I'm going to show you guys a slightly different approach, which is to use your pawns as battering rams right. This pawn and f4 looks like it's solid as a rock, but what can we do to try to get this pawn out of the picture so that we can then go f4 and continue the attack? It's a typical idea. G5 is absolutely correct. Now. What makes me think that I can get away with such well. This isn't even really a sacrifice if he takes on e5 after f4 just intuitively. You should realize that with a king like this, there's just no way he's going to survive. We could trade queens here. That wouldn't be the worst idea, but obviously we want to end the game with a checkmate, so we're going to drop the queen of g6 onto a square word x-rays, the king. I didn't just choose a square random. Now we don't even need to play a four. We can collect the pawn first uh, no need to rush with that. With that move now we can go f4 right so so, when you can collect the material back, there's no need to force yourself to sacrifice. Okay, he gives us a check. Now. The problem is going to be that if his bishop moves away from g3, what move are we going to have to end the game? Well, and hopefully our opponent will allow us to show this. Of course we go f3 typical lobster, pins or idea winning the other bishop with checkmate, and that's over he's got to give up this bishop and the attack rage is on and uh yeah. The game is over, so one simple idea really did it in yep f3. Okay, so again we don't need to rush to take the bishop uh. Let's actually bring some more beef to the g-file okay. Now we have to take it. Okay, let's just simplify now notice that there is a line of fire to uh to the king. So we can just take a bunch of this stuff. Okay, he's threatening bishop e5. So let's cover that and checkmate with the knight sorry, I had to go a little bit fast in the end. Okay, that was an interesting game. So here, let's actually compare uh that game. I referenced uh that game. I referenced you guys from 2013. Let me see if I can find it all right, so basically um yeah. Actually it was exactly the same thing. This position was reached in one of my games and- and he went c3 so very, very similar, as you guys can see queen e7 literally. Oh my god. I think this was the exact same position yup. So with the difference that my opponent had his bishop on e2 and e dog had his bishop on c4. So literally, I did exactly the same literally exactly the same stuff and I did go e5 and get my knight to d3. So you can see that if you, if you take your game seriously, you can learn from them and you can apply them directly to you know to your blitz scheme. So I had an inkling that that was what I was doing, but I didn't remember how similar it actually was uh. So in any case, b6 defean kettle the bishop, but basically everything we did was was very much uh very much straightforward and e49d3 becomes an idea here. It's exactly what we practiced for and knight f1 was the big mistake. So edog could have considered b4 attacking the knight now what nice tactical move does black have in this position yeah? So I don't know if you guys mean g4 or b4, we'll consider both so b4 attacks, the knight we don't automatically move our knight we ask ourselves: can we counter attack one of his pieces? We actually can. What move can we play bingo e4? We attack his knight. If he moves his knight, we have knight d3 and if he takes twice much like in my game, we have c5 winning the night number one number two. If he takes his knight um our knight, then we take his and this pawn is like a flamethrower right. It's it. This pawn is going to disappear, but it's going to take a big chunk of the king side. Security with it, and this check comes white's position is completely devastated, not to mention we can just win back the pawn. If we want it. What does the computer say? Your accuracy was 99.9. I don't think so. Um my accuracy, if you're curious, was no no definitely not 99 95.7 good, but I'm sure some inaccuracies were committed now if he goes g4, then that just creates a huge weakness. I mean look at how much it weakens his king. We can just drop our knight back and uh, even if we give up the pawn that doesn't matter because we've already done. Actually we have a tactic here. Oh black is a very pretty tactic here, noticing that this knight is overloaded. What can we do to it now? If we take the knight, then the other knight replaces it, but that's what should set your brain emotion? Aha, what if we take that other knight queen takes? We take this knight if the knight takes, then we take the bishop. We've got two pieces for a rook and a huge attack so basically well queen h4 was a fork. Takes get these pawns back g5 using the other pawn as a battering ram, trying to dislodge the f4 pawn right and uh. We could have absolutely gone 94 as well trying to get a rook to d2 many roads lead to rome here and uh. It was. It was probably just as good, if not even better, but I wanted to sort of uh. You know to go after him more more directly. So basically that was what if he had placed the bishop on h4 instead of h2 uh. Well, he he couldn't have done that right because uh, because we would have just taken it, but maybe there was a different moment: oh yeah, so he could have gone to h4. In fact he probably should have, but here and when you have to deal with a with a situation like this. What do you guys think I should cover on f6 with so rob? Please stop I'm! I am active on youtube and let's be productive, yeah bishop f6, because the bishop is kind of bad anyway and uh trading. That piece is kind of good for us now. I know we create a little hole here, but at least we've traded off a piece. That's sub sub optimal right now. Some of you guys are looking at this and saying: how did I know to play g5? Doesn't this weaken my own king and I always repeat the same thing here. You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs in chess. At some point, you have to take risks right. You can't have it all against good players. You'll have to take measured risks such as yes, slightly, exposing your own king. Could this backfire? It can has it backfired in my career? Absolutely, but that's just part of the beauty of the game is making those judgment calls okay, [Music]. You.
