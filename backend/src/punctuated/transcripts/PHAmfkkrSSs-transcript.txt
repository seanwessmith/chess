[Music] all right, omar, atef, okay, let's go e4 guys. This is all going on youtube. In fact, several videos are out already all right. We're gonna go knight, f3 and we have been playing the italian, which is, which is an opening that emphasizes classical principles. That's why I'm playing it d6! Now we have already faced this move and you guys those of you who remember what do we do here? What have we decided to do here to control the center? What have we decided to do to control the center? Not d4 immediately we want to prepare d4. D4 is a good move, but we want to prepare it. How do we prepare d4? How do we prepare e4 yeah? We want to go. C3 d4 is fine, but we like to occupy the center with our pawns now also it um it poses it. Remember. In a previous game, we played the move queen b3, so when he gets his bishop out of c8, if you've seen the morphe opera game, you know that these pawns- okay, so the previous guy did the same thing. We take it ruining his structure in front of his king. Queen b3 by the way, is a fork, but it's not a good one, because black has queen c8. So let's just go d4: let's not do anything crazy. He takes we take. We have a beautiful center. He has a weak king. We have an advantage. He goes e5 all right now, according to our principle that we have formulated- and this gets a little bit complicated- do we want to close the center? Are we closing the center based on our discussion two games ago? Actually, we do not well, we can closing the center, I would probably play and after the game I will show why but this game, let's practice keeping the center open. So, let's just develop our pieces. We can close the center, which is an exception to the rule, but here we're going to keep it open just to practice playing with an open center, which you guys actually need more of don't worry. I will explain exactly why we could have closed the center after the game. Now we take with the queen. My guess is a lot of people go c5 in a position like this, a lot of people not realizing that they're weakening the square. I can guarantee you probably 50 of players like him will go c5. No, he goes knight f6. What do we do broken monitor? Thank you so much. What do we do we castle nothing to invent here? We castle, we don't need to so eve, morgan I'll, explain, e5 in a moment. Thank you shaq. Why not so he's making a very classic mistake, he's trying to intimidate us by putting a knight on a square where it's not actually doing anything. Thank you kit for the sub. What do we do? Do we respond? Do we react or do we just keep developing? We can chase the knight away with h3, but I want to show you guys that we can completely ignore and we don't have to do anything just keep developing. Let's keep developing bishop f4. Also, this supports the bond, so the queen h4 doesn't does no longer come with a maid threat. Let's keep that train rolling, loving, loving it guys. Thank you for the support. We don't react now in addition to just moving the same piece twice: okay, and as soon as we do nothing. What do we do now? Do we move the bishop? Do we reactively move the bishop, or do we apply the principle? Every time a pawn is moved. We try to understand what weaknesses have been left behind. Thank you. Thank you for the rook. Thank you for the pawn and in addition, his knight is now undefended. His king is wide open. Boom boom fork, knight, undefended wide open rook. I only have a knife. Do I even have a fork basic? I'm super basic. I don't even have a fork. I just have knives and spoons, but you get the point we need to think about forks. Do we have a fork? Do we have a fork we do, but not here, since the queen goes to that square boom boom boom. The queen son of john won another sub. Thank you so much man. Thank you. Keep it rolling all right. We win the piece. Okay ratings are refunded, just reminding you guys, yeah bore 3d of you. Queen g5 would have been better because it would have covered both potential forkable squares. He could have also dropped his knight onto a defended square he's, obviously still completely lost because he's down a million pieces. I should not pre-move queen takes g4 because maybe he'll go queen g6 hoping for that. Pre-Move he'll play king e7 and after king e7 we apply another principle, never play a single move automatically unless it is literally the only move that is forced always take a moment to search for better moves, and you guys are amazing, knight, d5 check would be a fork and a much greater fork after king e7. So his only moves are king, d8 and king d7, and he maybe should block the queen. Okay, so he's busted lenser with 500 bits. That's right, amazing and oh, my god, and we gotta stop sir t bone subscribing with prime holy smokes. You guys I'm loving this. I am loving. This he's stalling. That's! Okay! That's! Okay! In the meantime, wasting no time jose, src subscribing with twitch prime he's disconnected. So I think he is not very happy our accuracy level so far in these games has been pretty high and he he whoa- oh my god, g cook 17 29.5 gifted, oh my god. Oh my god, guys. Sorry, I'm screaming, but I'm excited skirmish. Just gifted 10. holy smokes. What is going on here? We have an explosion. G cook 1729, then skirmin 10, gifted subs to puddi chulu loves you so wild it's kuala null. I am scrabby and gm donald trump I joined only because of oh my lands. Oh my lens! This is ridiculous. Okay, guys the energy has arrived. I can even extend the stream. We got wawa sc gifting we got tbj with the sub gsw 2017 go warriors with five more subs and curious chimpanzee with 200 bits. Oh my god. I can't even talk about the game. Stop it! You guys, aren't letting me talk about the game right now. Oh my lance! This is this is an overwhelming, oh, my goodness, we're almost at 2 000. jacobs123 a sub to nick richardson. Okay. But let's talk about the game. Thank you guys so much. I really agree. This is amazing, raider raider rampage, priming twitch, prime, and this is percolating- we're going crazy, okay, so of course, of course, thank you guys. This would not be possible without this kind of support, so um the you know, the credit belongs to you guys. Thank you so much all right, so the move d6 we have already discussed is bad because it doesn't develop anything and it obstructs the development of the bishop. As we have talked about the main moves here, our bishop, c5 and knight f6 there's also the hungarian variation bishop e7, which is reasonable. It's a little bit passive, but I have played this move myself. Thank you guys. This is you're making me blush so d63 and bishop b6 we've already had this. The last guy. Please help me with this with a with a sub. Thank you for the three months the last guy played d5, which is actually a very reasonable move. This guy takes the pawn and we take back now we get the c3 square for the knight and he goes e5. This is the main moment in the whole game. Let's talk a little bit about how I decided not to close the center as a matter of fact, both moves are very, very good. It would have been a great idea to close the center now bishop g4, where bishop g4 can somebody who is paying very careful attention to the ideas white has in this position. Tell me what white does here. What does white actually do here, and this is an idea that we've already seen before that I actually mentioned in this game. I already mentioned this this in this game. Yeah queen b3, is right, so queen b3 is correct, um, because I'm I'm very happy to hear that super duper. Shiny yeah, queen b3, is right. It's too early to take on f7, but the move queen b3 has the same idea now we're preparing to take on f and if white black takes on f3. I mentioned this previously. We have this checkmating mechanism that people should remember. Black does not have any way to guard both pawns at the same time in morphe's opera game, which is quite possibly the most famous and the most overrated game of all time. We have seen uh that sorry morphe went d e. We saw that morphe did something very, very similar. He forks the pawn in the pawn and um. That basically was how the opera game started. It's it's exactly the same idea, okay, so he goes to edd5 now d5. Now we have discussed the principle that when we have a lead in development and when we have when your opponent is a weak king, it is usually not a good idea to close the center, because we make it harder for ourselves to access his king. We make it harder for ourselves to take advantage of our leading developments, but the reality is that here, specifically, we have a maneuver that is so strong that it actually justifies. It justifies us closing the center and it is only because of this maneuver being possible that it is fine to close the center as well. So it's a very concrete moment. Could somebody spot what I'm talking about here, bingo potato for president? You deserve a sub. My man, lord adamson, knight you 5, look at this look at this look at this knight this outpost and that's why you need to be very attentive to outposts is going to be a monster. It is literally look at this monstrosity on e6. It's not letting black castle either way. Black literally is paralyzed. Now we're gonna go bishop g5 and we're gonna open up that f-file and crash through and check my plaque. So actually this is probably white's best move. Now, if you are on the receiving end of such a situation, let's look for, let's say you're playing black. Damn you allowed a outpost like this to happen by accident. Is there anything that you can do and be sharky comment to play with a thousand? Thank you so much np sharky. What do you do? Is it completely lost? You can use what we discussed undermining. You could play c6 and you can try to undermine the base of the outpost. It doesn't actually solve black's problems, because here, white can kind of ignore him and the pawn is a little bit weaker though so this gets a little bit complicated. But if you are on the receiving end of an outpost, see if you can undermine the piece or the pawn that is holding the outpost, that is defending it, okay, in order to try to get out of the situation. Thank you, sufultra for gifting to patel for president appreciate it. Okay back to reality, we decided to keep the center open just to practice playing in these kinds of positions, um. Okay, so for those of you who are wondering, can black take the pawn you actually cannot? This is a good tactical idea, but it doesn't work because after knight takes d5. If we take thank you twit max. If we take knight 65, then queen takes d5. If we take queen takes e6, then fork fork for a fork. This is a family fork and we win the queen. So this is a little bit of calculation, but the knight is retained on e6, okay, so knight c3 is the move, and so he takes d4 knight takes d4 knight 64 queen takes d4. Just to remind you guys, the move c5 would have made things even worse because it would have weakened the square, and I want to use this because we only have time- maybe for one last one after this to introduce to you the concept of weak squares. I want to talk a little bit about positional chess and make a small detour. How do we exploit the weakness of the d5 square? Do we put a knight on d5 immediately? Could somebody tell me the plan and why is knight d5 immediately a bad idea? It's a bad idea, because we want a knight on d5. We don't want to trade pieces on d5. We want the knight to be on d5 all alone. The merciful, sermon, beautiful bishop g5, take the knight and stick this beauty on d5 you can castle. First too, you might ask me: how did I know to do that? Where am I pulling this line up? Well guess what, when I was about seven or eight, every single russian schoolboy is always shown a game uh. That is a very classical game which features precisely this planet is a game between smithslav former world champion soviet union and rutakovsky a master. It is a game played in 1945 and it is a game precisely in which this plan was applied by smithslav. This position occurred on the board. What do you think smithslav did here? What do you think smithslav did here? Can he play an it5? No, he can't that's terrible, but what do you do boom boom boom and that wins the game, because this knight is so strong black can take the pawn, but here smith's love can deliver a fork, there's a little tactical justification. Basically, that is what's missed loved it. Everybody has shown this game you guys might be like daniel. Has this ever happened to you. Have I ever allowed a knight on t5 uh? Have I ever allowed a knight to come to d5 and gotten crushed? I absolutely have I absolutely have, and let me show you guys a good example of that. Let me show you guys a good example of that. I know the cursors go crazy here, but I will. I will flip the game in a moment: got a kamsky one of the most legendary players of all time, literally a famous fn legend. This is my game against kamsky from the u.s championship 2017., I played a ray lopez and guess what happened to me. What has got to do in this position? Bishop g5? Now he gets his knight around. He takes any and, and he tr look at you- have the components of that plan boom boom boom. Okay. So it's happened to me and I got crushed and this plan is one of the most classical plans in a lot of different positions. The outpost specifically on d5 is one that you have to look for and remember the plan of getting rid of the knight on f6 or whatever is guarding the outpost and then sticking the knight on the outpost. So I have plenty of games to show you that that's not the only time that this has happened. I have games on the opposite side. Where I have been the one um. You know basically sticking pieces on really really good outpost. Thank you lindsay for your support really appreciate it. Yeah and I'm finishing up in five minutes anyway. Okay, so for that reason this was bad for black. Let's go back to the speed, run and uh just the last couple of things basically um after bishop f4 g5 queen takes him. I mean he blunders a a rook, but it doesn't matter he's already in huge trouble because because he cannot get his bishop out and queen takes, g7 is coming in and the game is over okay, so that is just I mean this is just terrible for black, and my plan here is perhaps to stick the knight on d5 or open up the center. There's a bunch of things that white can do here to end the game, and the rest is very simple here. He loses his his knight and the game is over guys. Yes, this will be uploaded. I am already uploading um. My editor has already uploaded big shout out to him. The first three parts of the speed run, um broken down into into bite-sized portions, going forward. The segments are going to be 30 to 45 minutes long, because otherwise the speed run is going to be a very, very long one. Otherwise we're going to have 800 parts. I don't want to do that, but the first three segments, the first three games, have been uploaded to youtube: loving the support on twitch. But if you want to subscribe to youtube, I try to upload as much content as possible and uh. I would really really appreciate it. Thank you guys so very much for all the hype. Okay, I got time for one last game, one last game and then we're gonna go over it and wrap up. Okay ready guys. No, I am just a mere mortal figuring things out. Just like everybody, okay, I happen to be very passionate about this, but you guys make it possible. So let's go e4, let's actually, let's go d4, let's go d4 and I'm gonna play something a little bit different: okay, whoa and it's paying off already it's paying off already whoa. Okay. So I have a funny move here. I have a funny move here. I have no idea what this guy is doing. I actually can not move yeah I can play for. I can play e4, oh my god, jeez relax. What can I do now this guy's going to get what he's what he's looking for this guy is going to get exactly what he's? Looking for? How do I attack the spawn? How do I attack this yeah? I should be too. I don't know what he's doing, but he's landing himself in a little bit of trouble. This guy's landing himself in a little bit of trouble and if he takes my bishop, I take on h5, and this is checkmate in two moves. Yeah now watch him start playing really well. This is like a gambit that he's analyzed. You know for many many years but again, okay, so he he actually stops mate, but we can still take the pun, we're up two pawns and we're getting his king out into the open. I mean: could you possibly ask for more out of five moves? What do we do now? What do we do now and you got to be careful guys? Where do we move the bishop? Be careful because remember he wants to take on d4 and if we take back with the queen, the bishop on h5 is going to be lost, so we need to move the bishop on e3 to lend another protector for the pawn on d4. There's, no reason it wouldn't be a disaster to get that pawn up, but why? Why should we so we prepared to recapture and deform the bishop? That's that's basically the idea here: okay, that is basically the idea here and then we basically take one to four yeah. Okay, go to z6 um. There are several approaches here and I'm going to make a move. That looks very lit. Well, actually, no, let's develop a piece that we know we want to develop. What should we develop and be careful? Please, because the move knight f3, would be a blunder. We want to go knight c3, because now we're actually threatening knight c5, that's almost checkmate, so this is going to be fun. The move that I thought about playing and we're actually going to play this move here. Here's the thing guys! I want to develop this knight, but this bishop is a pain in the neck right now. Can we get this bishop somewhere safe so that we can complete our development? There are several possibilities, so we can try to trade this bishop. We can get it back. What can we do? Can you give me one move yeah. There should be two, so I'm gonna go bishop e2 to illustrate that sometimes it's okay to have a bishop on e2. Yes, the bishop is not super active, but we have extra two pawns. He has a king on e7, it's totally fine for one of one or more of your pieces to be on a quiet, passive square, provided that you have a good reason to put it there: okay, bishop h6, no reason not to trade. Let's take it and let's continue our development after that with knight f3 yeah. Let's just continue our development now think about which side you want to cast on which side do you think white should castle? This is actually a really instructive question that is going to be important to as well. Remember. He no longer has these two pawns, which means that if we were to castle king's side he would be ready made to start attacking. We would justify his strategy. We would castle long. So, let's prepare it again. We ignore the knight. Most people would go h3 here, but I want to, and so would I, but I want to emphasize that a knight on g4 doesn't actually always do anything, but we don't want to castle long just yet because we would drop the pawn on f2 with a fork so before we cast along, we do want to get rid of the night, but only because we're preparing to castle only because we're preparing to castle um, not because that night is actually doing anything. So, let's get rid of the night. Are we threatening to capture the night? Are we threatening to capture the night here? Well, we actually were not, but we would have moved the rook away now we're ready to cast along. We actually aren't, but we would have moved the rook away and then we would have been threatening to capture the night yeah. We can actually take this night. That's also possible, but remember what I tell you guys it's less important to ruin his fond structure, it's more important to ruin the structure around his king. Okay, let's get this out of here, even though it's not doing anything there, so bishop takes a6 doesn't actually ruin the structure around his king. I would not actually do that because it also opens up the b file. It helps him attack. What do we do in such positions? The time has come to open the center. Do we have a way to open the center guys? We don't. We don't even need g4g5. We have a ready-made way to open the center nope guys don't play d5. That is exactly what you want to avoid here. Just take the pawn just take the pawn open, the d-file take the pawn open up the center and we have already born the fruits of it. Now he's taking f65, we ask ourselves immediately: what are the drawbacks of the move? He has weakened the square, let's find a tactic together. What is this called guys, and I told you guys to pay attention to this. What is this called? The rook and the queen are in what relationship an x-ray. What do we look for when we have an x-ray? We look for a discovery. If we move this queen away and if this pawn were gone from d6, we would be winning his queen. So what move can we make to make both of these things happen? What is the tactic? Bingo knight takes e5. If d takes e5, we just give a check. That's it. We want to screen that's the importance of paying attention to these tactics, and the game is over. The game is literally over because not only does he lose his queen, it gets checkmated while he is at it, I'm not trying to pretend that it is easy to find tactics of all kinds. But when you are aware, when you are tactically aware, it becomes a lot easier to spot these hidden tactics. That is one of the drawbacks of solving puzzles. You know that there is a tactic, trivia question. We have checkmate in two moves. We actually can make a move before taking the queen that leads to checkmate and two find it. What is the move? No, we can take the queen and the rook normally. I would propose for that to happen but check, let's get a piece on f7 to block the king's escape, and now this is checkmate. We could have also taken the pinch very quickly, because I have to go in three minutes. Let's analyze, okay g5 is obviously terrible. It's also terrible after e4 I have faced the move once and I'll talk later about it. Um I'll talk later about it. I'm just going to write this down, but um we didn't do anything extraordinary. The movie 4 is very nice because we prepare to give checkmate okay. So this is all very, very simple bishop e2 we are threatening to take on h5 with checkmate and the key moment in the game that I want you guys to pay very careful attention to the move. This should be two. It doesn't look like anything, but it's actually a very important move. We, the bishop, has done its job. We drop it back to prepare the continued development. We bring all our pieces out. We don't do anything crazy. We don't go g4, we simply develop we castle long in order to not give him an attack. Had he done something like this, we could have just moved our rook out of the way and in addition to, in addition to just is there doing anything here or is it just staring at the pawn hint? It's actually doing something on g1. What is it doing? It is not actually staring at the pawn, it might supervise a potential g4. But didn't you say daniel that you shouldn't do this? I'm not saying that I'm just saying d take c5 is a simpler way to open the center. But if we do choose to pawn storm, we might have a rook poised to exploit the opening of the file okay. Instead, he does our work for us. We get the night out. D takes e5, and here already at this point as soon as we castle, I am already noticing the x-ray and by noticing the x-ray, it becomes a lot easier to find a tactic like this, because we simply apply the logical steps to make this x-ray into a discover check. What do we need? We need to get rid of the spawn distract it. We need to get rid of the screen. The best way to get rid of one of our own pieces is to do so with check. We have a check and we have a way to get rid of his pawn. He shouldn't have taken the knight, but it wouldn't have mattered, and now we find the best move, simple, effective unoriginal. We just do stuff that we know to do. We develop our pieces, measured solid thought through chest: no drastic movements. That is how you beat offbeat openings.
