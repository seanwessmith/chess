If you are somebody who tries to to teach yourself and- and you want to maximize your improvement, you have to try things out if you're, unsure about a certain way of playing right about where, when you weaken your king or when you make certain types of moves, just try it out right. You have to do a lot of experimentation. If you read the biographies of some of the greatest self-learners in history, people like thomas edison and people who didn't have access to. You know instruction in great quantities uh. What I think unifies them is the fact that they had the guts to experiment, uh and and fail many many many times and derive the lessons from their losses and their failures. So that is my very firm opinion on on how you should approach this process of understanding and finding your balance and finding your style [Music], and I know that this is all very general and uh. It's all well and good, but I just wanted to make that clear. As we come now come back, the server is back online, so we can continue playing. Is everybody ready to continue? Let's get that energy going, we have been playing the sicilian for the last couple of games by popular demand and we will continue to do so. Okay, so we faced this line a couple of times already. What is the main flaw of playing bishop c4 against the sicilian? It's the fact that we can play e6 at any moment, uh and blunt the bishop entirely. Now we don't have to play e6 immediately. We can develop our knight first uh and I would say that it's better to develop this knight over the other one, because if we develop the other one first, we might allow a little nasty move e5. So let's actually develop knight f6. We again, we don't have to hurry. Oh and f3 perfect. So now we play e6 and not only are we blunting the bishop, but when we play d5 we're killing two birds with one stone: we're opening up the center, which is particularly good. Now that he's played this move: f3, okay, um: how should we continue our development and uh? This speaks to the theme that I just talked about, which is that not every development move uh. It has to be an eat option of a vesuvius. You can just play normal development moves sometimes, and they don't have to be the most active moves right and uh. The move that I'm referring to here is either bishop e7, but let's play bishop d7. I don't want him to take on c6 and ruin my pawn structure, so I'm going to recapture with the bishop. Does that make sense we could have tried d4 setting a trap, because if he well anyways I'll talk about that later um, so I'm going to note this now. This is a very important moment: six, bishop d7, okay, now once again uh we can make a very standard development move and it isn't the most active one, but it's a pretty effective one. Thank you dukeduk94! So what do we do? How do we get out of this pin? How do we absolve ourselves of this pen? Here's two good moves. Please reserve your questions for after the game. One is bishop b7, but there is a slightly spicier move that we can play. We can actually move the queen. Where can we move the queen? I don't particularly like queen a5, because it's too, you know it's like you're putting your head down and barreling against the wall. Let's play queen b6. What is the purpose of this move? First of all, we're attacking the pawn ring. Second of all, I am already eyeing this diagonal. Why am I eyeing this diagonal because he's played f3 and by playing f3? He has weakened this diagonal so and perfect. So we can now play a move to make things explode, and this move is a direct consequence of the fact that he played f3 and he weakened this diagonal. This is a very standard kind of breakthrough. It looks it may look mysterious but uh, it's just a very direct conclusion. Uh of what he's done. It's it's a punishment. If you will c4 now we open up this diagonal, but that's not the only thing we open up he's, probably going to take on c4 to which we're going to respond. How what are we? Oh rook b1 is just too slow uh. We can actually win material. How can we win material? Think about all of the benefits of the move? C4. What have we opened up right? Bishop before is correct, attacking this knife. This knight lacks a defender that is a pawn and he can protect it with his other knight, but we can simply reinforce the pressure on the knight. With what move we got d4. Well, okay, he gives us the knight immediately with check now he's got to move the king. It's a total disaster, let's recapture the pawn, and now, let's chart, of course, toward finishing the game. This king is on e2. That should immediately call to mind uh the idea of what what should be the total. What should be the idea, and what is the best way to accomplish this idea? Long castle is correct. Very good and everybody sees it. We don't recon, there's okay, rookie 8! I don't even ask people because that's clear that you guys understand the idea here now after the king moves, we want to open up as many files as possible, so we're then going to play d take c4, but the point is not to like restore equality of pawns. The point is just to open up as many files as possible and diagonals and speaking of diagonals. There is a diagonal that we can open and we can put a bishop on that diagonal and basically checkmate him. So if we assume the queen moves to c1, which is the only possible square, I'm anticipating that he's either well, though okay, so what do we do now? What do we do now? Okay, now we just take the queen and uh. The rest is very simple: let's just infiltrate with our queen, potentially to e2 and well. I just got to make sure people are paying attention and the game is over very simple, direct and the rest is just going to be history, so he was already very much lost, but if he had moved to screen, perhaps we would have been able to demonstrate an instructive move. He's disconnected okay, so I think he might have, you know might have gone his own way here. Okay and he disconnects so we're over 1250. Let's play one more game here or actually two more and we are black against as as the zero. Let's see, let's go another sicilian and he goes knight c3 as well. Thank you, uh j root for another 500 bits now knight f3. We can go g6, essentially preparing for the accelerated and he goes d3. That's not a mistake, but it's not a very good move because he blunts his bishop and the only way to make d3 really work would be g3 transposing into a king's indian attack. But probably he's gonna go bishop e2 because I just have a feeling: yep, uh and well that's just very passive. I mean there's, there's very, very passive uh and he keeps the center closed, which is fine uh, but we've got very harmonious development. We've got a nicely fiance bishop, that's sort of controlling and skewering the whole diagonal and uh. He goes knight d5. So do we take the knight? Do we take the knight yeah speedrun? That is actually a slow run? Uh? Yes, we do. We absolutely do because we ruin this pawn structure and then, where do we put this knight, yeah knight p4? Exactly so? We attacked the pawn on d5 and in fact it's a double attack. We went upon and we just dropped the bishop back to g7. That's another thing that okay, so here we have a really cute move. If people want a five head, move, try to find the best square for the night and really think deeply about where the knight actually can go think about all of the weak squares in white's position. Yeah, you guys are actually seeing it. It's the move, knight a2, which looks incredibly scary, like isn't the knight gonna get trapped? Well, it's not because he cannot stop our knight from getting to c3, okay and he's not attempted to. He just blundered his rook in response. That's actually one of the positive byproducts of a move like knight a2. Is it it it shocks the opponent, uh and and oftentimes a blunder like this happens as a consequence, uh, that's actually in its option and he resigns uh, very good. Okay, so we're playing grand 25 and we have been playing the italian. But let's for some variety play the rye lopez. Let's play the red lopez, he's played the bird and the bird is one of those openings that that makes a lot of people scared, but the reality is. We should just play naturally right. First, we should take the knight and what is the most natural move uh in this position, just the most natural, no you're, not reinventing the wheel, not doing anything crazy or just castling right, even the move, d3 right. So so he goes c6. Now. Where should we put this bishop? What would be the most um active? I would say square for this bishop, given that we're retreating that would obviously be c4 yeah. He goes b5 big whoa right. We don't care uh pawns alone are not going to win the game, and this is actually already a very big mistake. If we look very carefully, he forgot to make one very important move, which is the move d6 and he's allowed us to push up our own pawn attack his knight he's going knight d5, but that is just asking for it. For what reason I mean, I'm not big on pawn structure, but you know that's not to say pawn structure isn't important. We just take the knight I mean queen. F3 is not even necessary. Look at his pawns he's got triple puns, uh, but, let's again not forget about development, let's not forget about the eye response uh. Let's not forget about the fact that we have to develop our queen side and we have to do it quickly. We have a very fine okay. We want to use twitch terminology. We have a very five head way of developing this bishop on c1. Think about what we want to accomplish right. The weakest of these three pawns is the d4 pawn. Can we use the bishop to attack that pawn? Can we use the bishop to attack that pawn like do? We have to develop this bishop to f4, or can we find a more creative way to develop it? Yes, we can there's something called the fianchetto okay uh. He has started to move his bishop back and forth. All right, that's great uh. We fianchetto we win the pawn. That was weird. Did I just hallucinate, did he just go? Bishop b7 bishop see he's having an attemptron right now, I think he's having any toughness yeah. I know I'm making one easy blah blah blah, and now, where should we put this knight? Well, we only have one square which is c3. That is a fork we're going to take d5 and we're going to win the game. Okay, there should be some now, I'm going to say something radical right now we don't actually even need to take this one right. We don't need to take this point. Why the hell not like what? What is it that we can do that is that is better than taking a free pawn. What do you guys think e6? I don't want to open the position up. E6 would be a very instructive mistake, actually uh, but the move queen g4, I really like, because it accumulates the attacking chances on the queen on the king's side. It accumulates attacking chances on the king side. Now the queen of the bishop alone are not going to deliver. The checkmate e6 would be very, very tempting, I know, but then black can go f6 and he can essentially blunt the influence of the bishop. So what we're going to do is play f4. We are preparing exactly two things. First is a rook lift, which I really like. The second is just a pawn push all the way to f6 and then we're going to deliver lobster pins are made on g7. Both of these ideas are competing for our attention and they're. Both very strong. The fastest is just to try to ram this pawn up to f6. Okay to his credit, he's defending well, but let's bring another piece into the game: let's bring the rook into the game, and what I want to emphasize in positions like this is: is that we're not actually in a hurry? There's no need to go crazy. There's no need to go for checkmate within three four moves, because uh, not only are we better tactically, we are attacking, but we are also better positionally. We are dominating him in terms of blockading the d4 square, let's open up the position and we have after bishop takes f6. Another very five head move: we have a move that crushes instantly and it's a very, very nice move, and how do I find this move? Well, I see that the bishop on f6 is immobilized. It cannot move back, so we play rook to e7. Bishop cannot capture the rook because of checkmate right and that's how I saw this move. I saw that the bishop was immobilized if he takes on d4 and we take with a queen repositioning it, but we're still threatening checkmate. He has to go rook f7 and after he goes, rook f7. Okay goes for cuff 6., my first inclination. Well, I have several inclinations uh. We can resort back to an idea that we had earlier. What is that idea that we had earlier, which may allow us to increase our attacking um potency? Oh yeah, we can just play knight 65, actually, that's a that's actually even better uh and that's not just a pawn. That's also a fork against his uh kang and his rook, and I guess he could play king fade and try to counter attack our rook and uh. What would be the simplest win here, and this is where we talk about, transforming the advantage right? Most people would be inclined to take on d7, but whenever there are two pieces hanging, you want to check what happens if you take one of the pieces queen takes eight eight. If you calculate with me, king takes e7 we're going to play this move. We can give a check on e1 and the king has to emerge out of its shell, because if he goes king f7 and I think that's what he might actually do uh, he allows no. He plays correctly, but now we take on a6, we hunt him down and again we transform the advantage if he offers us a queen troop king, king c5. Let's continue the king hunt. What should we do? How do we continue the king hunt? Can we give a check that further brings his king out of the shell? Let's go b4 check. Okay, and this is not rocket science. We could have also considered d4 check. Uh and king hunting is hard uh, but it's not like. I know something that you don't I'm just trying to find the right way to funnel the king in the right direction. If you will now, I'm gonna go c4 uh, threatening queen d5 checkmate uh, and if he gives us a check on a7, we can counter with check of our okay, queen e5 this checkmate um. I went quickly through that segment uh, just because there's no, no there's no rocket science. There, I'm just sort of bringing attackers in that was a nice game. Uh and- and this game really illustrates the concepts of transforming the advantage and purposeful development all in sort of one package, one more game, then we analyze, then we wrap up for today. It's already been six hours actually, so I'm getting really really tired, but one more game. I've got in me and this time he goes b6 we've already faced. G6 uh this time we're facing b6. Oh no board. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, our conception! From the last time somebody played g6 against us. What move did we discuss at length in that game? And that was the move h4? So, let's play h4, let's see what he does and I guarantee you that this is going to win us the game. He allows us to ram our pawn all the way up to h5, which is actually quite devastating, quite quite devastating, and what are we threatening uh once again, let us review by playing h5. Well, there is one thing we can do that I indicated earlier, which just uh h6 right. Exactly we just push harry down the board. The bishop has a very unenviable choice of retreat squares. You can go to f8 or we can go to f6, and both of these moves are just incredibly ugly. They both have their drawbacks. Once again, he has combined the two forbidden moves, e6 and g6, and by just simply developing eventually we're going to control all of these dark squares, and that is going to be the instrument of our domination. Now, here I'm going to actually on poisson, I want to keep the center a little bit open uh. Now you guys might be very surprised by this move right. Why are you giving up that e pawn, which was controlling f6 and part of the reason that I'm doing it is because the h6 pawn is already controlling enough dark squares? We don't need another pawn controlling the dark squares around blind skiing. We have one and that's enough, but let's continue expanding in the center. Let's continue ramming pawns up his throat, uh and creating weaknesses in his position. What move am I talking about here indirectly, I'm talking about the move d5 advancing the pawn opening up the center blah blah he's probably going to go e5, but when he goes e5 we re, we reassess the situation. We ask ourselves: okay, which new weak squares have been created as a consequence and the square that I'm really that catches. My eye is this square on c6? Can we try to get a piece there? Can we try to get a piece to the c6 square and we re? We can I mean it's a pretty simple idea. We can try. Let's give a check on b5, let's see what he does all right. There we go. We got a. We got a bishop to c6. Okay, he's taken, which is just basically harakiri because by taking on c6- and this is something a lot of beginners fail to do uh is- is, I understand the sort of positional ramifications of a trade right and he's going to well. He I was going to say, he's going to win the policy six, but he's actually not going to win the pawn on c6 because we are going to defend it. How are we going to defend it with the queen, okay, queen c7, and now it is time to look at tactics. How do we know to look for tactics here? Well, we've got a lead in development. He's got tons of weaknesses. We've talked about these situations before uh. This is just calling for tactics. Knight, b5 is going to be the move uh, because once he takes we're going to go knight, c7 check, we could have taken the queen first and then played knight c7, but I want to keep the queens on the board. This guy is actually very good. Uh he's playing a lot better than his rating uh, so kudos to him we're just gonna keep developing. Now we are going to extricate our queen from uh a8 we're going to slam it on d5, where it is sitting on a very nice outpost. He goes queen c6. Now we can trade queens, that's fine, but let's trade queens on our terms. What do I mean by that? Let's trade queens on our terms, what move keeps the tension, while also developing and while also uh, applying pressure on one of his weaknesses? That would be long castle exactly all right. Now, training is boring, but sometimes it's necessary and if he trades queens, you know be my guest. He allows our rook then to occupy this outpost. Pawn on d6 is hanging, and now it's clear that our plan should revolve around attacking that pawn on d6. How do we go about attacking that pawn on d6? What pieces do we use? It's clear that we'll need to use our knight. Where should we put our knight in order to exert pressure on d6 knight d2 is correct. I see a lot of people indicating this. Thank you nickelodeon for the thousand bits. This is a maneuver that people may see and think what is it? That's, a classic gm move. It's not really a gm move, it's very simple you're, just identifying the biggest weakness and thinking about how you can attack it. More purposefully and uh minor pieces are very good at that. Okay, he just leaves that pawn hanging so we're just gonna. Take it okay, great! I mean he trades and lets us activate our king. That's perfect, and don't forget about this pawn on h6 mark my words that pawn is going to be precisely the reason why we win the game other than the fact that we're up in exchange okay. So what remains in this position? Well, we need to activate all of our pieces, which means the stroke on h1 needs to be activated as efficiently as possible, and there is a perfect way of doing that. There's several. Can somebody give me an elegant way of activating the stroke we can actually rook yeah. We can do a rook lifts, uh, don't think of rook lifts as only things that happen in attacking middle games. We can lift a rook up in order to activate it. I mean nobody forbade us to do that. Yep there we go rook, c7 and um. We have a, and what did I tell you guys? I told you mark my words: we're going to use the h6 bond to win the game and I didn't know how we're going to do that. It did. I didn't know if it would be checkmate and the time has come to use the h6 pawn to win the game we can take on g6 and if he takes our pawn actually promotes, which is kind of ironic. We thought we might use the pawn to give checkmate, but we actually use this pawn to make a new queen out of it and that's why long-term weaknesses like a pawn on h6 are so hard to deal with because they're they're there forever uh and and they can transform themselves into so many different other advantages. All right. So we're going to win this game. The rest is very simple: we just use the queen to pick off as many pawns as possible and then we promote the resulting passers. Okay. Let's create a pass pawn, we already know from many uh many of these cases that the basic winning formula in such positions is to create a passpond as efficiently as possible and then to push it all the way to promotion. Okay, he's giving up the knight the rest is easy. We're just gonna push the spot up through to ga we're going to make a second queen and we're going to use the two queens to ladder checkmate. Okay, I mean I'm not actually a specialist in finding the fastest mate. Oh yeah. This is me okay, um, that was a nice game uh and- and he played very very well now this 13 move game. The only thing to point out is that uh, the accelerated dragon also offers a very good setup for people uh to play against almost any uh of these setups. That white may have right. You don't really need to change the way that you play with black now. This move, knight a2, is one that I wanted to explain. Why is the knight not getting trapped because we have the c3 square, and that is where the bishop comes into play? The bishop controls that square and white has no way of controlling it twice right um, so that was a very simple game and he flutters his rook and that's not the only time that the move knight a2, won a game for me on the 12th move. I actually had a game many years ago where the move knight a2 won me the game in 13 moves. Oh my god, that's a pretty eerie coincidence, so this game took 13 moves. Now, look at this game that I played many years ago over the board, richard newey against me in 2007 I was 2100 very similar opening. He played this bishop e2. He does this weird stuff with b4. He opens up the diagonal and now look at this knight on b4. I don't just drop it back to c6 tamely. Where do I put my knife boom knight a2 and he resigned because this knight essentially is the instrument of the knight on c3's demise yeah. So I was actually 11 when this game was played yeah but um yeah, so 13 moves and the move knight a2 was featured in it. That's a pretty interesting set in this other in this next game. He played the bird variation of the rye lopez forgot to play d6, so we play e5. We shatter his pawn structure, use the dark squared bishop to pick off the pawn and then slowly accumulate the pressure. This move, rookie 7, is where the party is at right. We're using the fact that this bishop on f6 is basically immobilized. It cannot move from this diagonal because of the possibility of checkmate and uh. The rest is is relatively straightforward. We want another pawn, we get the king out, we want to third pawn. We hung the fourth pawn and then we delivered checkmate um and in the last game we again successfully employed the move. H4 now, probably black should still play h5. This is the lesser evil uh, even though he does weaken t5. My guess- and this is actually a line- I mean people play this stuff with black. I don't like it personally and partially because of it you'll see me playing h4 against other gms right, I'm not trying to peddle stuff that that's somehow you know very dubious. I'm telling you stuff that I would do myself. Thank you, uh. Even that's very sweet, uh and uh it's great to be appreciated, so he allowed us to push the spawn all the way to h6 push harry up all the way to h6 and notice. What we're doing here, we're not we're not following up with g4 or anything like that. We're just developing our pieces, because the pawn on h6 is perfectly well defended. He's got no way to reinforce his attack on the h6 pawn and we play e5. We take the pawn we go d5. We continue to expand in the center, create weaknesses that he uh allows us to create more weaknesses from right. Now we go upon def queen to d5, uh and, and these weaknesses start multiplying, eventually transform transforming themselves into a tactic right. So this entire game was decided basically by weak squares, and these weak squares eventually allowed us to transform them into a direct tactical sequence. Okay, um can black also develop the knights f6 yeah. So that's something to consider, but the move e5 here would be quite problematic. That's why not having any of the central bonds out could be dangerous, because here black must again allow h5 if he tries knight h5 uh. Well, then the knight is on the rim, and that creates its own set of problems um. So so I'm not sure that this would be a long-term solution for black okay. So once yeah once the spawn reached h6, the funny thing is: if we fast forward all the way to the end. First of all, in the end game, if you want tips about the end game, piece activity is crucial. You want all of your pieces to be active, okay and if there's one piece that is not doing anything in the end game, that's a pretty bad sign! That's why we lifted the rook up all the way to c7. Then you look at pawns that may potentially become past pawns and you try to make a note of them right. This h6 pawn is far advanced far advanced pawns are important in the end game, because, with material being so limited, it is much harder simply mathematically speaking to stop pawns from promoting okay, and so that is why I found the mover of takes g6, because I realize that this pawn is two steps away from promotion. If we can dislodge this h7 pawn, then our pawn is going to promote and if he doesn't take on g6 well, then we are going to forcibly remove the h7 pawn and promote our own pawn after that uh, but but, but hopefully that was satisfactory for for now. I think I'm going to go now and sleep for a couple of hours so, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate uh and whoa man, I'm I'm getting bribed 500 bits by travman, curious chimpanzee with 100 bits, uh and another thousand bids by phineas, gage, uh and encore is called for uh. Given this incredible uh support that we've had today, um all right. Fine fine well, especially because people are continuing to bribe me smoke, brandon subbing, with switch prime. We have ob 68 with 100 bits, uh man, this hype train, has rocketed out of the station bologna bolognese at tier one. Another hundred bits by j root holy smokes all right. Let's get that game on the road. We are playing 1287 hmhk, all right, let's go c5 and let's get another uh sicilian and we've been playing the sicilian for the last couple of games, and now we play g6, I'm gonna disable the alerts just for this game. Thank you, drunky skunky, okay, so we already know that we're not afraid of him taking on c6, and can somebody remind me how did we decide to capture the last time and for what reason? Thank you for the 100 bits, modern algebra. What what is the the recapture that I like? Yes, so we played dc uh now I know most people want to capture toward the center, but we open up the bishop and we're gonna. Basically do the exact same thing: trapman gifting, five trav man, 9 25, 5, gifted subs. This is incredible now: where should this knight from g8 go? Can somebody illustrate for me the general plan that black has here and we literally had the same position a couple of games ago? So this is a perfect perfect way to cement our understanding. We play 97 and our idea is to push f5 and expand on the king's side, eventually transforming that into an attack on white's king first we're gonna castle. Okay, he's probably gonna play bishop okay, bishop g5. Now we don't want to play f5 immediately, let's first chase away the bishop and see where it goes. Okay. Well, he takes the knight great we'll just take back. We've got two bishops against two knights: that's a pretty damn good deal uh and we are ready to play f5. Let's go f5 he's, probably gonna. Take it and then we're gonna take back with the pawn and again the same litmus test that I recommended we can use here. Does he have a lot of pieces on the king's side? Not really right. He's got a lot of pieces clustered in the center, but they're all sort of awkward they're, not enough to constitute any real pressure on my center, because my own uh well, my own pieces are nicely clustered in the center, particularly the bishops uh, and you can see by the move, knight h2. That white is starting to fold over a little bit now. Where should we now continue our development? What should we do, and let's be calm here- no need for anything crazy. Let's just complete our development and that's kind of the theme of the first half of the speed run almost is, is you know, despite an unbalanced position, we just continue adhering to general principles. Some people are saying bishop d7, I'm going to develop it to e6. I feel like it's a little bit more active and the bishop from g7 is actually doing a great job, supporting that pawn on e5 f3. That is a very ugly move. Now, what exactly makes it ugly? Well, as we already know, the main thing that makes a move like f3 ugly, not to mention the knight on h2 being locked out, is the fact that it opens up this diagonal. The a7 g1 diagonal, to be exact and to show you guys the sort of algorithm of thinking we can actually make a semi-tactical move. That immediately exposes the uh sort of erroneousness. Of of this move, f3 the error behind we can play c4. This is actually a typical idea in these kinds of sicilian lines, although we don't always play c4, because this diagonal is weak and how do we follow up with this move queen c5, we can even play queen b4 by the way. Green b4 is also possible uh, but this is the the sort of the clinical way check. We will take the pawn back and because the position is open up. This benefits the bishops he uh is at risk of losing exchange and if he plays queen f2, which is the only way to save an exchange, why does it save the exchange uh because uh it it counter attacks our queen and if we take his queen, that the same rook that is being attacked takes our rook, but there's a very five head move here: okay and the concept that uh essentially brings that essentially brings this move out is what I call trading on our own terms, trading on our own terms. We want to find a move such that when he takes on c5. We make some sort of specific improvement to our positioning. Everybody finds bishop f8. I love to see it. Bishop f8 is what I had in mind. There were several other ways we could do that. We could have also slid our queen to b6. So then, when he takes it, we open up that a file for our rook. That would have also been a very interesting way to trade on our own terms. This is exactly what I mentioned when I said: keeping the tension. That is very hard to do. People are uncomfortable when they do it, but it reaps tremendous benefits if you do it properly now, what should we do here, because the window of opportunity for the queen trade has passed, but now we can take the queen, we take the queen, and how can we follow up? What should we do? What are the next two moves that we make here in order to fully activate all of our pieces, and I want a chorus of people saying this. Bishop c5 is right. First, first and foremost, we attack the rook, send it back so that the other bishop pins it and then we have one more piece to activate. That would be the rook and we are going to send that rook over to d2 to collect a bunch of the puns or perhaps just the knight. Now again, our opponent, okay, very good. Here's what I hate I hate. Looking at this bishop and saying this bishop is locked out. This bishop has to join in on the action. This is not fair. How? How do we make sure this bishop joins in on the yeah? Let's crash through his defenses, he doesn't have enough pieces to hold this measly wall this pawn on c4 in place. I suppose he can play rook c1 uh, but that would tie his rook down to the defense of the pawn now. This guy is again I'm playing some very underrated. Folks, let's get the rook to d2 and uh I'll concede to him that he has. He has succeeded in keeping my bishop out of this diagonal, but that's what makes bishops so strong, they're very resilient and they're able to reposition themselves very very quickly, so uh he's got knight, g3 he's attacking the pawn. How do we simultaneously defend the pawn and reposition our bishop to greener pastures? Where should we put that bishop we go? No f4 weakens a lot of squares, be very careful about the move. F4 f4 is very tempting. I understand that. But when you push a pawn, you always want to understand what weaknesses it creates. Now we go king f7 to stop a fork on f6. The bishop is going to reposition itself to e6 to keep the rook tied down. F4 is pretty useless because we just push the pawn with e4. His position has begun to crumble. Look at how, throughout the whole game, his knights are just stuck essentially on the h file, doing nothing. Let's complete our repositioning bishop e6. Now we have to ask ourselves: okay, what is going to be the subsequent plan of action? First of all, we can collect some of the hanging pawns right. We can take on a2, but I don't even want to take on it. I want to extend our domination completely and again the concept of trading on our own terms. How do we make sure that we trade on d2 on our own terms, there's two good possible ways of doing that? The first is rook eda, which a lot of people are suggesting. The second is what we are going to do, which is e3. This kills two birds with one stone simultaneously. We push our past pawn and we prepare to push it even further when we recapture our rook. This is something that we have to do with a granite. Okay, so rook here now look at this knight for a second. This knight is actually very vulnerable and we're going to attack it by playing rook g8, and if the knight moves then the g2 pawn is at risk of falling. He does have 92. However, okay goes in that f1, let's take on a2 and I'm going to accelerate the speed of my play a little bit because we're short of time, but the hard work has already been done, and now all that remains is the easy work he's played. Knight takes e3. What is the problem with this move? Nobody worry guys. I will win this game. I just want somebody to tell me what the issue of this move is. He blunders the knight on g3. The game is essentially over because now he's got to move the knight again and then the chain reaction basically starts. Okay. So now we take here look at how both rooks are hanging, so if he takes one rook, I take the other, and this is where the real daniel neridisky shows up and just give me a second guys. I want to make sure I don't lose on time, okay, so this is why I told you I will not flag- and I promise, for this reason. Okay, let's take off the mask, we've shown up to the party. This is checkmate uh, but in any case I I knew that it might seem like I'm cutting it close, but the reality is at that point. The position was already winning uh and- and that was a great game. I mean that was a very rich, very rich game, uh full of sort of interesting tension, okay, um! Maybe I should threaten to leave again we're almost 1300. That was our goal when we began this part of the speed run, and we are already at a level where we are beginning to play serious people, uh people who know what they're doing who have plans who don't blunder, often uh- and I know that for some of you- that's pretty exciting ones. Okay, um now just to quickly go over the game, basically the smooth dc. I want people to understand that things like capture toward the center right. Yes, that is a valuable principle and most of the time you should adhere to it, but here we're playing dc, because I want to open up the bishop and it's not that I really need another prawn in the center right. The movie five is plenty good enough. We have these two pawns exerting this bind over the d4 square, and now we execute the sort of traditional plan of playing f5 now if he plays a move such as rook add1, and I want to illustrate through the lens of this move, black's main idea, what does black do? Can somebody tell me what black's move is and what the long-term plan is. Those of you who play the king's indian should have a pretty easy time. Borrowing extrapolating that plan to this position, because the fundamental idea here is very much, I would say the same. We actually play. Thank you so much trav man, a huge shout out to that guy uh for a total of 70 gifted subs today, uh, incredible incredible stuff, and the support was absolutely unreal and also 5 500 bits. So that was awesome. Okay, the move is f4. We lock up the center. Why do we lock up the sub when we lock up the center? It becomes easier to attack on the side of the board. Now we're going to start attacking on the king side, we're going to do that by essentially just pushing up our pawns very slowly, very surely. That is why knights are just so bad they're, not able to make anything happen on the other side of the board, because we've put our pawns on squares such that he cannot open up the center and look at the pawn on c5. It is a trooper, it's stopping d4 and it's also controlling the b4 square, making it very hard for white to make any sort of counterplay on the other side of the board. Okay. So this is essentially what black's plan would be. I'm too tired right now to illustrate exactly how this would unfold, but hopefully people can fill in the blanks and in the in the game he played this move f3 and immediately. He weakens this diagonal we play c4 queen c5, bishop c4 and the rest is just very simple. There were two instances here of trading on our own terms. The first was this one: bishop f8 right. We want to simultaneously deploy our bishop and trap his rook. We don't just willy-nilly, take the queen. The second instance of trading on our own terms, look at b5: either we get our bishop back into the game or, as happened in the game, we tie his rook down to the defense of a measly pawn and then again in this position trading on our own terms. E3 right, take my rook, absolutely be my guest, but guess what there's a price debate for that? That price is that you get this pawn all the way to d2. Now we put bishop takes c4 rookie one and we take on f1. So that is how effective it is really to think about trading on different terms. Now we identify hanging pieces. We see that knight on g3 is undefended blah blah blah. We take the knight we take the knight again uh and and and look at this situation, where both rooks are hanging. If he takes one rook, we take the other one, that's actually a pretty common situation and the rest is essentially checkmate all right, so that was basically this game was a pretty well thought out game, and I think that that was a fitting encore uh to, I think, a really really good run. Of course, one could argue that we are within 17 points of 1300, so it would make sense to stick around and achieve 1300, but I think that everything must come to an end. We have to be patient. There will be more opportunities for the speedrun, so I think we had a productive session um sleep does sound like a very good option. Right now, uh. I might make my way to the couch and uh sleep to the tune of the tv but yeah uh again. The [Music] support today has been incredible. This is an epic stream uh and the last time I said this, we had another outboard of support, so I might never end up leaving, but I think this time I will actually go to sleep. So thank you guys so much that is always in. I always like to be bribed, but this time I'm going to going to sleep for sure it's 5 am. I need some shedding.
