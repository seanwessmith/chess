[Music] chess lebanese, salah 2120, let's go e4 and we are white again. I've been white in four games in our own. Speaking of the french he's done it, so I am going to play what I actually normally play against the french, which is called the tarash defense. I will talk about this move after the game and he takes on e4. That is the rubinstein french. It's. What andrew tang plays it's a very solid opening uh, it's not like that good and knight f6 is considered to be quite inaccurate and the reason why is because he has to ruin his pawn structure very early now, there's nothing that we need to do specifically here, we'll just develop our pieces, knight, f3 and, let's think about where we want this bishop to go. Where should we deploy this bishop? The move is bishop d3 and what we're going to try to do is root out this bishop on b7. This is his only strong piece. So, if you're thinking ahead, if you want to get rid of this bishop or at least contest it, what idea can you guys come up with that? May allow us to do that because his bishop can can get very annoying, particularly if I put castle and f w nietzsche and your quick queen e2 is the move. Not only are we insinuating well, we can play bishop a6, but mainly I was thinking of bishop e4 and um. Well, the question is sorry: can we play bishop a6, let's calculate a little bit bishop a6 if he takes, and then he takes on d4 who can visualize that position and tell me what move white has in that situation? Bishop a6 captures captures and then he captures on d4. That's a type 1 undefended piece which we can fork by playing queen a4. I will illustrate that, obviously after the game in the interest of time, I I have to make some moves, so we actually can trade the bishops, what happens if I do it anyway, at this level, you got to start questioning basic assumptions right and you got to start calculating variations more intensively. That's just part of the part of the process. You can't reason your way out of everything uh. Sometimes you need to just plunge in get your hands dirty and, and that becomes increasingly the case. The higher rated you get so he's gonna have to decide what to do about this trade uh. He can take the bishop, but that would get my queen to a nice spot. He could support the bishop on b7 and I would definitely take it and then I could potentially strike by playing d5 using the pin so we'll see what he what he decides to do he's thinking. No plenty of people mentioned queen eight four, oh crap. I saw this move now. He came up with a very clever idea: he's winning upon he's, switched up the move, order of what he's done and he wins upon. I did see this and why did we go for this anyway because look at his position? First, look at his king. His king is caught in the center. The board is wide open, so I made a judgment. Call that my compensation, what I have in exchange for the pawn here is going to be sufficiently weighted to warrant giving up upon. Maybe I'm wrong. That's a pretty risky judgment. Call to make, but a pond is not such a big deal to where we can never come back, even if this turns out to backfire. He can't he cannot castle right because we're stopped, even if he could, even if he finds a way to castle short, which is quite likely. His king is still going to be weak there and that's what the battle is going to revolve around okay um. What should we do here? How should we- and we should definitely yeah, so we should absolutely continue our development. We can do that in several different ways. We call it bishop, f4 or yeah- definitely followed by rook d1. That part is obvious um, but I actually like the idea of getting the bishop out to f4 a little bit of a more active square and if he goes bishop d6, I kind of like the standoff that happens between the bishops. I kind of like it, because that adds some spice to the position and the other thing which may look irrelevant is that if he ever castles short keeping the bishop on f4 will keep the avenue open for a potential rook lift. We had the bishop on e3 uh. We wouldn't have been able to lift the rook. It goes rook a rook to g8, potentially sort of pressuring this pawn okay. So this guy is very good, obviously uh and now we are going to go well, let's see! Well, let's go work. Do you want any? I don't see the danger yet he's going to go here and then we're going defend the pawn on g2 defend against checkmate. Okay, no, I don't believe we're in the range of my rating right now. Um. If you add a thousand points, then we won't be. So how should we defend this pawn without making additional weaknesses to our king side? So f3 is possible, but that opens up a diagonal. I actually kind of like f3, though uh, but that's yeah. Let's go bishop g3, let's uh, let's drop the bishop back intercepting his rook. Well, I've been sweating and I'm gonna lose eventually because I'm also talking through the games, which does you know it does make me a little bit slower. Now we need to lift our rook up in order again to add some some tobasco sauce here. There's two ideas with this move. The first is potentially to go to c3. The second, of course, is to double rooks using this main artery toward his king. So we're trying to do here is deploy all of our pieces and and get the attack started against black's king, which is now permanently stranded in the center, he's moved his rook, which means he's forfeited his right to castle. Aren't we just losing more puns? Well, we're sacrificing them right. I don't care about pawns here, I'm keeping my eyes on the prize uh, so we actually could play fg and open up the f file, but I'm gonna play hg here, because fg also creates some weaknesses in the range of our king and I wanna keep my king very safe. I don't wanna have to worry about that. Okay, rook g5 lifting up his own rook, that's an incredibly good move actually and um. What is he threatening here and what should we do about it? This is a a brilliant move, so he wants rook a5 trapping. Our queen, which means that we need to play a a move that that has that in mind, so let's go rook to f3 to evacuate or offer the queen in evacuation zone 2 to d3, for example, and then, let's see what he ends, rook c3 would have led to rook c5 again after we have a lot to discuss here and we'll look at some of the concrete variations after the game, um and um, okay, rook a5. Now, according to plan, we drop our queen to d3. We attack two pawns at once, but he's I think, he's foreseen this yeah. He has so now. Well, there's a couple things we can do right. First thing we need to ask ourselves: do have we deployed the rest of our pieces and the answer is no right. Uh rook to e1 would create the pin against the pawn on e6 deploying the last rook. I realize that I'm leaving all these pawns hanging for most of the game. There are tactical reasons why he can't really capture them and even if he could, if I sacrifice two more pawns, that's not really going to change the makeup of the situation, I'm going for checkmate here, um! So, let's, okay, we got to drop our queen and I keep tempting him into capturing more pawns uh, which I think is actually going to be good. For me. Let's see if he doesn't, he he's just incredibly good um extremely underrated, but I think he's legit. So we're gonna go queen g5 here involving the queen and trying to penetrate to g8. Okay, let's see what he does: okay, rook uh queen to d2. What should we do? How do we avoid the queen trade and if you give a check on g8, then you allow king e7. So what we can do is we can intercept good job nanuka. We can intercept the queen by playing rook to e3 and we're actually threatening something very devilish right now we have a quite a pretty threat and, let's see if he sees it, he does, which does not surprise me but um, just because I kind of talked smack about puns doesn't mean that we don't want to take them if they're lying around on the table and well here they are, we can take on h7 and that queen can swing back to h4 and continue the attack. We're just trying to continue poking and prodding and uh and hoping eventually that something will give attacking is is is, is an art, not a science, and now I'm going to deploy my queen to g, maybe come to c8. You know I'm trying to poke and pride get him low on time. That's all very viable! Okay, that's another very good move by him. Let's give it a check. Yeah he's outplaying me now, let's drop the queen back. The worst thing that we can do here is trade queens. That is the absolute last resort right. We don't want to trade queens, okay, so let's go check and if he goes queen f6 what we're gonna do and wow he spots that as well. So here just give me a moment. Let me focus yeah. This is my territory, but this guy is actually unbelievably strong, good shotgun, I'm winning yeah, so, okay, good game, um yeah. That guy was really good, really really good and um. I have to say yeah. His defense was absolutely stellar. Well yeah. At some point, I I have to step step up um and I don't think I was ever losing per se, but I I did not expect the attack to go as poorly as it did. So, let's deconstruct it and um and then we'll end there. Thank you for the hundred bits of lasagna yeah. Let me check I'm just curious very quickly. What yeah I'll check the percentages? Uh, probably uh. We I mean I played terribly but yeah, so it's um 90 for me to 88 for him um. So we both played pretty well, I mean yeah. Okay, a lot of people are underrated at this at this level. So anyways now knight f6, is not considered to be the best move now um knight d7 is is the best and uh now knight f6. So the reason is, you want to be able to recapture with the knight uh, not not the pawn or the queen, both of which contain uh their drawbacks right. If, if queen takes f6, then we saw this in one of our games right, we all of a sudden trap the queen with oh 1000 bits. Thank you innovative and the queen is no square, so that happened in an earlier game we played, but he took with a pawn which does have the benefit of opening up the g-file. We saw that he later exploited that oh fischer sub, your your chest lebanese saw nice. So basically, I guess the bishop a6 was wrong um and what should we have done instead in retrospect? If we wanted to defend this pawn, what should we have done? What should we have done, c3 right, creating the pawn chain and then patiently either bishop a6 or bishop b4? Now I saw this move uh and the idea is you interpose the move or remember if he would have taken here first and here? Second, we would have gone queen to a4 forking, the knight and the king, so he decides to take your first. Of course we cannot take the bishop because he takes the queen. Now he takes on a6 intermediate move and queen takes part, so I had to calculate it up to this position and concluded that, because his king is so stranded in the center um white white is in good shape, but I was wrong. I made the wrong judgment call and there was a very specific reason that I made the wrong judgment. Call my mistake and I'm learning from this. I I failed to notice one very specific thing. I overestimated the role of the d-file. I thought that I would be able to get a rook to d1 quickly and win the game. What did I miss? What did I not? What did I fail to sort of account for fully what defensive idea, not the counter play on the g file that wasn't dangerous. The idea of bishop d6 that bishop on d6 is solid as a rock and once he puts it there, it shuts off that main artery to his king and the fact that he's got bad pawns and the fact that he's in castle just isn't that important. So what I tried to do now is bring as many pieces into the game as possible and once the bishops were traded, that's just not something I anticipated. He brought his pieces out. The d file stopped being relevant. He started b. He started just controlling it now. One thing I wanted to point out right. At no point could he have taken the pawn with impunity queen takes c2 allows rook to c3, and now I take on c sub, uh and and he's under devastate. So I just wrote: g5 is the only way to preserve the advantage, that's a brilliant move, so I go rook f3 to evacuate. My queen rookie want to deploy my rook and here, although what black is two pawns up objectively, black is probably winning the king is still under some fire. Queen takes f5 by the way, looks tempting because the pawn can't take the game, but remember he's got a rook there. That's guarding that squad that spot okay, so queen g5, rook, fe3, of course uh avoiding the queen trade. Now. Could somebody spot my threat? I I had a very very pretty idea- and let's say he takes on a2 who can spy the tactical concept here: [Music] yeah, you guys all are all sharp rook takes e6 he's correct. Now we sacked the rope to open up the king of king d7. Then we win the queen and the rook if king f7, this is checkmate and if king f8, this is the nice part um it we're. Actually it's the mate is not that easy here, but we give a check another check and made on e6 kind of pretty line so typical sacrifice, but nonetheless uh salah was on on top of that and we won one of the pawns back. He got it back and eventually we got this kind of position where black's got three connected pass pawns, all of them extra extra, but I think salah in time pressure. He allowed some activity, so what should black have done? I think what black should have done here is try to trade pieces as quickly as possible. So in light of that, what move would you propose for black hair esteban gc thing for the sub or k1 yeah? It kills. It kills the play because the reality is black, can win with rook d1 here and just go for the checkmate. But even if you didn't do that, even if you drop the queen back, that's also fine, because you eliminate all the counter play, but in in time pressure he allowed queen f6 and now things get very complicated after rook. C3 are no longer worse. King c8 tucking, the king behind the pawn shell was the last chance to preserve a big advantage for black, but after king c6 I drive the king into the open and then I slice off the uh. You know the defense of the rook on c6 winning winning a full. Oh I missed made in one. Actually that's pretty funny. I I missed made in one with queen takes a seven. I basically pre-moved in my head. Queen takes c6. So not my best performance I'd say but uh not to take a single thing away from chess lebanese sally played like a monster um. He played like a monster and um he. You know he did a very good job fearlessly going for that position, which I'd evaluated as it's better for white but um. You know that was a key mistake and what what I take away from this game is not to you know, to spend longer evaluating the compensation. I think I have right try to recognize things like a square on d6 which would shut down the main source of counter play. Can I square rook 81 was preferred of her rook after one well, because now, if you go rook after one, I always advocate to think about the other rook. Now the rook on a1 is no prospect, whereas if you go rook 81, then this other rook could sit on e1 and x-ray the king um, why did you go bishop f4 instead of bishop? Well? By that point, I want him to play e5, because that pushes out a pawn that creates weaknesses and uh. That also creates a hook, and I could attack that hook by playing f4 in the future. So I want him to send forward his pawns um queen b7. But what is that? Really? I guess I should have done this, but he can go rook d8 and I wasn't in the mentality to like try to win back the pawn. I thought that I have sufficient compensation for it. Oh after this yeah, but queen b7, queen d5, at the very least, he's got forcing an end game or again you can go rook d8 and if you play queen c7, I guess he can capture and win back the pawn with rook c8. So to me this seemed a little bit too um to vanilla. Okay. So since your queen dominates the queen side, yeah but harvey the problem with, that was that it would be too slow right. That's that's a good idea in theory, but it's it's just not gonna work out, because the thing is one two. Three four I mean there's like five six moves and black has these ideas of opening up the g file? It's just not gonna, be not gonna. Be swift enough, if that makes sense: okay, but um by and large, that's how the game went good job to my opponent and our first 31 2100 and uh. He gave me a run for my money for sure here we go lemon, buffalo, okay, dolphin dobrin 357. So let's play an accelerated dragon: okay, so bishops, bishop f3. Oh sorry, bishop, c4 and knight f3 uh we've tackled this many times at a at a lower level. It's not as common at a 2000 level. Uh and basically we already know that black's main strategy is to prepare the move d5 now queen e2 is a very subtle move. He's preemptively, pinning the king, so d5 would would meet with e, takes d5 uh, and that would not be a good result because then I wouldn't be able to capture back because of the pit uh. But we shouldn't panic here and we should be very careful about playing bishop e7, because that would allow him to clamp down on us with e5. So, let's play d6 in order to take the sting out of e5 and now just continue developing. Normally that doesn't mean we won't play d5. We still might play d5 and it's okay to lose the tempo, because white hasn't placed his pieces in a very threatening way. So d5 here would be a very sensible move. In fact, we're gonna play it. No problem playing this move: uh e x c x. Thank you for the prime. Now what should we do? Who can tell me a good idea in this position? How should we go about playing this position? So knight a5 is possible. We can go after the bishop um. We could also go b5 and expand on the uh queen side, but I want to make a move that a lot of people would look at and kind of roll their eyes. I'm gonna play rookie a thank you jackie. Why am I playing rookie and I'm going to explain the the sort of the psychology behind this after the game, but the mover kid is sort of a general improving move, I'm kind of waiting for my opponent to to put his cards on the table before devising a strategy. Now here's the thing we ask ourselves what the drawback of the move c3 is, and what I'm seeing is that it weakens the d3 pawn, but can we get to that pawn well that pawn is on a light square? How can we deploy this bishop to aim ourselves at that point? Who can tell me very quickly before I make this move? Yeah b6, bishop a6, that's right, okay, knight, g5! I guess he wants knight h3. I guess we can chase that knight away. First, let's get it out of there and then play bishop a6 now if he goes okay, so he goes f3. What should we do now that this is already a very serious mistake? He doesn't fully appreciate the idea of our previous move, so we now have all of these sources of attack on the pawn. So all we have to do. No, not c4. Remember keep your eyes on the prize. Don't confuse uh, exploiting weakness with elimination actually helps him d. Take c4 is the is the move. This is a very instructive moment and now what should we take the pawn with the queen of the bishop? And this is a good example of not falling for general principles, but here prioritizing concreteness we take with the bishop uh, because we pin his queen to his rook. We win the exchange and upon our position is now winning, but we need to play swiftly and precisely to not let him back into the game. So we saw our plan worked. Like a charm. Bishop takes f1. Now after king takes f1 here's what I see the knight is a type 2 undefended piece, which means it's only defended by one other piece: that's the bishop. How can we use that factor to deploy and further activate some of our pieces, so knight e5 would be the obvious move, but what I like here is c4 in order to redeploy this bishop to c5, I think I've said deploy too many. Okay, this guy has completely fallen to pieces. Uh has completely fallen; no, he he plays like it he's he's not like provisional or anything he actually does. Does uh keep his rating. I don't know what what the deal is. I think he just panicked. Okay, so we're just going to trade bishops. Here we're going to complete our idea, bishop c5 and now I'm going to do something kind of fancy, which way would you guys take, which just out of curiosity, who thinks that they can decode what I want to do here? Okay, guys, we can move on from the fact that he's playing badly, there's, there's nothing. I can do about it pawn to open up the b file, love the mentality. Everybody is saying it now, no problem. How should we unpin ourselves? Rook edith c8, remember that the best way to solve a p pin is to defend the pinned piece with what I call the penny. You know, there's like the uh you in english, you add the double e uh to refer to something that's on the receiving end of something. So then the knight is the pinned piece and I found that there was no word for the rook, so I've developed this word penny. The work is the penny p. I n e e p, all right. Of course, the penny is okay. This is winning very exquisite. Yes, exquisite, the penny, pasta, yeah, I'm gonna, get the peanut paste and I'll see the that [Music]. Okay. I think this man can resign. This move had an idea. What is the idea of this move? Who can tell me? I didn't just play this move to screw around? What was the idea of this move? Stop knight before so you can play c4, bingo excellent. You guys are on top of things. Can we go rook c5? No, because of 97 great count. Of course we can we're still completely winning, but there is no need to give up and that's something I want to make very clear. I see a lot of people getting in trouble because of this now, even at a high level, I sometimes see people go up a lot of material and then they'll just start arbitrarily giving up material to trade more pieces, and that's fine. We've done that many times. I've emphasized the importance of that idea, but you don't want to take it too far. It's okay to give up a pawn uh if you're up a queen. It's a give up an exchange if you're up a rook, but only if it's necessary, you don't want to do that if it's not strictly necessary, because what often ends up happening is you're not left with that much extra material and you overestimate its value and I've seen people get in trouble because of that so um. I just wanted to emphasize that point. Okay, we can actually pre-move this. He has no way to defend against the checkmate unless he gives me this check yeah. Oh my god, I should have moved the rook. It doesn't matter. Okay, let's just prolongs the game. Yeah, I'm sorry! Only because he's not resigning uh! I have no problem with this, but okay. Finally, he resigns. Finally, he resigns. Okay, sorry that was the wrong game. Okay, so what happens here now? I've shown you guys why a move like bishop e7 is bad and I've even shown you guys the stem game where this was played and black got himself in very serious trouble to to remind you guys. There was a very beautiful game played by t ground petrossian, which served as kind of the classic illustration of why this particular structure is very bad now, conceptually the reason it's bad is black white. Is this clamp on the d6 square? Why does this clamp on the d6 square and that clamp is actually quite a bit more unpleasant than it appears? I froze my computer's frozen the game that really convinced people of how bad this type of thing is is petrosian against pacman. That was a different opening, but guess what black played here? What move did black play here? Black castles, and what did he allow? Who can tell me what move and castles was wrong? Black should have played d6. This will be familiar to us in a moment. Luneck bachmann was a gm, but he allowed e5. He didn't understand why this was bad. It is true that black breaks through the clamp with d6, but now black has all of these weaknesses that are remaining as a result of it. Petrosian goes after them and he won the game very easily and he wanted playing on these dark squares. It's very important to recognize this if you're a sicilian player, be very careful about allowing that that's why we played the move: d6, okay, so d6, bishop, e7, castles, castles and here d5. Now I want to make it very clear that some people would not play a move like this, because we've already played d6 and they wouldn't want to lose a tempo. Tempi are relative. Okay, a tempo is not does not have intrinsic value um and because our opponent is playing so passively, we can afford to spend another tempo on d5. You don't owe it to anybody to like try to be consistent in a certain way so c3. What is the drawback weakens the pawn? How do we exploit it? Deploying our bishop to a6 and, of course he played f3 now? What should he have done here? He probably should have played e5, honestly and and at least closed off the avenue to the pawn, and here you know we have a lot of things we can do. We can go b5 and and d4 or c4. I like black's position, but it's it's obviously very much a game and, of course, after f3 he gives up everything here and now. C4 right, exploiting the type 2 undefended piece knight a5, would have been a little less effective because of bishop c2. So, oh, why rookie yeah yeah yeah? I wrote this down. I even wrote this down. Why did I play rookie 8? What is the psychology now? Let me explain this from two angles now. First of all, what does rookie a do? What what exactly does this move accomplish? Well, it accomplishes a couple of things right: it x-rays the queen, so if he ever takes, you guys can see why the rook would be meaningful here. In addition, it creates the little f8 square for the bishop. That could be very helpful in a variety of positions or even the night. You know that could be helpful in a variety of positions and, above all else, I'm basically waiting for my opponent to show me how he's going to position his pieces. This is, what's called a healthy waiting move, it's a useful waiting move, but it still is kind of a waiting move and I didn't want to commit to a particular strategy. For example, if I'd gone b5, he had a nasty move, a4 cutting into my my little pawn majority on the queen side. So it's this sort of game of cat mouse, where I'm almost waiting for him to commit to a plan so that I can choose a plan in accordance with that. I think something like c4 was objectively, probably strongest, but I wanted to illustrate this concept to you guys. What's an unhealthy weighting move, h6 h6 would be an unhealthy waiting move because it would create a weakness on the king's side, a hook that my opponent can then use. It would, in effect, backfire by helping him make a plan. B6 yeah b6 would be fine, but I wouldn't really see a point in putting the bishop on a6 if this pawn weren't weak, okay, so yeah so e5, he could have done and that closes the position up. But now black can try to attack on the queen side, and I can position my bishop to f8 or even knight, f8 knight, g6. Does that make sense to everybody? So don't take this too far. Okay, you should only do this if you're quite sure that you have the time for this, you can afford it, but I think this was a good time to illustrate the concept of a healthy waiting move. Let's continue you.
