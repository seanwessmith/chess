[Music] okay game two cracker atm let's go e4 this time and i'm going to disable the alerts while i play the games if that makes sense because when i put this on youtube um when i put this on youtube people like it when there's like uh uh you know a specific kind of people like the flow i still this does not diminish my appreciation for the support and i'll re-enable them like after each game so he's playing the scandy he's playing the scandigo d4 and um basically the queen d6 line is legitimate that is a variation of the scandy that rose to prominence recently but the way that we play this isn't really substantively different from other scandies we just develop our pieces and control the center there's nothing crazy that we have to do here but um you know we have to be very careful because he's immediately applying pressure on the pawn what is his next move going to be and how should we deal with that move what is his what is his general scheme of development here so he's clearly applying pressure on the pawn which means what does he want to do he wants to go bishop g4 and the sort of russian school of chess move is what well d i'll explain d5 after the game but i'm a little bit worried that pawn will be insurable let's go h3 not a move i love to play but it really annoys the hell out of people ah now i can't put the bishop here and putting the bishop okay now he goes a6 but i didn't even really want to put the bishop on b5 where should we put the bishop where can we put the bishop now now that we've dealt successfully with his main idea we can develop actively and that involves a move like bishop c4 and now if we're thinking about pushing our pawn to d5 at some point it's easier to do that now we're just going to castle and where should this bishop go and we've been through this many times this is like the natural classic square we just bring our pieces into the game yeah black can play e5 yeah bishop g5 is right bishop e3 would be slightly more passive although a case could be made for that as well now um we're gonna make another well he wants to play rook d8 we still have to be very careful about protecting this pawn at the same time i'm not too worried about that what i am slightly worried about is the move b5 i don't want to let him go b5 with tempo and then fianchetto his bishop so how can we stop can we stop that we're we're kind of playing prophylactically this game trying to annoy him let's go a4 exactly this is a common move at like a gm level you'll see this all the time in various positions and if he goes rookie which i think he will yes he does um this is not a problem what we really want to accomplish here i've talked about this many times the best way to defend the pawn is with another pawn so it would be very nice if we could play c3 and freaking forget about this problem once and for all how can we go about doing that while not blundering the pawn in the first place yes we could go 92 this knight could re-maneuver to g3 a slightly more active square and as necessary we could play the move c3 okay so queen b4 is one of those moves that looks intimidating but i don't believe it really is because the reality is queen takes b2 is going to be you know it's going to be unthinkable so we can go bishop b3 but then he might go knight a5 and keep harassing us so let's see if we can defend this bishop with something can we kill both problems at once yeah we can just go b3 we can go b3 we don't have to even worry about queen takes b2 and if he goes knight a5 the bishop can drop to d3 and aim itself at the king so the queen on b4 is kind of stuck in no man's land we can take on e7 we can also drop the bishop to d2 either move is good let's take let's simplify a little bit leaving him with a bad bishop and now let's involve our rook and x-ray the queen discouraging him from playing e5 and we can then bring our knight out to g3 which we're gonna do and kind of complete the x-ray slightly better for white here he goes queen f6 where can this knight go from here where can this knight go from what would be a nice pathway for the knight who can tell me yep knight e4 excellent and white is slightly better here nothing extraordinary he plays he's playing well queen h6 and from here he could go to c5 but we shouldn't necessarily rush with that although that is very tempting so i'm gonna do it although he can go back to c8 here and uh he's doing fine but we're gonna start piling up on him what does it mean to pile up we need to look at the center we need to ask ourselves well are there squares that we can access in the center for our pieces what comes to mind what squares can we jump onto well he goes b6 so all right so that is interesting we could consider taking this funnel though i don't love that what we're gonna do instead let me think about this is let's drop the knight back to d3 so that we can go to e5 so notice i'm doing all these maneuvers it might seem mysterious what i'm essentially trying to do is optimize the placement of my pieces i'm trying to find the best central squares for my pieces and the move b6 is something that hopefully we're going to make him pay for he's creating these you know these weaknesses on the queen side and eventually one day hopefully we'll be able to exploit them now which knight do we want to put on e5 uh that depends on what he does although i like putting the f knight so that the queen has access to the king side squares in case we want to get started on an attack uh the perk of putting the other knight on e5 which is what we're gonna do here is that the bishop can then drop back to d3 which is what we're gonna do and aim itself once again at the king okay and now look his position is getting more passive oh and he's missed a very nice retreat for the night where can we go and what immediately do i think of when i play f6 is this the pawn on e6 look how weak it is so what we need to be doing is bringing the knight back with tempo his queen is almost trapped okay oh he goes here and now we can just take the pawn and once that pawn falls his whole position is going to start collapsing we are actually threatening something really really cool i'm anticipating this move i'm anticipating bishop f okay he goes f5 and he doesn't defend against it look very carefully at the queen it has no squares can we attack it yes we can g3 traps the queen the rook on e6 guardian d6 the knight's defending against the other squares he's gonna have to give his queen up for two pieces that's actually really cool so you can see the pressure rookie 4 he had d6 so that's why we put the rook on e6 not only to take the pawn but also to deprive the queen of that square all right so we put the pressure on okay so knight c3 we shouldn't panic gonna move like this we should ask ourselves oh so he finds a defense but the reality is he does it at a great cost to his position now if we were to move the queen he'd take the knight so let's take his queen and the funny thing is we now need to find a way to win the maximum amount of material so what should we do here what we should do is realize that both knights are hanging okay both knights are hanging what does that mean with my turn that means if we were to move this knight away then he would not be able to save both knights at once which is what we're going to do we're going to go knight g to e5 we're not going to take any of his knights because then he would take hours and attack the other knight and now we're going to win the knight and if he goes knight d5 which he's probably going to do we're going to pin that knight with bishop c4 now let's simply activate our pieces knight to g5 we're going to go for checkmate here even though it's an end game once again look at the amount of pieces that are next to his king this knight wants to go to e6 and then we're going to take g7 the game is basically over yeah so things are getting more complicated but we're following the same logic that we've always followed none of my moves should be like that mysterious so a move like bishop c4 involves some tactical vision he's put his knight on the same diagonal as his king so now we can do a bunch of different things we can go rook d7 yeah we're going to do that because the reality is if he takes on d7 then we take then we take on d5 and attack his rook on a8 so there's some tactics none of them are whole you know unbelievably difficult here for example what should we do here you know we should notice that the rook on a will be hanging if we take d5 what should we take d5 with and we should just take just safety five and bishop takes or rook takes would also be fine here we can take either rook it really doesn't matter i should play a little bit fast because i'm low on the clock and he resigns great game okay so he played the scandy and queen d6 has gotten quite popular lately even a book has been written about it and now h3 to stop bishop g4 uh we're just developing our pieces white is slightly better here a4 stopping b5 now knight e2 right a lot of people would look at this move and say and it's a retreating move i don't really want to retreat we're at the level when you can't think that superficially retreating moves can be perfectly fine and i've made that point for a very long time so we want to play c3 ultimately to permanently secure the pawn on d4 so this knight could get relieved of its duty and come to g3 okay so queen b4 now b3 if we had gone bishop b3 he goes knight a5 he attacks the bishop and if we move the bishop we have to deal with queen takes b2 that's kind of annoying okay so b3 knight d5 we take on e7 leaving him with kind of a passive bishop now we go rookie one x-raying his queen knight g3 94 knight c5 like just improving our pieces and now knight back to d3 so the reason we don't take his bishop is there's no need to do that our knight is good his bishop is bad that's a simple cost-benefit analysis and it helps him get his rooks to the d-file thank you jtm waffle um there's no other good square for the knight so again it's technically a retreating move but really it's not because we want to reroute the knight to e5 which is exactly what we do so he goes knight c7 we go knight d5 the reason i didn't play knight fv5 i i mentioned that we might play this move but the bishop is kind of stranded here and um i didn't want to leave it strandy it's like b5 idea is kind of nasty why didn't we take a6 so that is i wouldn't say that's a free pawn because let's approach this and like what is my intuition today what is my brain telling me my brain is telling me look this knight is stranded that should make sense to everybody the knight is no way back and what he can do is he can just defend the c7 pawn and guess what i don't want to deal with this just for a pawn like who knows if i'm going to get my knight out maybe i am i don't think he's going to win the night but this leads to complications that are not worth a pawn pawns are just like not that valuable in the grand scheme of things in the middle game and i didn't want to engage in this particularly in a blitz game and by the way as xcsme points out yeah bishop c it needs to be dealt with but we can take the knight and open up this evacuation route okay okay so nice d5 bishop e8 now we go bishop d3 aiming the bishop at the king and the move f6 is the decisive mistake um how did i immediately know what to look for well again i often mention formative games in my chess career where i committed mistakes similar to what my opponent does and there was a game that i have previously shared in the context of a funny story um but that game itself has instructed value i've made this very similar mistake myself okay it's not like i'm immune to this kind of stuff and my 2700 rated plus opponent failed to perceive this exact type of weakness okay so watch this i'm going to find this game and i'm going to show you it's my game against dimitri jakovenko who is a russian super grand master and i literally made i would say a very very similar slightly more complicated version of it but a very similar mistake yakovenko 2737. i've shared this game before 2015. so basically as as black here i was like i'm annoyed as hell at this knight i'm gonna chase the night away with f6 okay rebel thank you for the stuff and i failed to appreciate i failed to appreciate that um that i'm weakening the e6 pawn because in my mind i was ah the bishop's defending it but guess what the bishop it turns out is overloaded white has a very simple overloading tactic that my opponent also missed because it doesn't often occur at like the gm level people don't usually blunder this kind of stuff so what is white's move and people are going to see this very quickly the bishop is overloaded it has two jobs both of them are very weighty so knight takes c6 and let's say black plays rook takes c6 it doesn't matter and eventually you go queen takes e6 you've won a second pawn and you win the bishop and white is completely winning why does two pawns up black can win one of them but now after rook a2 everything is protected a6 is going to collapse black's pieces are scattered and black is just lost here it's not quite resignable but white would have won this my opponent after thinking for like five minutes goes knight back to d3 well it's not that simple but i'm sorry but like this is a game between the 2700 2600 everybody should follow at least the principle here so i've done this before the same exact type of mistake and i really want to emphasize that even though the close might be different the sort of type of mistake is exactly the same so be very careful about weakening those central pawns that's yeah we laughed our asses off exactly that's the ultimate goal here knight g4 rook takes c6 and now detecting the queen queen is trapped and we simply go g3 attacking it and trapping it okay what if he did f6 before 97. so if he did have six here then there was no way to win the pawn directly but it's okay i mean we could have gotten the queen e2 or i don't know rookie four okay childhood blender's a fork on c3 so uh we could have done something like this and and centralized the queen uh yeah he could have gone knight c3 and forced the exchange of queens but that exchange of queens is not necessarily horrible for me so i don't know there's details here but um the bottom line is the bottom line is this is like the the arc of the game how do we see that the queenest chapter well we've had games before we've had games before where we trap the queen sort of in the center of the board in the middle game and you should not exclude that possibility even if the queen may seem safe but i i can see that the queen is surrounded by a lot of traffic there's a lot of pieces in the vicinity of the queen no gm neroditsky coaching at gmail.com and that sort of alerts me to the possibility that the queen might be out of breath out of air and so g3 uh traps the queen okay so yeah it just looks trapped and rookie four doesn't trap the queen as some people asked because the queen has the d6 square although that's very close all right any questions or maybe may we move on to perhaps the final game of speedrun today as i said this is a bit of a short stream well bishop f7 doesn't actually oh yeah he goes knight c3 and here we just go 95 we transformed the advantage into winning a knight he found a way to get his queen saved but um he loses a piece in the end game and that's just a disaster oh yeah c5 sorry he could have gone c5 and opened this up i missed that yeah yeah yeah c5 or c6 i mean it's still miserable but you're you guys are right good job yeah c5 or c6 and the queen has evacuation squares on b and c7 but i can go c4 and dislodge one night from the other thank you wasted and wounded for the two months 2205 miguel tall okay that's a pretty intimidating name all right let's go with another let's go with the modern um and i played the modern increasingly just to show how these hyper modern openings are played thank you symphony and basically to reiterate what we're trying to do here is we are giving white control of the center yes we are but then we're using our pieces as snipers from a distance to chip away at that center and attack it with our pieces and then with our pawns at some point so that doesn't mean we don't need to complete our development we need to complete our development and he goes bishop c4 now bishop c4 as we've discussed on several occasions there is a small tactical idea here that um can allow us to liquidate and sort of simplify the position and actually equalize could somebody remind me of what that idea is and and you should think about this whenever there's a bishop on c4 knight on c3 those are the contours of this tactic knight takes c4 and then d5 winning back the piece okay so he goes bishop f7 that's an intermediate move people often play but it's not actually that good because it gives us the f-file and it gives us the two bishops however our king side is slightly weakened so that's the rationale behind it now this knight we need to be careful because this knight can go to g5 and cause us some problems we have a weak square on e6 so before we do anything crazy we need to take care of the passageway of this knight to g5 and e6 what move allows us to do that yeah now you guys might look at this move and say well aren't you weakening your king's side even further we kind of are but it's more important to prioritize stopping nitro5 than anything else right now and now we can continue our development so we can play we can play a lot of different things we can now play d5 actually control more of the center and get this knight out of e4 permanently if we do weaken the e5 square but we can control that square effectively by getting getting our knight out quickly and perhaps even at some point playing the move e5 to fully liquidate that weakness okay knight c5 is a really good move because his knight can swing back to d3 we don't need to play b6 here uh because that would actually help him we can actually just continue our development with knight c6 and uh then we can bring our queen out to add some more beef to the protection of the five square well this is beef this is like filet mignon that he just gave us and that's the thing you know when people are up against these unorthodox positions they tend to make more blunders which is why at this level i do recommend people to look into openings like the modern okay so queen d6 here falls into our plans and it protects g6 and now by the way we can go b6 and get the night out because the knight no longer has access to the d to the d3 square now we have an extra piece but let's not relax let's try to let's try to play precisely what does it mean to play precisely we haven't completed our development okay just to remind people of the importance of completing your development even when you're up a piece bishop f5 is a perfectly fine move we just got to be a little bit careful about a rook which is sort of stranded it does have the e4 square though but we just got to pay a little bit of attention to it it is defended now i'm looking at this knight on b3 and i'm saying we need to use our pawns to open up the queen side how do we do that we have a very very thematic maneuver here that knight on b3 is a sitting duck it's a sitting duck because we can advance our pawn to a4 if he plays a4 he weakens his queen side he does our bidding for us so and if he doesn't we can advance the pawn to a4 at least perhaps all the way to a3 get his knight back to a1 and induce more weaknesses and we can even lift the rook up through a5 to b5 so we do a million things with this one move well g4 would also blunder the knight or g3 would give the knight up but even if it didn't we have the e4 square okay now we need to be careful we need to you we need to put on our tactical hard hats we're on a construction zone we have several ways to capture this knight with the knight in the bishop i know most people are thinking you can't take with a knight but let's give that a try if we take with a knight and then he takes queen takes f4 i'm seeing that the queens have a standoff and at knight takes e5 queen f4 what move does black have there knight d3 check winning the queen how do you see that how do you even let your brain find that it's a mentality thing you've got to at least consider what happens if i do it anyway can i spend another 10 15 seconds on that key position he can take on d5 but a queen train is perfectly suitable to us we're up a piece and um if he doesn't trade queens then we've won another pawn we have preserved our dark squared bishop yeah okay he takes okay now we cannot take it after our bishops hey let's move the bishop we can move it to f6 we can move to d6 it really doesn't matter let's move it to f6 and keep it on the long diagonal and we still have the idea of going a4 a3 that's the point i've been trying to make at several points today is even though queens can be traded that doesn't mean you should forget about attacking um okay well let's think about this for a second if we go a4 his knight can position itself on d4 that's sort of annoying can we prevent preemptively his knight from coming to d4 without without ruining the bishop's control over the long diagonal yeah c5 how about this move and then once we play for the knight is to drop back in turn that will allow us to go a3 and shatter his entire queen side so these prophylactic moves are really the oil that makes the machine run we didn't have to play it we're up a piece but i'm trying to illustrate the general concept right of preemptively stopping retreating squares when you can afford it sometimes you can't afford to do that okay if he pushes b3 then he gives up the c3 pawn and more importantly his entire position is ruined so now we're going to oh now we're going to take we're going to start looking for tactics okay so let's gather the data here our bishop is hanging our bishop is hanging um so and our bishop actually doesn't have that many good squares but that's okay why is that okay because we have a lot of tactical concepts in this position that we can that we can rely on now rook before check a lot of people are seeing but then he's got knight b3 and amazingly he sort of survives there or so it seems but actually if we calculate a little bit further and we give this check his knight is now pinned the rook is not hanging because of the pin and there's no way for him to get to my bishop so we can just play c4 this is essentially a trade but it's a good trade because we preserve the attacking chances he takes our bishop we take his knight and then the c file gets open and we can use that c file to get to the c3 pawn if that makes sense i probably didn't find the best way to play it doesn't matter we're completely winning we can go rook c8 forcing his rook to a passive square and then we're going to be up a piece we've simplified the position and the rest is a matter of just picking up the hanging pawns so to speak okay yeah this isn't the best but i illustrated a nice concept i think and we're still completely winning so okay rookie three is good now what we're gonna do we're gonna go g5 we're going to isolate this weak pawn on f5 we're gonna just look around the board and turn the vacuum cleaner on i call this turning the vacuum cleaner on we're just picking up his weak pawns what are his weak pawns that we can get to what are the pawns that we can like get to here there are two that i'm thinking of the first is the f5 pawn which we just created the second is the h fun and we can swing the rook around and win the h-bun remember that the ultimate idea in such end games is to create a past fun so from that perspective taking this pawn is good because then we can start pushing the h-bot and i'm actually ignoring this deliberately and i'm even ignoring a check on h2 because this pawn is going to go so fast and you guys will see that he simply has doesn't have the firepower to stop it watch watch how quickly this pawn just runs to infinity right exactly so now we're just going to get our rook back and then run this punt up the board i don't care about anything else all i'm going to look for is whether he threatens my rook you got to be careful you don't want to be too cavalier about these positions here he's not going to be able to stop it whoa look who's here gm hikaru thank you five gifted from the man himself ikaru thank you i really appreciate it uh wow i think he's got a thing or two to learn from the speedrun you know after all i don't think he's fully grasped some of these concepts uh you know and uh thank you thank you car really appreciate that thank you youtube congratulations that was well done and uh i really appreciate that okay uh so what is our goal in this position our goal is to get his king onto a square where we can where we can check it with the rook if we if we were to move our rook right now anywhere he would simply take on h2 so we need to use tactics to draw his king to a checkable square and that square would be c3 so we notice the square on c3 we capture twice and now we've gotten the king onto a checkable square such that we can now promote to a queen check yeah we can fossilize him here check i'll take the juicer and now the mate is very simple we just ladder check made him on h3 right good game and um yeah i'm gonna slow this down for the sake of you know certain gm's who might not understand the pace okay um basically this was a modern which we play and um we took on e4 which is the common tactic in these positions i've talked about this before when you see this and you see a knight on f6 you should connect the dots and play knight takes e4 to break into his center um and the best way of dealing with this in my opinion how can white deal with this to preserve his bishop and not give up a pawn like what is the sort of move that is often played in these positions well the perk starts with d6 it's actually very often transposes into each other bishop d3 and now you take on e4 and now we can go after this pawn we can go knight d7 and c5 and attack the pawn thank you justin hykus and black basically liquidates white's center black is doing very much fine here that is why knight e4 is good but he decided to take on f7 okay and um that's the reason we played h6 is to prevent his knight from accessing the g5 square that would not have been that dangerous so this is an example of where i as a gm might have played differently right i might have just developed my knight or developed my bishop but i want to illustrate this concept of playing prophylactically to you guys right so d5 knight g5 and what can happen here is that he gets his knight to e6 and he forces us to give up our light squad bishop and this leads to a host of unpleasant consequences uh does that make sense so that's why we start with h6 we deprive the knight of the square and only after he goes c3 do we go d5 and the knight has to go to an inferior square then g5 so knight c6 now we develop and he blunders his bishop here after this everything was very obvious he probably should have done this first this would have made bishop f4 possible and can somebody remind me what did we plan to do against this move or against many other moves thank you spencer lux for let's hear one so not g5 because that would create too many weaknesses on the king side right mr llama it does you're right but the reality is here well it also it all hinges on us finding the next move knight g5 comes with tempo it attacks the rook it makes us lose time that time allows him to increase his control over e6 so the move ladies and gentlemen is queen to d6 we are doing two things first of all we are we are bringing the e5 square under control and second of all we are stopping bishop f4 why are we stopping bishop before because we can take earning us two pieces for a rook which is very good for black okay the logic should be pretty simple here um queen to d6 and also we're potentially preparing e5 which would liquidate us from the weakness so at this level it all kind of depends on tempe and concreteness right the concept can be correct but the execution can be wrong thank you spiro man for the tier one but he blunders the bishop and now everything is very simple we bring our pieces in and now knight takes c5 was like the key move thank you dragon x if queen takes f4 then knight d3 check with a discovered track and winning the queen well jockeys if you consider the material sort of if you literally consider the math uh usually bishops and knights are considered three points each and a rook is considered five points with six against five but that doesn't tell the whole story in the middle game two pieces for a rook is usually good for the two pieces in the end game there could be a confounding factor a rook and this is something people should remember when you have no other pieces on the board a rook is often very much superior to two pieces uh because rooks are more mobile and they could go around vacuuming up pawns it can be much harder for the bishop and the knight for example to coordinate in time to prevent the rook from you know running amok and taking pawns and supporting passers so if you have an endgame you need to be careful if you have a middle game two pieces usually better than a rook okay so the really only interesting moment of this game which i didn't fully explain i think is here so c5 right we want to play a4 and the logic that you should be using right when you're considering a move can i play move x and you say well where can my opponent move his piece knight d4 yeah we can trade but i'm trying to illustrate the concept here can we take that square away from him first yes we can c5 and then we want to play a4 how can i determine whether a trade is good for me or not well i mean look i can't give you an algorithm what i'm trying to do here is show you how i do these kinds of things in the game but um basically at the bottom line you you want to weigh whether your piece is better than your opponent's piece and i think this bishop is on the long diagonal it can support an attack and i don't really want to give it up unless i have to i ended up giving up the other bishop and it is precisely the dark square bishop which ultimately won me the game this bishop was responsible yeah i think i'm going too fast for hikaru he i don't think he's he's following this uh rook takes c3 the reason this works is because the bishop controls the c3 square does that make sense
