okay i get a challenge from a 2100 let's play them hb pencil one all right let's play hb pencil one 2094. that's a good rating okay so let's play a french i've been getting some requests to play a french i'm going to do that and um in the french there's two main lines you can play the winner but should be four attacking the knight on c3 which is defending the pawn but the move that i prefer to play the move that i actually have played is just knight to f6 attacking the pawn now white has several moves here yeah so bishop g5 is one of them now you take on e4 that's the main line and basically you get this very interesting structure where okay bishop b7 developing the bishops cutting into the pin uh the main move here is bishop takes f6 basically it's this principle here is the same gtx f6 as in the modern where we give white better control of the center but in return we get several things this pawn structure is very easy to misunderstand it looks bad but remember what i always say when we have several pawns masked together in the center that can actually be a good thing we have that f5 in our pocket but we don't want to play f5 yet um we want to find a good place for this bishop i'll explain everything after the game we could take with the bishop that's also possible where should this bishop go and definitely not to d7 that just seems really awkward yeah we should definitely fianchetto the bishop this is a perfect place to do it then at some point we're going to go f5 our bottom line idea here with black is to put pressure on the d-pawn we can actually do that by castling long where we probably will castle on because castling short here it's not that it's unthinkable it's actually possible in certain positions but uh when we can't guess along we definitely should okay yeah f5 would weaken e5 we should definitely factor that into our calculus here now so what what kind of moves can we play here what should we do how should we go about playing this so there's a move that we can make that is not a developing move per se yeah so knight c6 is possible but we have to be very careful about essential strike like d5 now the first thing we're gonna do here nobody has suggested this move yet look at the g file for a second um i am a big fan of developing flexibly so not revealing entirely what i want to do yet and a way of doing that would be rook ga let's actually make sure that white castles and if white castles then it's i would say easier for us to develop in a way that would be more conducive to attacking on the king side if white goes g3 well then he weakens the long diagonal and then i'm going to show you guys the best way of developing here it's going to blow people's mind but there is actually a logic to it the best move the best way that i've learned to develop my pieces here is actually to play c6 i'm going to play this move now and i'm going to explain it after the game but basically the idea is this if you were to go knight d7 what would you allow what move would be very nasty in that position yeah i know c6 looks terrible but if we go knight d7 we allow him to break through with d5 that is not pleasant at all so c6 temporarily stops him from going d5 now we can go knight d7 and we've opened up a little window for the queen on c7 now i know what you guys are thinking aren't we blocking the bishop like isn't that doesn't that violate the most basic rule it does but this is a this is a dynamic factor because at the end of the day we are probably going to play c5 and unlock that bishop once again this is a temporary measure that we're taking to prevent d5 until we are ready to reopen the board with c5 there's nothing so in other words the bishop has a lot of potential energy now he's attacking the pawn what would be a good way to defend against that pawn and i've mentioned this move before yeah the move is f5 notice that the knight on d7 also guards the e5 square so he can't put a knight there we can also improve the position of our dark squared bishop by putting it on the long diagonal and basically fulfilling our ultimate goal which is to attack decor let's actually do that bishop a6 here is possible but it's not that scary and against bishop a6 we have a really interesting idea now let's take a look at this knight for a second very carefully if we go c5 here he can still go d5 this knight on d7 is sort of stumbling in our way and there is a way that we can improve that knight it's a particular type of maneuver it's not like b8 the knight would be super passive well the knight is bad because it's sort of blocking the rook the move is actually b5 and we pave the way for the knight to come to b6 and potentially we can push the pawn with b4 and that could be very unpleasant now aren't we weakening our king well we are but as i've said many times what you need to understand here is that white isn't doesn't have the firepower necessary to really exploit this weakness look at how many pieces are next to our king it's really not a problem um it's it's not something that you should be worried about uh when you when you understand how many pieces there are next to the king and the fact that white really can attack okay that he just made a big mistake he missed a particular move what did he miss the opening was a french so rook g4 is creative but let's take a look at this knight for a second this knight actually has no squares so we can trap the knight with before this literally just traps the knight and when i played b5 the way that i saw this is i sort of noticed that b4 was a general possibility and so that means you have to test it at least for a couple seconds on every move this wins the knight that is a nice little french french game here and uh yeah he's busted here he is busted 94. we take it he's given up tonight for what he can now he's attacking this pawn let's go h5 independent we also create a stronghold for the rook on g4 we can involve the rook that way and the rook will be able to attack the d4 pawn although that's not necessarily mandatory we can also just double the rooks which i kind of prefer i kind of prefer the idea of doubling the rooks playing more centrally and the rook from d5 okay so what do we do here that was a mistake we need to be very attentive to how the position has changed so he's getting his knight to b3 we need to stop him from doing that and if we are attentive well rook g4 is not necessary we can just straight away take i think he's watching my stream he just said rook takes d4 no you're definitely not stupid for struggling to get 800 that is far from easy okay and and we're we just trade rooks actually if we want to be fancy here oh we have a sexy winning move here now what am i noticing here i've said many times what is the worst defender of any other piece the queen the queen is the worst defender of any other piece queen is defending the rook queens are very easy to distract and we distract the queen by going queen e5 if he takes the queen and we first take the rook with check he covers it with his knight and then we take his queen if he doesn't we are also threatening checkpoint he's busted immediately if he gives us a distraction a distraction check on 85 we can just move the king actually um so that was a nice game so that was um kind of complex this is why i don't recommend the french to to certain players i feel like you know i feel like there's a lot of structural new structural things that you have to understand about it in order to play it effectively and that's just not always easy to do on on demand now knight c3 is the main line knight f6 is the steiner's variation of the classical variation bishop b4 is the win hour which is the more most popular move um this is fine like this is a decent move this is the main move but the way i learned it is with knight f6 now e5 is the main move along with bishop g5 and basically this creates a pawn chain the idea of going knight f6 is that the knight is on c3 it's blocking the move c3 which means that c5 is going to be particularly strong undermining the base of the pawn chain and the main line continues f4 protecting it from the other side and basically the battle much like in the advanced french revolves around whether we're going to be able to get to that pawn on d4 this should make sense to me to you guys hey good game man thanks for being the stream that was that was great so he plays bishop g5 how do you deal with queen g4 i'm not sure in which position well if they push g5 right away that's called the advanced french um that is what i have played with white and c5 c3 knight c6 it's like the same type of position our moves are going to be geared toward trying to get rid of that d4 pawn to make white's pawn chain collapse that's really all there is to it there's a lot of theory there okay now f6 would be a thematic mistake these moves are possible on the french but we're attacking the tip of the pawn chain and normally as we know we want to attack the base of the punch and that's just like the main thing you want to you want to do okay um i hope that makes sense all right looks like it does make sense i don't want to bog ourselves down too much with the opening theory so it takes takes bishop b7 bishop takes f6 now why didn't i take bishop takes outside so like the reason this is a move but gtx f6 has a lot of these hidden benefits like we get the g file open for ourselves and we can potentially play f5 and pave the way for the bishop to come to f6 if we play bishop takes f6 then he can first of all take the bishop and really simplify the position we don't necessarily want that we actually keep the two bishop advantage by taking the pawn so there are these complicating factors and the fact that the pawn structure is kind of weak is yes that's a detriment to this but it's not the only disadvantage so knight f3 b6 right bishop d7 is super passive and it allows this very very nasty pawn breakthrough so we want to prevent that bishop b7 rock g8 forcing him to weaken his position or reveal the fact that he castles i think rook g1 is inaccurate i do think white should castle i think white should castle um even though later on i mean we can use the fact that i'm pressuring g2 i do think that's the best this is absolutely i've played this over the board this is the main line i think in classical games bishop e2 is considered inaccurate um there's other ways of playing this for example g3 here is a good move and the idea is to deploy the bishop to the long diagonal if black does the same what does white have in this position yeah if he takes for the knight then we take him to the bishop i'm sorry i had to get a bite of chocolate that's the thing and um there's a lot of theory here so rook g8 rook 21c6 now this is the key move i want people to so somebody asked can't white play d5 anyone will know he can't because we just take it we've got two defenders on the pawn and two attackers which means he cannot take yeah we can play bishop a6 but the bishop is actually a good piece we don't actually want to trade it even though we can so rook g and rook g1c6 now i explained the logic during the game but just to recap we fact one we need to develop tonight that should not be a surprise to anybody we need to develop the knight we need to complete our development we also have to castle at some point we can't keep our king in the center forever he's ultimately going to go d5 and we have two three ways of developing the knight and all three of them allow d5 knight c6 allows d5 because it obstructs the bishop and i wanted to make sense to everybody why allowing d5 is nasty the reason allowing t5 is nasty is because we have a deficient pawn structure which means our king is weaker which means we don't want to let him open up the center just yet until at least at least until we castle so knight c6 allows d5 knight d7 also allows d5 because it obstructs the queen and uh you know in contrast to the other position we can't take white's queen this is very very bad for us um so that's as i explained what makes it so good for white because the fact of the matter is our pawn structure near our king is worse than whites so when he opens up the center he exploits and he sort of magnifies the problems created in our pawn structure that's why we want to keep the center closed yes you can go e5 but now white's carved out some weak squares y can go here and then here we've created a very big weakness on the f5 score we've also blunted the bishop white can also go here right and put a bishop on f5 creates outposts for his pieces we don't really want to do that a c6 you guys will see is a very thematic move in the french in these positions i can show you many games where this move has been played um queen queen d2 97 the other benefit of c6 is that we find nice ways to develop our knight and queen thank you zinc right we go queen c7 our queen isn't in the way king b1 castle and now we're basically ready to play c5 uh we don't actually have to rush with this move uh and we didn't in the game but um we are ready to play this should the occasion present itself so c5 here would be already something we could think about because here i would notice that the rook x-rays the queen which means we could move the knight out of the way the pawn would be in trouble i'm not saying this is like the best thing we could do black could continue to prepare c5 black can also do b5 and knight b6 and that also is the idea we applied in the game also very typical so that would also be a possibility well e5 here would not open the bishop so he could ignore this and also i remind you that this creates a weakness on the f5 square which is not the end of the world but we don't necessarily just want to create weaknesses for free thank you kryptonite 64 for the prime okay so i've studied these positions so i kind of know these ideas so f5 f5 would be perfectly good bishop f6 improving the bishop here for example c5 would allow d5 again and we can't take because the bishop hangs and also he's moved the queen away from away from the pin away from the x-ray of the rook so bishop a6 is fine now we go b5 thank you b go 97 appreciate the prime and um the idea behind b5 is to improve the positioning of our knight and to begin the attack against this king why is the knight bad on d7 because it blocks the rook and because on b6 it can potentially jump to c4 which is a really really nice square so g3 knight b6 and now the decisive mistake blundering the knight what should white have done here several possible moves maybe rook d3 um and then vacate the d1 square not ideal but at least this doesn't lose the knight you could also go a3 but that would create a hook and that would create a hook which we could exploit by going a5 b4 that would not be my favorite move i think white is slightly worse here i i don't like white's position particularly but uh you could also go queen e3 and open up the e2 square for the night although knight c4 now is possible so you guys can see how unpleasant things have become here um i think that white made a series of inaccuracies uh that led to a nasty position so that would be my my suggestion g3 knight b6 rookie one b4 winning the knight h5 depending upon doubling rooks just taking the pawn and now the simple queen e5 wins the game because we're threatening checkmate we're threatening the queen and if he takes rook takes d1 as an intermediate move we take the queen we're up or we're going to work on a knight so you know that's why these structures are unique it's not impossible to understand the motivations behind a move like this but it's hard to find this if you've never seen this move before it's very unintuitive to to close down your bishop like this uh with the fore knowledge that ultimately you're going to open it back up again the other thing and i've made this point many times but at this higher level it's okay to have one of your pieces be passive for a certain period of time um because black has such a solid central pawn structure you don't actually need this bishop to be super active yet that's not a necessity a white's pieces aren't that active either like white's bishop isn't that active like dirk is passive then i don't c3 isn't doing much so it's okay even for 10 15 moves for your bishop on b7 to be not the strongest piece in the world that comes back to a point i've always made so that not every one of your pieces has to be curing covet or distributing the vaccine at any given moment it's okay for a piece to be doing something like working inside of the machine you know getting the the machinery to run from inside of an office building rather than from you know a place where everybody can tell that it's good if that makes sense well c6 let's see if the computer likes it yeah so c6 is not necessarily the best according to the computer but i think it's quite decent um i actually think if we let the computer think here it'll it'll appreciate c6 and um yeah it's very complex like at this level you need to find ideas like these to make stuff work uh but the logic isn't unrealistic i've explained every step of the logic but it's just hard to get yourself to play this that's just the reality of chess at like a 2300 level um your pieces are cramped you're not attacking anything directly but that's temporary that is entirely temporary um eventually once i open stuff up his position is going to collapse really fast it's one of those lines where you do stuff for a long time you're not attacking anything but then when the position actually opens up you know you make everything up you you all of a sudden your pieces become really active hey gary um the computer actually at a very low depth it says knight c6 i'm not sure why it's not worried about this oh it's saying knight before okay this was interesting actually couldn't white have exploited the fact that i'm undeveloped well white is not developed either white is not developed either uh so it's not like if i had a queen here and white had a rook here yeah that would be different but uh i'm i'm developing very fast to castle queenside so white just doesn't have the the power to exploit that if that makes sense this is also theory like it's theory and i i know that and so i know that this is legitimate right even if i did a rook on g7 it would not be easy to to do anything it's very hard to give checkmate in general let's play dm 85 and let's go d4 um so it's time for us to branch out a little bit i'm going to play the java london which i play at my own level and i'm going to give you guys a little run through as to the main ideas of this opening i i know that whoa gary 500 inc thanks gary okay now basically we're just developing pieces now we go e3 we support the d4 pawn we do not take on c5 and i'll explain why after the game and this is already a mistake this is already a very big mistake that is one of the appeals of playing the jibaba you guys can see that good players fall into this trap knight b5 and there's no good defense against knight c7 there is no good defense against knight c7 short of moving the king out which is probably the best move honestly but pretty disastrous on its own and um e5 here intercepts the bishop but it drops upon i've shown this line before and um i would caution people that is the reason i haven't played this before i would caution people to do this stuff solely for the sake of getting your opponent to fall into traps and he actually plays this the best way he actually plays this the best way now a6 attacks our knight counter attacks are made now the reason that we don't want to play e takes f6 if we calculate here ef6 a b5 and then if we if we play bishop b5 we fall into queen a5 check which wins the bishop now knight d6 check he would take on d6 and then the pawn on d6 that would result would be weak so what is the simplest move here we don't have to overthink it just play it simple the pawn on d5 is weak so if we operate from that perspective we can just go knight back to c3 just go knight back to c3 we're now attacking his knight if he moves his knight he drops the d5 pawn he's gonna be two pawns down although it's not as simple as that um because we need to watch our own position d4 okay now um let me think about do we want to play ed first no we don't let's just take take his queen now what would be the simplest move here and we don't want to rush we need to develop a tempo very very typical way yeah developing with tempo castle long check and now we are going to be up a full healthy pawn in the end game let's take here now the reason we didn't play fg is because that would help him develop right we don't want to help our opponent develop his pieces now we have a simple end game we are upon up but we need to be very precise this is not going to be easy to win um especially against a very strong opponent like dm 85 now how should we go about developing here who can propose a a move here now basically like what we need to realize here we need to do a couple of things we need to figure out okay where does our opponent want to put his pieces and this bishop on c8 he wants to get it to e6 and target the a2 pawn so let's start with a move bishop c4 but if he goes bishop e6 there's a five head move that we can play he probably is going to go bishop e6 now we don't want to take his bishop we don't want to take his bishop because that would help him correct his pawn structure if we play bishop b3 we got our bishop trapped but we can go bishop d5 and if he attacks the bishop we can support it by pushing these one of one of these pawns he takes on d5 we get our rook to a really really nice central location so bishop b3 is the right idea but the wrong execution the rook g8 no problem so he's attacking the spawn we can we can just defend it we can go g3 it's an awkward looking move but remember that he can't attack this bishop so the fact that this bishop is sort of trapped is not a bad thing um there's no way to attack it and um in fact the bishop is now very well protected there's something that looks wrong with this move but there actually isn't anything as far as i know um rook t8 so we can play c4 or we can play e4 uh both moves have a case that can be made for them um i do like c4 the the potential issue was actually no i do like c4 actually i do i do like c4 well there actually is an issue with c4 and i did miss a move here but that's okay i think we have a response to that move uh the problem with this move is i did not actually practice what i preach i didn't understand which squares this move leaves behind let's see if equal b5 i thought about but but it drops the knight that that i did think about we should have got e4 though e4 was better and yeah he find knight before so he attacks the bishop now let's prioritize here if we move the bishop if we move the bishop then he plays knight takes a2 check disattaching the king from the rook so it's a lot more important to preserve the bishop than to defend this pawn which means we should go e4 we should go e4 it's yes we give up the pawn but that's okay because we still have a monster bishop he's playing extremely well now we should develop our knight and connect our rook so we don't have to worry about the stuff anymore now we potentially are threatening to take on b7 although f5 would be a super super strong move here let's see if he finds it oh but then we can maybe still take on b7 f5 we can actually take on v7 and that gets a little complicated but his king is weaker than ours so i think that should pay off in the end yeah that was an inaccuracy by me but you know i make these mistakes all the time it's okay um i should have done e4 first and the pawn on c3 would have guarded before that's why it's so important at this level to when you whenever you move a pawn you allocate three four seconds three four five seconds to understanding okay what squares am i leaving behind can he occupy those squares flyer 10 hello now we need a plan we need a plan there is a very typical plan in such positions right we have a file on which most of the action is happening that's the d file so logically speaking what can we do to emphasize our control over the file and knight c3 is good as well we can improve the knight but let's double rooks double the rooks that should be a plan that's not surprising to anyone that is the classic way of exploiting our control over a file here's how you should okay so 95 should we take the knight should we take the knight and don't say no just because i'm yeah we should i got you guys i know a lot of people will say no because on on like tests and stuff yeah why not we take the night look at how lame his bishop is just staring at all these pawns look how lame his bishop is now we get to double we win a tempo guess what that's as good as it gets ladies and gentlemen that's as good as it gets and um goes bishop e7 i baited you guys now we can play several different types of moves uh this knight on on e2 let's improve the knight let's get the knight to a civilized square potentially we can get it to d5 but let's not rush because if we take the bishop on e6 why is it well this should be seven he's got rook b8 winning winning the the the bishop so let's prepare bishop takes b7 actually let's let's go h4 first let's expand a little bit on the king side let's deprive the bishop of the g5 square and we are preparing a particular move here yeah we want to move the king i want to move it to c1 but if i moved it to c1 immediately he would have this check that would send me right back so we go h4 to take away the g5 square from the bishop in preparation for kingston now a lot of you might be asking well why the hell didn't we just move the king to the a file well it wasn't that easy i didn't want to move the king to the eightfold because it's an endgame and in end games you know it's not a great idea to move the king away from the center and i want to keep the king relevant that's basically the bottom line now we're kind of threatening bishop takes b7 although it really depends on what he does yeah we want to make sure our king is active in fact we can bring the king all the way to e3 that might be a good idea if he does find a way to defend the pawn yeah there's a lot going on here i'm not explaining everything but um i think you guys are getting the gist of what i'm doing white is better here it's a very hard position to play okay so bishop g4 i know what all of you guys are thinking we should play f3 but this is actually a really clever move if we go f3 he drops his bishop back to c8 and guess what happens the pawn on g3 becomes extremely weak and his rook attacks and then if we go g4 he wins the pawn on h4 so let's just move our rook up let's not let's not make any reactionary moves these are moves that a lot of people struggle with a move like rook t2 is not an intuitive move right when we can block it with tempo but you got to learn how to make these kinds of moves um yeah so he goes bishop c8 anyway he defends the pun now we need to scour the position for other weaknesses okay what else can we attack here what else can we attack here we can we can go 94 and attack this one absolutely let's tickle him he's low on time so it's a good idea to create more threats and if he plays b6 okay so he moves the rook away okay does he create any threats no where can this knight potentially go where can the snipe potentially where do we want this knight how do we prepare remember the rooks have done their job so we go rook b3 to prepare to sink that knight into p6 what does that accomplish well that gets the bish ooh and there comes the panic okay that we applied a lot of pressure applied pressure there comes the blunder now we give a check and now what do we do now that the bishop has gone from e7 what do we do who can tell me the move we actually just take the pawn yeah well it's not that it's a meltdown he was under tremendous pressure for most of the game now um we can just shift the rook back to b7 and pressure the bishop if the bishop moves away then we take f7 so we take f7 where three puns up we take g6 and here we have an intermediate move who can tell me the intermediate move well we go here i have to move now what we want to do here is we want to get the rook out of b7 so we give a check now we give another check we take the rook we move away from the check we can go here and we win the game okay because if his king moves and we take the bishop so if we took the bishop immediately i'm trying to be accurate until the end we give up that was a really nice game and it was very well played by dm thank you thank you for the game let's unpack what happened here now this is the jabal london uh the reason it's called that is as i've explained before it has sort of roots from well badur jabba george and gm uh really popularized this in the last couple of years uh this this has been around for a very long time it was first played in 1882 by james mason who was one of the strongest players in he was irish actually but he was definitely top 20 in the world in the 19th century so james mason actually played this in 1882 alekhine was the fourth person to play this alekhine played it twice that's how good these people were um and then it really was only played a handful of times until the 80s then in the 80s people started playing it in the 90s people played it and then really in the last 10 years badorja baba really started playing it regularly i picked it up about five years ago i thought it was a good way to avoid theory it's very venomous opening very venomous now the reason that it is frowned upon what is the reason that the move knight c3 is frowned upon in general this is called the varisov the traditional varasav is to put the bishop on g5 but why is this like not considered to be mainstream yeah because it blocks the c pawn and as you guys know in the queen's pawn openings the move c4 is like very commonplace that's the main line so when you block the c pawn you have no way of contesting black's control over the center but i think it's better than the varys up now essentially part of the idea of playing the jaba is that white actually can play oftentimes on the king's side and ideas like playing g4 are very common here so bishop f5 f3 is one of the main lines and white literally wants to play g4 and h4 jabba himself often pops into the stream so like g4 and h4 is oftentimes a very very typical idea i've played like this and white basically plays this like a karo khan like white just attacks the king side very modern chess right people wouldn't do this 100 years ago because this looks outrageous how could you move your pawns here what are you doing well white can castle the other side and why can't even keep his king in the center i can even park the king on f2 which is a surprisingly safe square and um to show you guys like a good example of of how i applied this stuff i'll run through very quickly one of my games in the java where i applied this idea and i'll show you why it's not that easy for black to uh to really exploit the weakness of the king it's it's you know this doesn't tell the whole story so here's a good game of mine now seductive orange looks like i guilted enough people we do we do have to get to 5700 we're two away that we have to do so basically as you guys can see here's f3 g4 and h4 um that is what i just showed you guys and what happens is i don't actually cancel hurts gifting to the raven try thank you but basically yeah there we go king f2 and lamelac with the tier one thank you now here's the here's the the rub here the king may look very weak but it's actually very hard to get to it it is true that i have pushed out my pawns to g4 and h4 but that doesn't mean the king is easy to attack that's hard for me to sort of explain at a granular level but i hope this makes sense and what happens in this game is that i actually checkmate him on the queen side i get my pieces to the open g file and i just attack him my king remains very safe the entire game rook c8 penetrating king takes g3 it eventually moves to g3 thank you five minutes dead and the game ends when i just basically just checkmate him knight takes d5 ends the game because if he takes then queen takes e8 and the king actually participates as an attacker rook after king g4 would win win the king it's queen is also hanging so that was a nice game that's a you know there's more to analyze here i've played the juba many many times whoa holy smokes phineas gage75 gifted to the community my man amazing thank you phineas for gifting to friendly mayhem light opsb clayton sororex and paul r hanson ctrl gets that 3am hype going love it thank you for the five gifted sir yeah it'll be hard to play for it'll be hard to play for for for lower rated people because it involves like not because i'm trying to condescend to anybody it just involves knowing when to violate these principles right things like king safety you don't want to play you don't want to mess around with that's playing with fire um so the juba is a very dangerous opening to play um i always compare this and have since the start of the speed run like think of driving a bus right you haven't learned how to drive a car and you sit down behind a bus and now you're trying to navigate the city streets right you need to master the mechanics fully before you attempt something relatively crazy and even i crash that bus sometimes i've lost some painful games of jaba okay now let's go back to the game basically he goes c5 which is one of the main lines and knight c6 is a very typical mistake so a6 here either before or after c takes d4 e takes d4 is the main line a6 stops knight b5 and in this position you can go either knight c6 or you can go bishop g4 immediately pin the knight and increase the pressure on the d4 pawn this is one of the main lines of the juba black has a fine position here it's you know there's a lot of theory here i've played several games in this line knight c6 is a mistake in ip5 and now look at what happens he cannot stop knight c7 literally king to d7 here is very bad because of bishop c7 and a position like this is just absolute disaster look at his king 95 check is coming a 95 check is coming that's going to be absolutely devastating so yeah this is horrible uh a6 is not wasting time a6 stops knight b5 and potentially prepares b5 so you got to do what you got to do in chess okay so e5 d takes e5 a6 and now um if 94 i've showed this before what is white's best move here and um what what follow-up tactic does white have here good good job by my opponent not missing this often times people tilt into missing this yeah queen d5 queen e5 knight c7 and you pick off the queen your two pawns up the king is lost it's castling right black is completely lost so that's a nice little follow-up a6 knight c3 and now d4 very good move because now if he moves to the knight we can just take on d5 with the knight the d4 takes takes takes king d8 castling with check and now b takes c3 and the thing is f takes g7 bishop g7 helps him develop his bishop you want to be careful about not moving your opponent's pieces for him right by by doing this we both ruin our pawn structure respectively but that's okay because i'm the one who's up a pawn this is not going to be easy to win though at all why did he take your queen with his king instead of his knight that's a good question i i think he should have probably taken with the knight i think because it's an end game that would probably not have substantively changed the evaluation because now he has to waste a tempo improving the position of his knight um and that in effect is similar to him moving his king in fact the end result of this will be exactly the same if he plays knight c6 that literally transposes to the position from the game that literally transposes to the position from the game okay so bishop c4 stopping him from get going bishop e6 um he goes bishop e6 anyway and now bishop d5 one of the key moves in this game so bishop takes c6 would be bad although it would trade pieces which is good what's bad about this is it corrects his pawn structure and there's no need to do that unprovoked bishop b3 is the typical move in such positions but it allows them to trap the bishop so concretely it just doesn't work and that's why we played bishop d5 centralizing the bishop now we go g3 to defend the pawn trade on your own terms and now c4 is the inaccuracy that i mentioned e4 was better because his knight is totally limited by the pawn my good friend robert hess he talks about this all the time when the pawn is three squares away or depending on how you look at it two squares let's say in between the pawn and the knight and they're on the same file the pawn often restricts the knight you guys you guys can see that the pawn on c3 bad as it appears is actually completely restricting the knight from either jumping into the center and jumping onto the queen side i actually didn't fully appreciate that and pushing the pawn to c4 opens up the possibility for knight b4 not a good move but we did damage control successfully here e4 supporting the bishop okay he wins the pawn back white is still better i've got this huge outpost if he ever takes then the piece is replaced by an equally strong pawn and his knight gets in trouble doesn't have any waist back so knight c6 rook t3 doubling the rooks taking on e5 why did we want to trade knight because there's no reason not to right there's absolutely no reason not to um i think uh master c i think that exists on my youtube channel if you go into playlists i think that actually does exist my editor has been working very hard to ensure that that happens so you should check it out if not i will make sure that that is done but i'm pretty sure that that actually already exists one second because the knight is active and the knight is the actual tool that he can use uh to attack the c4 pawn like the c4 pawn is weak by taking on e5 we remove the load on that pawn the other thing is you could easily have a situation where you have a very bad bishop for a good knight so bishop takes d5 we could choose between taking with the pawn which a case could be made for that's a pass pawn but i would def definitely take with a knight here look at how monstrous this knight is look at how bad this bishop is staring at a bunch of its pawns of its own color that's the other reason we want to trade thank you nathan or as for the prime take that horsey off the board h4 hopefully the logic behind this move makes sense to remind you guys we want to go king c1 why do we want to go king c1 because we do want to take this pawn but we cannot take it because he pins the bishop and wins it so we need to move the king we can move it to the a file but then we would draw it further away from the center we don't want that and we want to go king c1 for it to be closer to the center we can't do that because of bishop g5 check that sends the king right back where it came from so h4 covers the g5 square now we go king c1 bishop g4 rook d2 right not playing f3 just got to be in general careful when you push pawns particularly in the end game because you create weaknesses no need to create that weakness we go rook d2 bishop c8 knight a4 pressuring the pawn on c5 now we go rook b3 preparing potentially the moon knight v6 now we're not threatening knight b6 immediately because he's got two rooks covering that but we're accumulating the pressure and we're also by the way attacking the pawn which i don't see a good way for him to defend if he went b6 um defending the pawn who could propose a plan what would we do in this position like what specifically would be a good plan here for white and this is actually not easy to play yeah nice so one good plan would be to bring the king to e1 and what this does is it takes away the task of defending the f pawn from the rook which means that now we can bring the world to the default guess what we are attacking b6 now we're attacking v6 now it is true he can defend a bishop d8 but i want to show like some of the key ideas now maybe we decide okay the knight has done its job let's bring the knight to c3 we can even play bishop a8 because that bishop is pretty unassailable and the bishop could be replaced with a knife so in such positions what you want to remember is to play very slowly it's important not to rush and you want to poke and prod poking and prodding is the key to winning these positions you can't win it in one fell swoop it's not easy but when you poke it ultimately your opponent is very likely to make a blunder just because that that's how it is and that's what happened here he went low on time b5 yeah not the last flyerton thank you heatley31 he blunders the pawn our rook gets in we blunder we win the other pawn rook b7 we win the third pawn and now a simple intermediate move right if we take here he takes here we're still winning but no need to do that we give a check and another check saving the rook and now we win the rook and now we win the bishop and he lost on time but the game is over anyway so does that all make sense guys does all everything i did here make perfect sense um we sort of we put the pressure on my only real serious mistake i think was was the move um was the move c4 i think that that wasn't practicing what i preached it opened up the b4 square but we prioritized correctly and we managed to push him off the board eventually [Music] you
