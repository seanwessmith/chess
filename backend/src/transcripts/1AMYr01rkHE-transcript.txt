[Music] okay so let's play a uh let's play another sicilian and we have been playing mostly the accelerated dragon in the speed run and this guy plays what's called the rosso limo bishop b5 this is kind of like the rye lopez against the sicilian and if you are an accelerated dragon player thank you broken sloth it's a good idea to play g6 here anyway because that keeps things consistent holy smokes sc nes all-star now which way should we take on c6 thank you for the five gifted mom man girl what should we take on c6 with so we can take with the b-pawn toward the center but i'm actually going to take with the d-pawn and after the game i'll delve into the reasons for this but basically it's a good idea to open up our bishop and it's also a good idea to open up the default thank you veena blair for the prime now we're gonna play the move e5 the idea of this move is to clamp down on the center where should we get this knight okay where should we put this knight it blocks my bishop and again i will explain the opening in a lot of depth absolutely we should get it to e7 for two reasons first of all we don't want to blunder the spawn second of all we want to be able to play a five later now our opponent plays c3 he's not actually threatening d4 one two three four one two three simple counting we can absolutely go even if he did play d4 that would not be a problem because it would open up our bishop our bishop has a lot of potential energy what do i see here yar thank you three months at once okay so the pawn on d3 is weak pawn on d3 is weak how do we attack it who can tell me the two main ways that we can pressure that pawn there are two main ways we see a weakness we want to attack it the first is the very brute force method no c4 actually he can just take gypsy thank you yes versus to get the bishop to a6 second is to double up on the d file let's do let's try to do both q q and d prime let's go f6 never play f6 i hear you say it's not a problem he doesn't have any pieces to exploit it with right it's okay to play f6 temporarily and now let's do the other thing queen d7 rook fd8 is going to be our idea to pressure the pawn on d3 i hope everything's making sense we're playing the 2300 so i'm playing a little bit faster than usual because if i get into time pressure against this guy i might land in in some trouble but hopefully everything is making sense we're just trying to attack that pawn if we're able to win the pawn then guess what his position is going to collapse okay a5 we're gonna go b5 get out of c4 now what he's accomplished here successfully is he has managed to block in our bishop but uh that's still okay thank you ryan okay so what should we do well actually let me think for a second guys hmm actually this guy tricked me a little bit here now this idea is to go bishop e3 that's why this is annoying his idea is to go well b4 actually might be what we want to do here um this pawn is weak and i didn't pay enough attention to it so let's think about this for a second okay hmm yeah we need to find a good move here okay we're gonna go queen e6 and i'll explain this after the game we're gonna go queenie says by and large our idea is to defend against queen b3 and now we want to prepare b4 so previously the move b4 would not have been good because he would have had this very nasty little check on b3 now we are able to play b4 and we're able to combine it with the move rook ft8 attacking why not rook 88 because the pawn on a7 might be hanging later and i want to make sure the rook on 8 supervises that for now okay okay so the battle now revolves around the pawn on d4 all right how can we go about putting maximum pressure on that pawn and think about it this way there's many ways to do this we can double rooks that's absolutely true let's do it we could have also gotten b3 and chased his night away this is a very complicated position i don't have much time on my clock i'm gonna have to play a little bit fast i warned you guys about this there will be situations where i don't get a chance to explain thanks to the level that i want to explain that but right now we're going to chase his knight away and we're going to dig a little hole for him here and we're going to do that by going c4 we're going to bury his knight on a3 basically that's kind of the rationale behind this this guy is really really good actually really good so i'm gonna have to accelerate the pace a little bit but the bottom line here is we still want to play on the d file and he tries to unbury his knight another very good move okay it's a little manga s here but we'll be fine no they're good these people are now good now let's um let's improve the position of our bishop let's put it on a square where it's defended by a pawn okay he's getting his knight to a better square let's do the same thing let's reroute our own knight to d6 let's reroute our own knight to d6 okay so far everything should be making sense we're just sort of maneuvering our pieces to better squares each one of us and now let's cement our bishop with a6 i don't want to worry about this pawn being in a dark square so let's make it defended no no it's okay i i usually will be able to talk this guy is extremely underrated so i'm going to have to be so now we're going to get the bishop to a better square channel no 5x thank you for the gift now what's going to be our plan our plan is eventually going to be to pile up on the d-pawn but before we do that we want to make sure our pieces are on better squares now we're going to go knight f7 in order to open up our rook so that they can give pressure okay so he he decides to open that which way should we take who can tell me which should we take with the knight or the pawn we should take with the very important not the knight actually we should take with the pawn the reason we shouldn't take with the knight is because it would have weakened the d4 square now we take the rook and who can tell me where we put this rook where do we put it d7 d6 d5 all the way to d3 we put it on this beautiful outpost and now let's bring our bishop into the game with bishop h6 actually that wasn't great because of bishop e3 but you do something that wasn't great no problem we just bring the bishop back it's okay and now let's go h5 to pressure his knight okay now we're starting to really really put the heat on him another idea to consider would be c5 to lock out his bishop so it remains stranded on b6 there's a lot going on trust me guys if you can tolerate this um i'll make this worth your while i'll make this really instructive there's there's a lot of concepts to unpack um so there's a lot of concepts to unpack here through the lens of this game and now i'm gonna activate the bishop look how i'm slowly but surely i'm pushing him off the board and actually he just trapped my rook but even that's fine we can just sacrifice it yeah this is this guy is actually like i would say i am i am strength easily he's i am strength easily okay let's go knight five i'm gonna sacrifice the exchange that rook is gonna be replaced with a beast of a pawn though and um [Music] okay let's go queen e6 to defend the fun oh and i blundered this uh i'm getting nervous myself okay let's take yeah we're gonna sacrifice on h3 yeah these russians are freaking good go back these russians are freaking really really good okay knight h3 sacrificing the knight if he takes it he gets checkmated i think he maybe he knows he's playing against my speedrun again he's bringing his a-game okay i'm trying to checkmate him here on h4 my knight is restricting his queen this guy finding all sorts of stuff and he wants to checkmate me now oh no that's actually not good um okay let's get our night back another really good move jesus yeah he might just be beating me here hmm it's taking a long time now i think i'm winning because i got this beautiful passer look at this passer guys this is going to win me the game and in the end i'm going to just get my king around and promote this guy was really good i'm telling you i really tried this guy was like gm strength um that was like a really solid game for me actually too jeez no i think here he's lost because because of h2 my apologies guys i'm sorry for not explaining stuff at the end but let's unpack this and that's how we'll end the stream this will be um and we crossed 2100 perfect so trust me i'll make everything understandable russians are just built different well yeah this guy was a just incredible okay you want to do you want to do one more instead of analyzing well i feel like i feel like analyzing is going to be important though because i know that people like me to play but um but analyzing trust me is it's gonna pay off okay so accuracy was probably low because we were in time pressure i wouldn't put too much stock in the accuracy um because because um at the end we were both scrambling but 80 percent it was 79.1 and mine was 87.5 so i've actually played really well gemsy b5 gifted subs yeah i know i know i was checking the accuracy it was 79.1 to 87.5 um okay which is solid for blitz all right so he plays the rosalina but should be five okay now um the idea of this move yeah it's like you're playing the rye lopez against the sicilian uh it became popular really only in the last couple of years it features very often at the high level and we get this kind of position this kind of structure now there's good news and bad news for black there's good news and bad news for black the good news for black is that i have the two bishops and um i have a nicely fiance bishop the bad news is uh you know there is a pretty big defect in the pawn structure the reason i didn't take bc by the way this is a legitimate move is um well you guys know that i like developing the bishop on the main diagonal now i'm gonna have to waste another move and also uh let's go at it from the perspective of why dc is good the reason dc is good is because in a position like this and let me know if this doesn't make sense you guys see how big of a clamp i have on this d4 square this square is completely mine that makes it very hard for him to free his position up in the center if we do the same thing after bc watch what's going to happen if you go e5 right compare this position to this position you literally have let me actually make the same you know the same moves right you have the pawn on d7 which makes it possible for him to go d4 it's like a marotzi bind he goes d4 and he opens up his position now a lot of people were thinking what we're saying doesn't e5 block our own bishop and i need to come back to the point that i always make here about chess being like an omelette at this level you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs i repeat that like a broken record all the time um so sometimes you need to accomplish something in chess and that involves making one of your pieces bad there's also a famous saying uh originally formulated by a romanian brand master mihai shuba who said bad bishops defend good pawns and that's a very profound thing to say because the bishop itself might look bad but it's still like atlas holding its worlds holding the world on its shoulders it's defending the pawn on e5 and the pawn on e5 is actually incredibly strong it's a beast so rather than looking at the bishop as one heyman budge as one kind of unit think of the bishop and the pawn as one unit think of this as one unit and together they're accomplishing something great the bishop is like an extension of the pawn or the pawn is an extension of the bishop thank you the real mr parent for 500 bits thank you so much does that make sense so that doesn't mean you have to willy-nilly go around make all of your pieces bad but what it does mean is that sometimes a piece may may be bad in the sense that it doesn't control a lot of squares but it may be in charge of defending something that's important okay they're a unit they're a team that's why we put the knight on e7 another 500 bits jayrud my man guys you're spoiling me um 97 because knight f6 would blunder the pawn and it would interfere with my control over d4 so 97 c3 castles and d3 so c3 was not a good move because he weakens the square now upon his weak we have two ways to attack it we can simply double on the d file or we can put the bishop my six i actually think this was an inaccuracy i think i should have probably started by doubling on the d file that might have been a little bit simpler thank you gm shadow for the prep my opponent found a very good idea in response to it which is to get the knight to c4 and block the bishop also something i want to point out a lot of people confuse attacking a weakness with getting rid of it don't play a move like c4 because that actually helps them get rid of the weakness um and that's something you've got to keep straight in your mind when you're attacking a weakness be careful about doing it with the pawn because that might help him actually get rid of it so b6 bishop a6 knight c4 now um i played f6 in order to defend pawn e5 but there was one thing that i underestimated here in addition to weakening the general king side could somebody point out to me in the context of this position what is the secondary weakness of the move f6 this this move facilitates something that he can now do easier and this is begins to be a headache so not the e6 square because he cannot but yeah but he can't get his knight there remember the concept of inaccessibility first of all it weakens the diagonal but second of all what idea does it make simpler to achieve for white remember yeah good so d4 is now easier to achieve because the bishop is no longer controlling that square and that's going to be a headache in addition it weakens the diagonal something i also underestimated so a4 he pushes his pawn to a5 what is his idea he has two ideas the first after i go b5 is that my bishop is no longer attacking the pawn the second is he's weak in the c5 pawn which you can now pick off by playing bishop e3 i didn't quite you know i think i underestimated this stuff and at this point i began to realize that the position gets really complicated so if we go rook ft-8 he counter attacks this pawn with bishop e3 and it's not easy to defend the spawn and attack this one at the same time so after a5 could you go rook fda yes but um here he can play queen b3 creating the possibility for a discovered check and if you move the king he takes the pawn so i think i actually kind of had to go b5 so why did i play queen e6 at this point i realized that if i play b4 he plays cb and as many of you have internet what does white have we talked about this during the game yup that's why it's all going to go on youtube he has the very simple move queen b3 check now some of you might look at this and say well that's not a problem right you can trade pawns but it is a problem we were supposed to win the pawn on d3 not exchange it also this is just disgusting i'm not gonna allow this i don't want to just give up this one so i played queen e6 in order to cover once and for all this diagonal and what i wanted to do was reposition my rook on d8 the rook being the more weighty attacker does that make sense so he goes bishop e3 and at this point my resources are starting to get stretched then so i go b4 and rook fda now the difference between this scenario and like this scenario is that the position is a little bit more closed which is in my favor if he plays bishop takes c5 i can go rook takes d3 and attack his queen and fork is one this is actually good for black um so d4 by white emphasizing the secondary problem with the move f6 and this is where things get super complicated so let's understand this position from a broad perspective i always like to talk about the zen of the position or what the game is revolving around and that makes things easier to see what the game is revolving around is control of the d4 square scenario that is good for black is i win this pawn or i'm somehow able to put enough pressure on the spawn to make it collapse the scenario that works for white is you know he's able to get to my weak pawns on the queen side and he's able to retain his control over the center which is why i double rooks that shouldn't be a mystery to anybody doubling rooks increases the pressure on the d4 pawn this should also not be a mystery to anyone how do you decide well it's just visually obvious right i mean look at how many attack look at how what everything is attacking and defending the square there's like a million sources of tension one dollar thank you mr glocks did you get my other donut um i think i might have missed a donation ten bucks for mr twox i'm so sorry i missed that uh yeah i would recommend playing 10 minutes if you're 1k thank you for the 10 bucks mr block sorry for missing that i would say 10 min 10 minutes for now so queen c1 why does he play this move to unpin himself from the d file uh if i can complete the doubling of the rooks he can take the pawn so that's why i go b3 his knight is the defender of the pawn on d4 therefore we remove uh the knight okay yeah so for now the game is revolving around that now i don't want to play the move c takes d4 why because that would open up the c file for his queen he made a very forward-thinking move by putting his queen there i don't want to let his queen have any access to square so that that's why i played c4 trying to bury his knight on a3 the problem with this move is that it it dries up the structure on the queen side it opens up the diagonal for his bishop after he takes and my own bishop on a6 is now also kind of lame yes bad bishops defend good puns but you don't want to take that too far so qui outus potentially but probably not now because that would be premature so i double the rooks he gets his knight to a better square now i get my bishop to a better square where it's at least protected by a pawn now he makes this very ray lopez-like maneuver getting his knight to the queen side i get my knight to the center and he goes king h2 which is a very russian school of chess move he just like improves the position of his king he gets it away from the danger potential danger zone and i also make a russian move a6 reinforcing the bishop and also the pawn on a7 is annoying me because i could imagine a future where he takes on e5 and he can take the pawn on a7 if my rook ever leaves decent hopefully this is making sense so for rookie two uh getting his rook to d2 he could have played rook t1 also and bishop f8 is how i tried to solve uh you know it's just sort of a waiting move well at this point the battle has shifted right when i play the moment i played c4 the battle has shifted from the d4 pawn which is still a hot hot spot but now we enter this sort of maneuvering phase both of us you know we sign a little cease-fire there's no immediate threat that either side has so there's a mutual understanding that both of us have to improve our pieces before the battle heats up again does that kind of make sense so he improves his knight i improve mine he gets his king to a marginally better spot improves his rook i improve my bishop now i drop my knight back to f7 so that the g5 square is covered now here uh knight takes e5 is tempting but it would have yielded this beautiful outpost on d4 which is not what i wanted to do well uh tobias chess bishop f8 bishop h6 is not a problem i can even trade bishops and drop my knight back to f7 with tempo i wouldn't really mind the trade of bishops right so i can talk about this forever but let's so bishop b6 i think he made a mistake by taking he he shouldn't have given up the defile like that and i have now won the battle over the d file in a certain sense right rook on d3 is beautiful and now i start improving my pieces bishop h6 i forgot he can drop his bishop back so we repeated moves and instead i went h5 in order to get his knight away from g3 and try to push him back run him out of the gym now i go c5 in order to lock his bishop out of b5 the bishop is in jail at this point i think black is much better but i made a big mistake and he found an absolutely brilliant idea so here i played queen d6 why get the queen to the default what is white's idea here why did he play queen e1 like why is this necessary and so he wants to trade rooks the stroke on d3 is like a bone in his throat i don't want allowance to trade rooks i want my rook to remain on d3 but i made a very key mistake i didn't ask myself what he wanted with this move knight t1 not h1 i didn't ask myself what my opponent wanted i simply didn't realize that knight f2 was his idea well rook d1 is strong because the rook on d3 is strong i don't want to get that one treated i think i had a beautiful prophylactic idea here to stop knight f2 and that is the move knight g5 who sees how knight f2 is met like how is this met the idea of knight g5 and you should immediately see the forkability of the knight on the rook of the king and the queen sorry neither of the pieces i just mentioned were correct rook f3 he can't take the rook because of knight takes f3 check with the four and uh i think this would have been the correct move but instead i played bishop h6 well h4 rook takes f2 the line goes on but we won't talk about that now and i lose the exchange and it's important not to panic in this situation first i give a check on f4 i wanted to soften him up with g3 so that i can then get my knight to g5 but he correctly got his king back to h1 and i decided okay uh the thing the good thing here is that even if he takes my rook the rook is replaced with a pawn that is also a beast and i can potentially support that beast by going to c4 now why didn't i go c4 here that is a very tempting move who can tell me what drawback the move c4 contains and frees the bishop bishop gets out of jail get out of jail free card i don't want to get the bishop out of joe my big chance here is the fact that the bishop is in jail um because that gives me the possibility of attacking his king with one of his pieces essentially incarcerated the problem though is i don't have the resources necessary to guard the pawn on b3 and i panicked here not really i actually found a cool idea but i had no choice but to let his bishop out of jail with queen e6 now the problem is taking on d2 would not be good because my dark skirt bishop is my main attacker i don't want to trade but maybe i should have done that i don't know when e6 my idea here was to capture on h3 something that i did a little bit later knight takes h3 knight takes h3 why can't he take the knight because i played queen takes h3 now i give another check on h2 with a bishop and regardless of where he goes i win his queen and checkmate will follow soon after so knight takes h3 is a good tactical idea this at least at least wins back upon and now my knight is is very nicely positioned on an outpost i further the outpost with 92 and now queen f6 was a very good move what is the purpose of this move the purpose of this move is to tie down his queen to this diagonal because if he moves his queen he gets checkmate but he found a beautiful way around it queen f2 is so strong and if i do just about anything here he gives me a check and then another check and he drives my king out and that's not going to end well so i left the bishop out of jail that's why i played knight d4 i need to intercept the queen's access to a7 he still gave me a check i could have probably repeated moves with a draw but i didn't want to draw so i was able to park my king on h6 and the reason that the game isn't over that white is not winning is because of this pawn that is my biggest asset and at this point i decided to trade queens because he's threatening the very nasty move rook v6 now most people wouldn't really do this because we're down in exchange in an end game but i would argue that winning this is not simple at all again because the pawn on d3 ties down his knight so he can simply do nothing and make a draw but my opponent and time pressure started to panic the move h4 i didn't just make for you know for no reason i anticipated a future where i would be able to eliminate this pawn on g2 and so i preemptively advanced my passport thank you xa1 cap 03 and x and rook takes p5 was very panicky he shouldn't have done that he should have probably gone about winning this position by coming around to c3 and trying to snag the pawn on v3 slowly but surely not easy but doable but in time pressure he sacrificed back the exchange the position remains very unclear but now i was able to get my knight to g2 pave the way for the pawn and he lost on time here so maybe white can draw by getting the king to g1 although it's very very close i do think black is actually maybe winning i don't know who's winning maybe why is he winning i don't know so anyway he lost on time here in a very unclear position very rich game you could see how many stages this game had at first i was out playing him then he found this very nice idea that introduced a lot of weaknesses in my position the battle was revolving around the d-bond for a while then we locked things up we had a maneuvering stage where we both improved our pieces then the position opened up again and we had the defile stage then he trapped my rook we had a stage of the game where he was up in exchange so you know so many different places that we visited in this game and i hope that i was able to at least partially clarify the motivations behind the move it was very complex i could talk about this for for hours uh but you know this guy played an unbelievably good game you know so you can see how the higher rated you get really this stuff is very complicated even for me i have to fully engage with the position against players like these and i'm capable of making misjudgments and mistakes just like any of you guys so hopefully this gives you a certain sense of inspiration i you know like a move like b5 i played mindlessly not realizing that hey i was gonna pay the price for this weakness it's just that my mistakes are maybe on a more subtle level but that doesn't mean i don't make them and that doesn't mean uh that i don't commit the same kinds of hallucinations and misjudgments that any of you guys do so you shouldn't put anybody on a pedestal um okay so any questions [Music]
