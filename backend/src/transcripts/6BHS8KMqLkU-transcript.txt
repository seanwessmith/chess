and i'll play e-dog he's a long-time supporter on my channel and i'm going to play e4 let's try to make this more tactical okay another modern another modern so we're going to play it exactly the same way that we played the last game bishop to e3 okay this is literally exactly the same this time let's play h4 immediately it doesn't really matter the order in which we play h4 as long as we play it at some point and he actually responds in exactly the same way so this is all the same this is literally all the same as that first game we played and remember that in this position ultimately black wants to develop his bishop to b7 which is why we want to play the move f3 we want to buttress and reinforce the pawn so we don't have to worry about it and so that when the bishop appears on b7 it's not actually immediately attacking upon now could somebody remind me in this position somebody remind me in this position what is the key maneuver that we play as a consequence of him weakening a certain square so gigahertz for now i'm gonna not develop the bishop at all i don't need to yet let's see what he does and then we will decide where to put the bishop we can also fianchetto the bishop that's not out of the question but we don't need to worry about it yet whoa skye bobbles another 500 bits girl yeah nike fun absolutely and we might play this a little bit differently from that other game uh just to show you guys the range of ideas we may have now what's on the docket for us here oh my god oh okay okay i just got baited that's 500 bucks right there okay so basically nice one siddhant what should we do now in the in the name of flexibility between castling and um developing the bishop which of these should we prefer and actually there's this oh i want to show you guys a really interesting idea i want to show you guys a really interesting idea in terms of developing this bishop as i explained the first time when we play bishop d3 we sever our contact with the d4 pawn so we we facilitate the move c5 we make it stronger when we castle what happens is he plays c5 we can take on c5 and our control over the d-file has been increased which discourages him from playing c5 but there is a third idea that we can play i'm going to tell you guys the first move and i want you to tell me the second and i'm going to give you a hint it's not bishop g2 where the hell is the bishop actually yeah what are we preparing with this move what are we like insinuating this is not a move that i'm necessarily going to play but it's a move that he's now gonna have to reckon with for the rest of the game five thousand five dollars oh my god yeah sacrifice on e6 absolutely we might sack on e6 break through his center and then win the bishop on g7 that might be an idea and i want to make it very clear that we're not necessarily going to do it on the next move or if we don't the idea has failed in fact we can even make it stronger so let's calculate this should be six takes knight takes e6 attack is queen the problem is he moves his queen and then when we play knight takes g7 he goes king f7 i'll show this after the game the knight is gonna be trapped so let us prepare the idea of bishop takes e6 how can we do that how can we prepare bishop takes 66. you guys are already familiar with this move because we played it in the last game well d5 he goes e5 yeah knight f4 knight f4 increases the pressure on the pawn remember that that's why we played 92 the knight is on its ideal square notice that we haven't even castled yet we haven't needed to the king is perfectly fine in the center for now if he finds a way to defend against this stuff fine then we're going to castle but right now we're prioritizing the immediate attack we want to just checkmate him here okay okay so like yeah whoa i mean if he goes up five already beer whoa this pun is going to be dead meat it's gonna be toast so he has i'm not gonna say the best move i mean his best move is knight fa his best move is knight fate which is a very nasty move to play because it it defeats his ability to castle let me tell you guys he cannot allow knight takes c6 that would be a total disaster that's right flowerton that would be the second best move let's just say but allowing knight takes e6 is just absolute devastation uh zac ticks i don't think there is a most people i think you can run some statistics but everybody is completely different no i don't know e dog doesn't stream snipe this guy's honorable but just in case uh but he's very honorable he doesn't stream tonight and i don't hold it against people if they stream snipe what would the speed run it's that that would be fine so i mean oh my god okay that f8 now what is the idea of knight f8 what does that move accomplish what that accomplishes is it defends e6 it defends e6 so if we take on e6 twice he's going to take back and we're not going to have a knight any longer so let's just develop our pieces by castling no i think he just found it i mean that's that's a findable move that's definitely a findable move let's give him the benefit of the doubt yeah guys e-dog is i'm not gonna have shade thrown on him so how did i why do i castle because we're patient here we're not rushing with any sacrifices we're just increasing the pressure by completing our development okay so now we need to find a way to increase that pressure but we can actually procrastinate in a good way on that task we can procrastinate in a good way on the task chess procrastination involves playing a healthy waiting move when we castle we already talked at length uh about what kind of move that may be so what is that healthy waiting move king b1 yep let's yeah so he takes but now his dark squares are really weak yes he makes this move less likely but look at all these dark squares that he's weakened by giving up his like main bishop okay he's attacking this font we can't defend it directly but we can move this knight away where should we move it we should move it toward the center so that it remains relevant and now our strategy should be to open up the position when our opponent gives up a very important piece that supervises so many squares uh it's really important to open up the position in order to be able to take advantage of those squares now i know a lot of you guys at this point are thinking either e5 or d5 but we got to be careful about these moves because he can just go forward if we go e5 he's going to go d5 if we go d5 he's going to go e5 there is a third way to open up the position yeah so we could play f4 f5 that's one good idea that's actually a great idea but c3 would be another c3 would be another way to open up the position okay which way should we take a bit of a trick question how should we say let's think think think think c takes c takes d3 excuse me two reasons sorry wrong passageway wrong passageway two reasons what do we open up look at the center we create look at how we're now defending the e pawn c file beautiful file we don't even need to occupy it but guess what we can let's employ this rook on the c file where does the other rook be long where does the other rook belong wrong tube yeah in russian you say wrong throat it belongs on the f file why does it belong in the file because once we play f5 we are going to stomp on his position crunch boom boom bang powdered bing bang pow bing bang boom and now what are we going to take on f5 with another trick question don't rush if we were to play this creatively dania style we want to take with a rook because we want to preserve this bishop as the main attacker look at how his king is completely caught on the crossfire now we want to try to find avenues to his kick what can we use to get to his king well we already have a rook on c1 if that's a natural thing to follow up on we just need to enhance the attack on the on the pawn on c7 so the move is bishop f4 bingo now i look at this knight on h7 and i say it's a type 2 undefended piece only the rook is defending the knight can we attack that rook using the piece that we just improved yeah there's so many possible moves here i don't want to create the impression that there's only one way of winning this i mean okay now we ask ourselves what squares have been left behind as a result of this trade what can we now do absolutely queen she five and then rook c6 sexy moves here his knight is lost and he gets checkmated boom and it's made in two his king literally has no escape checkmate that's how you oh that was a rated game oh okay okay i i thought for example for some reason i was on my normal account uh but yeah that's a nice game that's a nice game good game okay so that's why the modern is such a hard opening to play the modern is very hard to play because you have to deal with all of these weak squares right and this idea of g3 bishop h3 is super common i've seen it before i'm sure i can find games right off the bat where where this has been applied this is almost an indistinguishable game from my game against edoc another sub zora okay so literally similar line this is actually not my game against e-dog this is literally another game g3 king b1 b3 to stop knight c4 bishop h3 92 knight f4 literally move by move same ideas now black managed to castle long here black god is king safe but that doesn't diminish the the the sort of the strength of this idea really and and in the game white opens up the game with d5 he opens up these files and white went on with a to a crushing victory white just has complete dominance over the position and white won the game in the end so the point of bishop h3 is to increase the pressure on the e6 pawn that doesn't necessarily mean we will definitely sacrifice on e6 but um when you increase the pressure on something you force your opponent to worry about it force your opponent to allocate resources to its defense and that raises the likelihood that your opponent will end up being weak on other sides of the board this is a game between an international master as you guys could see in a 2200. now why didn't i take on e6 the reason i didn't take on e6 is because if you extend the line if you calculate the line after knight g7 king f7 this knight is actually trapped and if we try to defend this knight with bishop h6 black has a really sexy move that um that dislodges the bishop from h6 i still think white is much better here i think white might be winning but uh in light of the next move things get very complicated and i just didn't see a need to do that yeah nike a good job guys considering the retreating moves now this does allow queen f4 check but now the other knight comes to f6 this gets super complex okay so that's why we patiently played knight f4 castles bishop h6 king b1 improving the position and now well bishop e6 here ezra i'm not sure what you would accomplish here i mean there's no bishop on g7 to capture and um you know i'm not sure exactly what you would gain from this i mean why could go d5 to establish the knight on e6 but um i don't think that's the whoa gem gym 10. let's get that hype going appreciate it jim jim 10 gifted to the community as i continue coughing i need some water thank you so much jim jim let's go the train has left the station basically knight c3 defending the pawn and now several ways of opening the position it really went down the wrong tube now c3 is my favorite way of doing that because it attacks b4 and this is another application another application of the principle i have been emphasizing whoa edok 3650 my gracious opponent gifting three subs to the community to kingdro420 junghash brown and i'm brian lefevre my pleasure man thank you for the gift i'd appreciate your support um why does this not why does it not matter that we've opened up the b file what principle allows us to immediately unders understand that this is not dangerous for white like how do i know that how do i know that this is not dangerous for me no pieces first of all white has all these pieces masked together second of all yeah i can even play rock h2 second of all black has no pieces on the queen side black can't pull an attack out of his behind i mean you need pieces on the queen side black is way too bogged down with all of his weaknesses to ever really even dream of a sustained attack and that's a very important thing to realize no pieces in all talk so f4 is what we did in the game in lcd opening the c file beefing up the security of our central pawns that's what's important here not the optical sort of appeal of our center in fact if you learn to look at this the right way this this should actually look better than taking with the queen which would not be bad this isn't like a super significant decision this would actually facilitate f5 so a case could be made for queen takes d3 but cd i think is a little sexier because we don't need to rush to prepare f5 now f5 and now we can take with the bishop but this is even stronger rook takes preserving the bishop twisting the knife and putting the bishop on e5 attacking the rook and now asking ourselves okay what squares are now accessible to our pieces noticing queen g5 and then finishing off the pressure on the knight with the brook c6 leading into checkmate um well it depends on the weaknesses that you create captain jesus right if if you're worried about getting lobster pincered then don't play g6 right because then your opponent could put a bishop on f6 you need to understand whether there are ways of making luft that don't create as many weaknesses okay wow i think you should ask that to charlie yeah i think i think we should reserve that question for charlie all right so that uh concludes any questions about this game well i mean i think black's last black's last chance i wouldn't take here i would play i would play something like actually maybe i would i would try to castle long here maybe go queen d7 actually maybe even castle short although here i would go g4 to open up the h file um schwarzschild you asked that before i'm not sure exactly what what do you mean with kh3 i never put a king on h3 so if you mean bishop h3 then i explained it i think in sufficient detail the idea is to sacrifice on e6 increase the pressure on the pawn can you elaborate on why rook f5 well basically it's all about understanding what the what the best attackers are this position is so winning that either move is good but rook f5 i think is even better because this bishop is a super valuable attacker and the fact that i sacrifice an exchange shouldn't deter you because look at the just the visual superiority of my pieces over black's pieces and look how important this bishop is this bishop ties itself to the knight it controls all of these squares and it basically is responsible for this big checkmate if this bishop weren't here the king would be able to escape so i was able to basically understand that i was so close to delivering checkmate the bishop would be a very significant piece in the attack if that makes sense it's stronger than multiple black strokes black strokes are just staring at pawns it's hard for me to explain that at a level that perhaps is concrete enough but that's basically the logic if that makes sense well it's hard to see but it's all about not assuming things right when you assume oh i need to capture with the bishop then you don't allow your brain to process these kinds of things and to me this is where intuition comes in this is where experience comes in right i'm able to just judge this immediately because i've attacked like this so many times that um that to me there is no doubt in my mind that this is completely winning okay wittons well i'm not gonna even attempt to pronounce that okay it was spirit off playing oh he's playing okay let's go d4 let's go d4 and let's go with the queen's gambit okay so queen's gambit accepted now it's lacroix what is the purpose of the queen's game what is like the natural follow-up to sacrificing the spawn so what's like the obvious follow-up to this like you you sacked the pawn to get the center now e4 is not the only move and there's also a drawback with e4 which is that you get your pawns to the center but you don't have any pieces develop yet so this is actually one of the moves that is considered to be the main move and now there's a lot of theory here but the main move is to go knight f3 develop the knight and support the pawn taking on e5 leads to an undesirable queen trade okay so bishop before bishop d2 this is theory and what ends up happening here is you end up sacrificing the d4 pawn you capture the c pawn but you get a big lead in development so white is going to have three pieces developed black is going to have zero but black takes the d4 pawn so now at the end of the day black is up the pawn but we've got to lead in development i actually don't know the theory of this too well um but i think we will be able to reconstruct uh what we're supposed to do here so in such positions i think it's a good idea to not overthink it and just continue developing there's no need to do anything crazy so if we were to just continue developing what would that look like yeah we could consider going queen b3 but but he could also defend that pawn with queen e7 i'm not sure that's worth it let's just castle let's just castle and let's see how he positions his pieces that way we'll be able to make a more informed decision about what to do okay so bishop e6 um let's well we can take the bishop and weaken his king slightly i think that makes sense and then we can go queen b3 uh we can also keep the tension with a move like roxy and i do like the idea of taking let's take here okay he's taking his time on f66 all right um and then we have two pawns both of which are undefended so let's go queen v3 and attack both of them and he can defend both of them with queen c8 but then his queen becomes passive there queen d7 is the move okay so obviously i think most people here would be like okay why not queen takes b7 uh then he goes rook b8 we go queen a6 and maybe he takes back on b2 but the end result of that is that the b file gets opened who benefits from the b file getting opened who who benefits from that ultimately ultimately it's of course white it's white because black is not castled yet so when one side isn't castled open files generally benefit the side that has that leading development okay let's go rook ac1 let's put the rook on c1 okay attacking the knight trying to get the knight to move if the knight moves we win a7 so rook b6 is probably what he's going to play okay now where should we move the queen where should we move the queen here what should we do yeah so queen a3 prevents him from castling queen a3 prevents him from castling so i like the idea of going queen a3 now he could go queen e7 but then maybe we shift the queen up to a4 and attack the knight so we were trying to like get him to not castle we're trying to exploit the fact that we have castled and our opponent has not i think that white is better here and uh we're trying to milk that as much as possible if we just let him castle then he would complete his development okay well this looks very dubious because uh now he permanently cannot cast and now our goal is to improve the positioning of our pieces and to simply nurture the initiative so what comes to mind in that regard what what how can we activate our pieces like what ideas can we come up with here so one idea is to go knight c4 and attack and attack his is rook but i actually like a slightly different plan here what i like is the idea of doubling rooks on the c file now why do i like that the reason i like that is because i want you guys to take a good hard look at this knight on c6 okay this knight is not defended by any pawns let's get get this the heck out of there this knight is not defended by any pawns which means if we pile up the pressure on that knight that knight is very likely to end up in super serious trouble if that knight moves then we take on c7 so we're basically keeping knight c4 in our back pocket until the time is right for that if it makes sense as i say it's a pressure point exactly okay so we have many ways now of attacking the knight we can go queen a4 but we don't really want to trade queens i don't want to do that but now the move knight c4 is a whole lot stronger than it was previously although knight c4 maybe rook b5 is kind of annoying so let me think for a second how do we want to do this how do we want to play this let me think for a second how do we want to play this position well 95 he'll take it and and we don't necessarily want to help him absolve himself of that weakness i'm thinking i'm thinking yeah knight g5 is interesting okay let's go hmm let's go queen a4 let's go queen a4 and what i'm basically gonna say is that yes his knight is going to move but even in the end game oh this is a really good move though this is a really good move but uh we can just take here and what my point is that even in the end game the initiative continues uh this is a point that is often very misunderstood by people uh you can trade queens and still be attacking that's not illegal okay you can absolutely trade queens and still be attacked so what should we do now we can actually win some material we can play knight takes e5 and uh we have two pieces for rook i'll explain the the the complications after the game but basically two pieces for a rook is good for us and um in terms of the pawn count we also have equal pawns so right now what's going on here is we're attacking d4 we're attacking c7 we need to consolidate our pieces make sure this pass pawn doesn't go anywhere but look at the piece activity we have we have now the rook on the seventh ring the rook can mow down some of these pawns we're basically gonna play for checkmate here and um we're gonna have to be very careful in how we how we actually orchestrate that because if we go knight 64 he goes rook takes f2 this guy is super super good uh he's actually kind of tricked me a little bit here hmm let me think well d4 hanging but yeah this guy is this guy is super annoying let me think yeah i had a bad feeling about this one okay let's go knight c6 let's go knight c6 and let's play for checkmate i'll explain what i'm doing after the game i'll explain what i'm doing like fully after the game okay now we're gonna go here we're going to take on d4 that was the main idea of knight c6 and take the pawn on our own terms to take the pawn on our own turns okay now we're going to go here and attack this pawn with our oh my god i blundered oh god i blundered uh i've wondered a piece yeah he's going to win this one that's going to be our first loss yeah i had i had a feeling this guy was going to beat me um completely winning position too for white but that's going to be our first loss yeah this guy somehow found a way out of that situation yeah it's that kind of an evening i could just feel it let me try to come back from this if you guys let me focus let me try well this is completely hopeless down in exchange just blended a piece in one move yeah i'm not sure like exactly what we could have done this guy's playing super super well this guy is playing super well no chances here just not leaving me a single chance interesting okay taking a while on row page four yeah he's got so much time hmm yeah okay but um you can count that as a loss that's just some magic i pulled but um you can count that as basically a loss okay um okay i mean i am i am you know i have you know i have to put the foot down sometimes okay i have to put the foot down sometimes that was weird i felt like we were winning but somehow he got out of it it was really like hard to find the actual the actual uh final blow uh it was really weird i i'm i'm usually good in these positions but i was not able to like find anything specific um you played unbelievably well i'll check the accuracies um and legitimately obviously not don't take this the wrong way i'm just curious where the win was um well 95 for me 94.9 for me and 84.3 for him so we still played very well i really only made one mistake this entire game which was the blunder i literally made one mistake which was the blunder that was the only mistake we made in this entire game everything else was best every single other move was best so in a certain sense justice was served he had made in one i don't think he did um so i made this one blunder and and that should have decided the game okay so basically let's go over the game let's go over the game now this was a queen's gambit it was well played by him but it was completely winning for white until the blunder that's what i'm saying well because i've wanted a piece i'll explain it guys um so knight f3 so so so this opening is very theoretical there's there's a lot to there's a lot to unpack here um there's a lot to unpack here and i don't want to delve too deeply into the theory basically yeah this is the queen's gambit accepted and what the battle revolves around is well first of all black can try to cling to the pawn of b5 this is a legitimate line but the problem with this entire setup is that this pawn chain with the pawn on v5 upon c4 uh is not sustainable and white is able to chip away at the spawn chain by force and the spawn chain just isn't able to be sustained so how does white do that how using the principle of attacking the base of the pawn chain we go a4 black goes c6 if i goes a6 then at the end of the day he drops the rook so black has to go c6 but the problem here is that after abcb uh white goes knight c3 legos knight c3 and uh it's actually very hard to defend the spawn if black pushes the pawn then we can pick it off with queen a4 queen takes before if black goes a6 this is actually a legitimate variation uh there is a variation here where you sack the exchange but not everybody knows it what do we do here with white that was a very lucky game yeah knight b5 is correct and believe it or not there is a line where black actually sacrifices the exchange and then plays bishop takes e4 this is actually a legitimate variation where black gets compensation for the exchange but uh white is still supposed to be better here uh if blight knows what to do here white gets an advantage so uh this line does exist but that's how white reacts if black tries to cling to the pawn so most of black strategies revolve around putting immediate pressure on white center and the reason he does that is because white hasn't developed his pieces yet if black lets white develop his pieces um then uh you're not going to have the opportunity to attack white cena that should be kind of uh reasonable to you guys so e5 is part of that strategy okay so d takes e5 here allows black to take the queen and white loses his castling rights and the pawn count is equal so this is no good for white that's why you go knight f3 eat bishop before check so d5 is not that good because you kind of close down the center and this is a variation this is a legitimate line but black can get this blockading square on d6 black just gets a very solid position like this isn't bad but by closing up the center white reduces the effect let's say of his space advantage and black gets uh black gets nice blockade here you know the square in front of an important pawn if it's controlled by the opponent that's kind of not a not a great thing if that makes sense yeah yeah of course so well the benefits of accepting the gambit i mean this is a very legitimate line for black black doesn't get a bad position here if he's very careful okay so it takes takes um somebody asked a question about queen a4 but this is a check so we have to deal with that yeah knight c3 is also a move like all of this is theoretical but the problem with knight c3 is it allows this bishop to remain and sconced on b4 and one thing that could could end up happening is black could be using this pin to his advantage so i'm not exactly sure how but maybe c5 bishop d2 is more forceful right you are removing the only black piece that is developed currently and right now we get the situation this is a theoretical position white's got three pieces above black as zero white has full compensation for the pawn but if black is careful black should not be worse here so i'm not sure exactly where my opponent went wrong but somewhere around here he made a bad move um and he goes bishop e6 which allows us to soften up the position around his king also this pawn is very weak this spawn is very weak so we combine the two observations and we go queen b3 my opponent decided to sacrifice the pawn on b7 i think that was the main mistake this is the sort of position where if you are already accepting the queen's gambit you know that that russian expression having said a you have to say b um if you're already accepting the gambit then you might as well cling to the pawn you might as well suffer for a pawn so queen c8 i think is a better move but um in a position like this i think white's got very nice pressure for the pawn like i think from a human perspective this is a very pleasant position for white there's also ideas like knight c5 here uh in in the air and rook takes c6 ideas as well so i really like these positions for white i think these positions are suitable to my style but um our opponent gives up b7 and he doesn't reach out for b2 and the reason why is that he's just way too underdeveloped here what would uh what would i do in this position what is an example of some of the moves that white could play here to uh to you know to sort of develop the initiative and one thing to remember if you go rook b1 uh black has kind of an annoying move rook back to b6 in my opinion this is kind of annoying and if you take on b6 black closes down the b file so what you would want to do first is go knight c4 to take away the b6 square and only after the rook drops back would you want to play rook a to b1 now you're winning the battle over the c over the b file the rook has no good squares no good save squares to park itself on the b file and if black ignores this knight on c6 you guys should already be aware of right this knight is very vulnerable this knight is also defending the rook which means the knight is overloaded what is a very simple way to take advantage of this overloaded knight and that is to play well queen c6 is very creative but uh then you sacrifice the queen and if you actually calculate out the line uh at the end of it black actually recaptures the knight so it's less clear but the simplest is knight e5 yeah 95 is correct attacking the queen if black takes then you actually win both rooks um so something like this could be the consequence of him taking so he quickly decides to develop but in this position black is in big trouble he can't castle his position is very flimsy now rook c5 is really good now why did i not play knight c4 i know most people wanted to do this well the bottom line reason and you've got to be very careful about over estimating these kinds of moves right the problem with this move is that it closes down the c file it blocks our own biggest asset which is rc file so i wanted to keep this idea in my pocket the threat is stronger than its execution that expression explains a lot of the choices that i'm making here i'm trying to build up the pressure so that when i do play knight c4 it's actually a lot stronger i'm also like not sure maybe i don't want to play knight c4 maybe i will one play queen a4 which is what happened in the game the knight on d2 also has the utility of defending the e4 pawn so you don't want to rush with these kinds of tempting moves very important in my opinion maintaining all control exactly that's well said so knight g4 is just useless now we double rooks and now queen a4 is the best move actually because it attacks the knight forces the knight to move he moves it to e5 which was kind of a fancy move but uh no i wasn't because he has no way to attack the rook he has no actual way to attack the rook if you were to like look at his knights can his knights even hypothetically attack the rook no so not really um knight e5 is fancy but at the end of the day it's the same effect doesn't move like 98 obviously we cannot take the knight because we drop our queen so knight takes queen takes d7 and knight e5 is also correct basically at the end of the day now this is something we need to unpack for a second like he takes knight ft7 a lot of people got confused here now okay queen d1 is a super computer-ish move uh this is not a human move at all to drop the queen back is pretty crazy i think queen e7 is fine um why rook c5 rather than rook c2 or c5 is just a more active mode okay rook c2 also could run into this so roxy 5 is more stable and it's more active and also like the rook also controls the e5 square so this is just objectively the best score for the rook now basically you need to in these positions when there's a lot going on you need to break down exactly which pieces are hanging and that helps you get you know not as mystified about the complexities of the position so if we are to like actually list out all of the stuff that's hanging from white's perspective only the rook and the pawn uh the knight on f3 is not hanging it is protected by the knight and the pawn um from black's perspective black has three things that are hanging the knight the pawn and the other pawn so we can take c7 and if we calculate this line out yes taking c7 is okay but then after knight takes f3 knight takes f3 and rook takes p2 a material is equal and now if we are to take the other thing that's hanging which is the d4 pawn and we are to reevaluate the position what does black have here what nasty move now becomes possible as a consequence of the rook appearing here and that's also a very important thing to do you have to update your perception of the position what was once not hanging can now be hanging where it takes f2 piggy's on the 7th black has a big chance to deliver perpetual or even more so in general two pieces for a rook benefits the two pieces but also if you just compare the activity of the two knights versus the activity of the rooks just visually speaking the knights are running circles over these rooks and black's got all these weak pawns so i just determined that okay i'm probably gonna win a bunch of white black spawns and i'm probably gonna win the game here also the king is very weak king could literally get checkmated in these positions so anyways he started hunting after my pawns i started hunting after his and the critical moments so knight c6 now why did i play this move dilmatic thank you again if we are to take on d4 we blunder the pawn on f2 so i played knight c6 because i potentially wanted to take the pawn with this knight and also i wanted to involve my other knights in g fiber if i had to literally deliver some sort of a checkmate okay i literally wanted to go for checkmate and i was doing it all successfully up until this point so i checked the computer i i now know what the best move was and the best move was to go after this epon which i did but i did it in the wrong way i forgot that this knight was not overloaded this knight is classic overloaded defending two things at once and he takes on d4 and um instead i had a tactical way of going after this pawn which uh ex again bears the same idea as rookie seven and it's a tactical move so we actually directly attack this one who can find it it's a very pretty idea it's knight to d8 yeah it's knight to d8 are we blundering the night no we're not because this is a fork against the king and the rock so we win the game we win the rook in the game and if he doesn't do anything then we simply take on e6 and we just take all of his pawns we've got a devastating attack so this is just winning this is a super nice move and it's not easy to see on demand but this was the fastest way to win the game definitely a five head move but instead rookie seven of d4 and just like that all of the effort has evaporated and white is lost that's that's the brutal that's the reality of chess like you you know you do everything perfectly and then you play one very bad move and and then you're you're busted you're just down an exchange in a pawn and it's only through a literal miracle that i was able to win he kept taking like 10 seconds of move and somehow i managed to flag him but for all intents and purposes uh you know that was a loss well i did take higaro if i take the rook with the knight then he takes my rook that's sort of the point of putting the rook on e7 why it's bad it's putting it in the cross crosshairs of the king and uh that is that is that game yeah a lot a lot of stuff that happened but hopefully uh hopefully i managed to paint the general picture of things that happened so anyways that's that's what happened
