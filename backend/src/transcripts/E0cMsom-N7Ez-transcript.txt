yeah three seconds per move is also what

uh what does it okay

okay 2400 let's focus we are playing a

23.79 guys

yar thank you so much teleportivo with

the tier one

and we are gonna play the king's indian

okay all right guys

i'm a little concerned this guy has won

like

50 out of his last 52 games but

okay so h6 i don't know what this is

this is a weird move we're just gonna

chase the knight away i've never seen

this before

but we're going to give her the benefit

of the doubt 5 000 bits fidius gage holy

smokes

oh my lands girl bishop g7 okay

knight e5 okay uh fine

he's just shuffling his knight or a

knight c4

so this is a good um this is a good time

for me to practice what i preach

when our opponent does weird stuff like

that i'm not gonna change my strategy

i'm just gonna play normal moves i'm

just gonna develop my pieces

and let's let him die by his own sword

okay he's trolling so the knight on a5

let's apply

natural concepts is undefended what can

we do

our queen x-rays the knight that's

something you guys should see

so we can go c5 open up the attack on

the knight and

contest the center we're going to take

on d4 and we're going to very quickly

occupy the center with our pawns

yeah i don't like it when people do this

because that often means they start

playing really well at some point now

we're going to develop the knight and

sack the queen

some of you may have noticed that the

bishop x-ray is the queen but we

wouldn't have had a good discover check

okay queen on a4 how do we exploit it

what should we do

what should we do all right guys no

innocent until proven guilty right now

he's playing terribly

if he starts playing brilliantly i will

let you know e3

okay let's just wait and see so uh

you know we're gonna play normally here

uh there's many ways that we can

go about playing this uh the default

should be to just activate your pieces

so we're going to activate the rook and

put it on the semi-open file

where it basically pressures the c2 pawn

and uh we're going to see how he

responds to the queen h4

get out of here get out get out and get

out of that get out of here

a non-smurf yeah anon would totally be

doing this queen to c4

okay um well

he's trying to confuse me but you know

it's very important thank you phineas

once again let's go 95 to centralize the

night

we're going to keep improving our pieces

marginally eventually something's going

to manifest itself now we're going to

bring the bishop into the game with

bishop f5

and we're going to tuck it away on g6

potentially

okay now this night on c3 you guys see

that night right

we want to make sure that night is gone

what should we do

we use our knight and we put it on e4

but let's focus on the game guys it

doesn't matter that he's trolling

this is good practice because you're

gonna you're gonna play people who are

like that

okay knight to b5 it's actually not that

easy to

refute his moves i i know that sounds

crazy let's get our queen into the game

let's get the big boys into the game

let's get the big boys into the game now

we're gonna park our bishop back on g6

yeah he's actually not playing that

belly i mean it's he's he's not

blundering anything

okay now he's attacking our knight we

gotta move our knight back back to c5

yeah i know it sounds absurd but he's

actually not blundering and now he's

playing well h4 is a good move

he's undermining our pawn

now what should we do here well what i'm

noticing here is the knight on b3 right

let's send our pawn into a5 let's try to

attack that knight

get it out of b3 so that the queen could

reinforce its attack on i don't like

this

one bit ladies and gentlemen but we'll

see

um we're still i mean black is better

here i you know knight takes c5 okay so

what should we take with

what should we take this

so i can take with a bunch of pieces i

can take with a rook

but let's take with the pawn to chase

away his knight his knight is his only

good piece

so using logic we're gonna take with a

pawn but knight p5 would be a good move

here

that one i actually didn't quite

anticipate

okay let's slice off the connection

to his knight with a pawn holy smokes 10

bucks thank you so much

ethan olden appreciate it okay he

defends the knight

um let's get a rook into the game let's

get our last remaining piece into the

game of the lookout to d8

and we are already setting up a

potential knight sacrifice on d3

okay so he goes knight d4 so one thing

that i would consider doing here

if from a gm level is actually to

sacrifice the knight this is dania's

style

i'm not gonna do quite as much

explaining as i usually do because i'm

a little bit bemused okay let's go

knight d3 check sacrificing the night

why do i do this because

i feel like i have so many active pieces

that this has to work

look at all of my pieces in the game

we've talked about the scenario before

okay so what should we do now

hmm this knight is the annoying piece

this knight is the annoying piece i'll

give you guys a hint

let's get this knight out of the picture

e5

we could have taken with the bishop but

i don't want to give away my really nice

bishop

okay ah that's a very good move though

because eddie he wants to play e4 and he

wants to lock things up he sacrifices

back the piece

and he wants to lock everything up

that's a really strong idea now we're

going to bring the rook up to defend the

pawn on g5

we're going to bring the rook up to

defend the pawn on g5 i think i'm still

doing fine here

queen to e2 okay

um let's double on the c file

let's double on the c file

[Music]

and now um let's uh let's snag the pawn

let's

snag the pawn on b2 all right guys relax

everybody

queen to a2 he attacks our queen we move

our queen away

and now um well

i think we can take another pawn queen

takes a four

okay uh now i think that we can uh

hmm what should we do here

well i think that one thing we can do is

we can uh we can try to trade rooks we

can try to create a pair of bricks get

his active rook

out of its active square i did kind of

blunder the pawn but that's a

worthy price to pay for getting us rid

of his activities he of course takes it

uh yeah uh hmm now let's get our rook to

an open

file rook b7

okay f4 makes a lot of sense

okay queen a3 i'm gonna try to set this

up

okay what is this oh bishop d2

of course okay well i can drop my bishop

back that's okay

f6 oh my god rook h7 and e5 yeah

well you guys can see the difference you

know when okay but bishop g5 wait a

minute

let's not give up yet i want to take on

i want to take on d2 i don't see a

defense for him

i don't see a defense for him rook

here check

mmm wait a minute this is unclear

actually i might be winning

no something is up but i don't know what

it is exactly queen d6 e5

oh my god and if he takes and he's got

is he checkmating me there

oh my god that's ridiculous actually

let's play king f8 let's get the king

out

no no 2700 plays like this guys

i don't know the other thing is some

people play like this they psych me out

queen h5 is an amazing move because he

wants e5

but i can give him a check

i gotta try to flag him here king g4

oh my god damn girl

now he's got this check and he wins

oh my god yes and queen f7 three seconds

on that move

and then three seconds e5 oh hi

e5 oh my god it's hilarious

[Music]

rook c8 and bishop d8 is mate

oh my god that's so funny guys i mean

this guy is actually hilarious

oh my god he blunted her up wait i think

he turned it off

oh my god no it's me holy smokes

it's actually mate he wins king c7 he

had bishop f4 and he thinks in this

position

oh my god that's actually so funny guys

okay let's i gotta practice what i

preach

we're not gonna report him we're gonna

look with stockfish

a point i wanna make to everybody how do

you deal with something like this before

you report anybody

we have to leave the possibility that i

was so psyched out by this

that he made a bunch of mistakes and i

thought they were computer moves because

we had made up our minds so let's first

look with chess base and our real stock

fish

obviously what makes this suspicious is

the fact that he crushed me

out calculated me and he

uh he did it after a horrible opening

when he was lost

not a lot of people could do that but uh

we have to leave that possibility open

so let us um

practice that and look at the game

obviously um it is he made it extremely

extremely obvious what he was doing

but we have to practice innocent until

proven guilty

it's magnus would not play like this

that's what you guys need to understand

it

it's not about oh this guy could be

magnus it's the playing style

the playing style is what makes this the

most improbable it has nothing to do

with

oh if it was magnus then he could play

like this magnus doesn't play like this

look guys

you understand what i'm saying yeah and

that's a very typical technique that new

people have been doing which is to play

nonsense moves at the start

to evade the automated suspicion because

it will show a very low accuracy

because he played terribly at the start

you understand what i'm saying

and then once he starts doing it um

then he's quote unquote evaded suspicion

what he doesn't realize is he's playing

me

okay so i've i've set up the scene yeah

so danny has talked about it but

basically

five bucks thank you easy now we knew

that we would uh we would encounter

these kinds of people and

and and that's okay okay let me just um

so i don't actually think i played badly

either that's the funny thing i think i

played quite well

okay so you guys now can see stockfish

okay so let's look at stockfish

92 is really good okay

so let's go from this position so he's

minus three which is winning

rook c8 quinn h4 queen c4 okay let's

start here

let's start here queen e2

knight c3

knight v5 is top look at this knight b5

guys

knight 5 d4 is second f3

is fine although h4 is

basically top eight this is a mistake hg

and knight takes c5

is second yep no that's first now first

or second

knight b5 a4 is first or second

we're gonna go by the top two moves

because he could use a slightly

different computer

oh you know he's losing here i'm

actually winning i actually came very

close to beating him

so and this was a mistake e5 was a

mistake i should have gone rook c2

bishop d3 is top e4 stop

queen e2 bishop d2

king f2 is top top

top top

i don't know

f6 is top though rook h7

rook h5 is top okay yeah he definitely

cheated

quinn h5 is top top bishop g5

and now he had this smurf move brook b8

yeah so basically he he he went on and

off like he made some moves on his own i

came very close to beating him

nonetheless

i missed one big chance here um

i made i missed one big chance your rook

c2 would have been very strong

yeah i just didn't realize that this was

winning but obviously uh

681 volt yeah no no it's obvious that he

cheated

uh i won't even pretend to have any

suspicions

we'll report him um

and uh this is yeah he made it he made

it very very obvious

with three seconds of move and how he

played in the end that's what makes it

obvious

yeah three seconds per move is also what

uh what does it okay

i'll write them a personal message sorry

guys did you have to sit through this

i hope that i have been reasonable and i

hope i didn't make the accusation in an

unfounded manner i've shown my method

uh to be very clear the reason that i am

confident that he cheated consists of

several things

the first is that he played a terrible

opening followed by

an abundance of computer moves and

critical moments three seconds per move

and mainly i would not have been uh

convinced

had we not seen his play in the final

stage of the game this is where he

started playing topmost

look at his time four seconds four

seconds

five seconds one second four eight

seconds

seven seconds four seconds 20 seconds on

the best move four seconds on king q4

four four four four it's the typical

sign in rook ba nobody would ever play

this move

he knows that it's winning but he gives

up the rook

just to kind of smurf the engine okay

no it's not possible trust me on this

one

okay that is unfortunate um that this

happens

but um yeah so i was winning with rick t

now i knew this would be sketchy too

once he played knight g5 you already

know

something's gonna be wrong

maybe

and unfortunately yeah we knew we knew i

knew too but i have to

i have to give people the benefit of the

doubt you know

i can't make any conclusions

[Music]

now and before i get off the soapbox and

play one last one

i want to make one thing very clear

which is that if you guys

are playing a cheater i want to really

want to make this fleet from the bottom

of my heart

do try to give people the benefit of the

doubt not because i'm trying to be

holier than that but because

i co take take my word for it firsthand

uh to get accused of cheating when you

didn't cheat is

very frustrating very dangerous um and

and we want to make sure that

not as frustrated as you may be in the

frustration as human i feel that

that anger in my chest when i feel like

somebody's cheating it's terrible

uh but you do want to go by the evidence

and

you want to give the people the benefit

of the doubt uh and

and you know you have to understand that

sometimes the anger can come from a

normal place

but sometimes people truly can play well

and i'm not trying to garner any

you know any points for manuel he's so

moral but

i've made this mistake myself and uh i

feel like this is the best way to be

thank you twitch prime username

okay it really is innocent until proven

guilty and we have to practice that in

chess too

okay that's why i decided to show my

exact method

which is to check with stockfish and to

look at his time consumption

per move which is very very revealing

chess.com will do the rest

okay um well obviously the consequences

can be that you could falsely bend but

chess.com

is a great algorithm they don't do that

but that's just the mentality that i

advocate to everybody why not take

white bishop a few moves ago um

well if i took the bishop where oh you

mean here

well because if you take the bishop he's

got queen e5

followed by bishop b5 i mean the insane

thing

i mean all rook h5 is pretty insane

although it's understandable but to

realize that this is losing and this is

made it's crazy

and then king g4 instantly is is just

remarkable like windy six

oh wait i played this really good move

if you're a human you would calculate

king h2

i don't even know why you didn't play

this move king g4 instantly is

ridiculous

next game guys let's move on i think

we've all had our moment of fun

this will happen a couple of times uh in

the speed run and that it is what it is

okay let's go well twitch prime um

uh you know i'm perfectly calm just uh

you know yeah okay

so let's go up let's go on and i knew

that when a 2400 plays a 2000

that's already pretty sus to be good

that was a really good game king h2

queen d65

2258 thank you kalis kintodra

okay let's try another king's indian

let's try another king's indian

back to the game guys okay so we're

going to play the king's indian he plays

the fiance variation

he plays the fiance variation now i've

explained the main moves in the king's

indian many times

and in terms of where you develop this

knight

there's two possible squares c6 and d7

and one

important thing about playing the king's

indian at a high level the the move

knight c6

can sometimes backfire what is the

reason

what annoying response does white have

against knight c6

and that is the move d5 exactly so

knight bd7 is actually

very typical in the king's indian to

prepare e5 that knight is very safe

but i hear you guys saying well what

about the bishop on c8 we're going to

get that bishop

in due time and i'm going to show you

guys a really interesting line here we

go c6 to control the d5 square

and the other idea of the move c6 is to

deploy the queen to a5

this is my main line actually and at the

right moment we take on e5

and now we put the knight on e5 this is

all fury so i'm going a little bit fast

but every one of these moves i hope is

understandable too now we attack the c4

button and pressure his center

as you guys can see this is a hyper

modern opening because he's got a lot

more of the center than i do

but look at how i'm attacking both of

his pawns with my pieces this night

pressuring that pawn

this night pressuring that pawn and what

the battle is going to revolve around

here is

whether or not he's going to be able to

beat

back my initiative now we need to deploy

our rook to e8

in order to prepare to increase the

pressure on the e-pawn

if we want him to play f4 that's a move

a lot of people would play automatically

could somebody explain to me the

drawback of the move f4

okay um let's move on we'll do that

after the game

let me write this down okay

so now what we need this knight on d4 is

very active

can we try to compel him to get this

knight out of the picture

and we also accomplish a secondary goal

of increasing the pressure on the e pawn

and we also develop a piece so we do a

lot of things now c5 guys would be a

very common mistake

c5 would weaken the d5 square very

significantly

okay c5 would weaken the d5 square let's

find a slightly more subtle method of

doing it

well queen c5 ooh queen c5 is actually a

really good move

oh yeah yeah guys we're moving on wait a

minute i actually saw something really

cool

let me think

let's do this this is a very tricky move

guys

i thought of bishop e6 initially bishop

e6 was what we wanted to play initially

but now

somebody suggested this move i really

like it queen c5

now what is the idea i'm posing a thread

i'm x-raying f2 what are we specifically

50 bucks off season cornbread so glad

that it's helping you thank you so much

for the 50.

the bomb ladies and gentlemen from

cornbread we're threatening queen takes

d4 and knight f3 how did i see that

how does my brain spot that quickly well

the key sign guys when the bishop when

he's played g3 and the bishop is not

fianchettoed

that's a warning sign in your med

tactical metal detector

okay when the move g3 has been played

but the bishop has left its fiancee

square

the f3 square is often the source of

tactics and i'll show you guys after the

game

a really beautiful idea in this line

where that is applied

okay that's just a little thing to kind

of remember he actually

is doing a good job thinking here

because he's in pretty big trouble i

think

well let's see what he does

he's not lost but he's in trouble

well if this should be three then okay

ladies and gentlemen queen takes d4 and

the game is over

okay

so yep

now um this is the fianchetto variation

so queen a5 is actually the move that i

play as my main move

if we look in chess base uh

i will practice what i preach uh and

that's the fundamental

motivation here if we look if we do a

search on this position

in chess space and uh let me go into the

chess-based scene if we go into the

chess base scene and sorry guys i keep

doing this but

you guys can see

that i've played it twice i've actually

played it more through different move

orders but i have a couple of games in

the database in this line

and that actually is my main line

against the fiance i won a nice game

here against ivan key

and i've played it for many years the

dude closed his account there we go

so back to uh the game just wanted to

show you

so essentially the queen is deployed to

a5

now 95 attacks the pawn on c4 we go

rookie 8 to deploy the rook now here's

the line

if white goes bishop e3 here then we go

bishop e6

attacking the pawn trade and in this

position

i have many times encountered uh the

move a3 even anatoly karpov

all right guys moving on please moving

on all right this just is a thing

and it's only carpool into this i've

done this a million times black to play

and find a beautiful idea and the way

that you see this idea

is to spot the f3 score yes he closes

account guys but moving on please

black to play right queen b5

who sees it bingo battal for president

knight takes e4

i'll gift you a sub for that knight

takes c4 queen takes e1

knight f3 check is a four brilliant

tactic and knight takes e1 and at the

end of the day black's going to be up in

exchange

because if you take the knight i take

this knight

beautiful isn't it that's actually part

of the reason i like this movement five

believe it or not even if white plays f4

this is one of the main lines

black can still go knight takes c4 and

if f takes e5 knight g3 leads to

absolute chaos so to show this again a3

our idea is to get the queen on a

forkable square

okay that has to make sense for you guys

to follow this

the point is that if the queen ends up

on d2 or e1

we will be able to fork the queen how do

i know that this exists because once

again the bishop is not on its fiance

square

which means that the move g3 has now

weakened the f3 square

in order to get the queen in a forkable

square we open the gates i call this

like opening the gates

we distract the knight from c3 and we do

that in order to now

sacrifice our queen for the rook

boom now the queen is on a forkable

square our metal detectors go off

because the king and the queen are

unfortunate squares knight f3 check

king has to move we take the queen but

that's not the end of the story right

now if we count the pieces we have two

rooks

and two pieces against one rook and

three pieces so we're up in exchange

he would have had two pieces for a rook

but remember that his knight is now

hanging due to our rook being on e6

all right i've done this many times in

blitz games so remember four cribble

squares

and then distraction sacrifices yeah so

if after knight takes e4 he goes b4

then we can take on c3 and attack his

queen okay

glad you guys enjoyed it now the main

line by the way in this position for

that reason is to bring the king up

so king g2 would be a better way to do

what he did if he goes king g2 that

would be

that would have been a better idea king

h2 seems to defend against that

no no g3 is not bad but but this move

it doesn't actually solve the problem it

just makes it equally bad

okay and that's why we played queen c5

so why couldn't he take my queen with

his queen because it's the same exact

concept knight f3 check

and we win his queen back and we're up a

piece this came from the fiance

variation of the king's indian which is

by the way a very good variation if you

play it well

king h1 would be also good uh king each

one would be the same idea but this

would leave the f2 pawn unattended

so the move queen c5 could still be

considered here that's why king g2 is

good

because the king simultaneously defends

all these coupons

well i think he thought i think that he

thought he was somehow defending against

uh certain ideas he just didn't think

this through he didn't realize that the

square was still undefended

he should have gone bishop e3 and at

least given up a pawn and at least he

can continue to play although this is

terrible because white has also given up

his fiance bishop

well nanuka queen b6 doesn't pose the

secondary threat of attacking the pawn

so here white could even slide his king

to g2 and we can't take

that pawn don glover thank for the prem

what was the purpose of knight a4 if he

hadn't played queen takes d4 well he was

attacking my queen

you know he wanted my queen out of c5

which is understandable

i think you just failed to detect that

this was a threat

all right

glad to hear that shikhar thank you all

right guys i'll give you guys one more

encore game i'm pretty high energy right

now for some reason

i love doing this this gives me a lot of

energy as does the support

of everybody here another thank you for

the 50 bucks from off season cornbread

we got 500 bits on top of it from

fenvine gold

amazing okay

no i play knight bd7 as my full-time

line i love john

i love fed um but

you know i've played the king's indian

my whole life i still play it

knight bd7 is in pretty good theoretical

shape right now

yeah my book on positional chess is out

of print i'll try to investigate that

let's go

i'm i am high energy right now dude this

is

these hours is what i live for well
