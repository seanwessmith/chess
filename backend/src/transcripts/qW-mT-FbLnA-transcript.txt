okay let's go let's get back in the ring charlie huertas from the philippines 1580. let's play the sicilian defense and he plays the aleppin citilion named after simone alepan i'll talk about him later what is the purpose of the alpine city and the purpose is to control the center with d4 we need to preempt white from going before we don't want to let him control the entire center how can we do that how can we preempt white from controlling the set how can we do it first what can we do yeah we can go e5 that's fine but e5 if you guys may notice weakens the d5 square and that kind of i don't want to create a big weakness on a central square like that let's go d5 and it is true okay he goes e5 again he wants to play d4 so we're gonna play d4 ourselves to stop him from doing that our pawn is sort of wedged here it's stopping him from naturally controlling the center we've got a nice position i'll talk about this opening a little bit later bishop b5 we already kind of know how to respond to this type of move what should we do how should we deal with the fact of this pin being kind of annoying again not all of our pieces always need to be conquering you know the greek or the okay d3 is a very typical mistake i need somebody i'm not going to give you any hints black to play and win how do i see this two things number one undefended pieces loose pieces drop off number two as soon as a move is made in front of the king even tangentially you must look at the diagonals that have been opened and consider whether you cannot put a piece on those diagonals when a a5 wins a piece and this basically wins the game because knight c3 we take remember we have a pawn on d4 that's why we put it there right it's all good no but normally you'd be right zaizi and he's fuming right now i'm telling you boom we're also attacking three different pawns let's take one of them let's take oh we should have taken b2 because we would have probably also won the rook uh but i i was just too attracted by the juicy central pawn on d3 okay now what do i always tell you guys when we win a lot of material when we win a lot of material what do you not want to forget to do what do you not want to forget to do no not trade develop develop your pieces when you want material do not forget about that trading and i talked about this at the very beginning of the speed run it's good in general trading is good when you're up material but two things to point out it's not the only way to convert a material advantage you can also use your material to attack i call this sort of method one and the other thing is that people get in a lot of trouble by the way just defending the pawn people get in a lot of trouble when you go out of your way to trade pieces you don't want to your entire position solely for the purpose of trading one pair of pieces if a trade falls in your lap as as these trades are here sure go ahead and trade a bunch of pieces fine but but not if you have to your position somehow just for the sake of one trade so here for example the trades are literally falling in our lap he's offering us to take the bishop queen to c3 basically forces the queen trade in fact ladies and gentlemen we have kind of a nice move here how do we get this queen out of d6 we can basically trap it we can go queen c5 but let's look for something even better boom knight f5 get back to b4 forcing the trade we win the game okay all right queen before we take it and now the same rules remain in the end game we don't want to forget to consolidate do we need this one we don't need the spot we don't need the spawn let's deploy our bishop to the most active square and what should we do now in the interest of things that i explained can somebody tell me a good move in this position we can again if a trade falls in your lap yeah and everybody's suggesting good moves king e7 is great increasing the coordination between the pieces castling is not as good in the end game because there's no need to castle we can do the same thing as we would when we castle by putting our king on e7 which is closer to the center now we got to be very careful bishop b7 would run into a nasty little check on c7 how do we circumvent that we can just drop it to d7 right we force the rook trade the game is over okay infiltrating infiltrating we're going to just start picking off his pawns how do we convert this position we identify the area where we can create a pass pawn and then we create one either by taking a bunch of our opponent's pawns or by pushing our pawns and just creating a password i this there's no rocket science here right i'm literally doing as i say i'm going to create a pass pawn and i'm going to use my extra material the extra bishop to force white's rook away he's probably gonna go rook b3 yep so no problem let's defend the pawn of the rock now where should we put our bishop to dislodge the rook from b3 yeah just let's go here bishop c6 bishop d5 b3 the fact of the matter is we have so much extra material that we can use it to continually get this rook out of its blockading post that's just how you usually win these types of positions not the only way boom b2 is very formulaic then bishop b4 it's the same thing repeated again and again until his rook has to permanently move away or give itself up for the plot and then we're going to have a rook extra okay identify a passport yeah well sometimes you sometimes you see a specific pass pawn that you can create sometimes you see the general area of the board where a passpond can be created but you don't know exactly which pass pawn it's going to be okay goodbye that's over yeah this is not the only way to convert this again i want to make it very clear that when i'm winning like this there's a million possible moves on every move uh there isn't just one way of doing this i'm just trying to show the most sort of play it by the rules by the book way of converting same thing by the way we're just going to create a pass pawn we're going to push it even though i'm up a million pieces we could literally we don't have to push any of our pawns i can move my king up and checkmate him but the easiest is just going to be to push the pawn forget don't forget about not stalemating that's why and there we go 1600 ladies and gentlemen and uh this is a great place to stop but let's take a quick look at the game first okay so the elephant sicilian is named after jimon alopin who was a lithuanian chess master from i believe the early 20th century uh and who was the first to play the elephant thank you trash pandaman for the sub let's take some bets who thinks that that aleppin shimon alepan was the first person to play the alpine let's get a yay who thinks that alpine was the first person to play an alpine no he was not the first person to play an elephant he was the fourth person sorry the fifth person to play the elephant but he was one of the earliest proponents of it the first person to play the alpine was a in in recorded modern recorded history was a guy named william popert in london in 1841 he played it against howard staunton one of the strongest players of the 19th century and beat him with the alpine then it was played in 19 in 1842 by john william shulton another very strong english player but got crushed and only in 1898 was it played by alepan himself so as i've made clear before some of these openings are named after people but that doesn't mean those people were the first people to play them sometimes they never even played the opening named after them as in the case of the philidor the philidor is named after philidor but he never actually played it i think he just talked about it in his book but it's kind of interesting how this kind of chess naming stuff works the damiano is often named after damiano this is a horrible move and i've shared this story many times damiano a 17th century chess master wrote one of the first books ever on chess and he refuted the damiana but we don't call it damiano's reputation like who is this dummy damiano he was the one who actually said it was bad uh and and yet we think it was the city of damiano who wanted to play f6 so it's just interesting how this kind of stuff works but we played d5 and he played a weird move e5 um e takes d5 is the main move now what is the what is the reason why uh this is better than a scandi well if you look very carefully at this position you compare it to a scandi who can tell me what the main difference is uh with the insertion of these moves like wha what move does yeah knight c3 is not possible and as you guys know that's often one of the key indicators for whether a queen is safe in the center can he develop the knight and attack the queen simultaneously and here the answer is no i played the alpine myself as my main opening for many years there is a theoretical line that goes like this and this is a very interesting opening i mean it's it's not clear who's better uh it's a very rich rich position which i will not go into right now but um this is you know the movie five he wants to transpose into some sort of a french but we stopped him from doing that right we went we wedged the pawn through to d4 and then his key mistake was d3 uh which which allows of course this fork against his bishop what should he have done if he castled we actually have another nice tactic in this position oh but there's some beautiful counter tactics the bishop on b5 what can you tell me about it i'm defended remember what i said about pins they go both ways either side can exploit a pin it's like a two-sided coin how can we exploit the bishop on b5 we can do knight takes e5 this is a very typical idea it's a bit you're like did you just say it's a very typical idea have you personally daniel of you personally applied this idea in one of your games if you personally applied what do you guys think yes i have in fact i can show you the very game in which uh this position this type of tactical this is a very very typical tactic uh it truly is and um i'm stalling because i'm loading up the game and trying to do it as fast as possible i just managed to do it and uh there we go okay so i had a game in 2010 where something very similar happened i was playing an im and my opponent played bishop g5 in this position the bishop here isn't strictly speaking undefended it is protected by the queen but if you look at this very carefully i've got two pieces that are sort of x-raying that bishop and so knight takes d5 happens the same knight that captures the pawn is guarding the bishop which is very important because if i could not take back with the knight here i would lose the knight and uh here you could just take with a knight and i'm up a pawn and if he takes on d5 then obviously i play bishop takes g5 and i'm up a pawn so very similar tactical idea so this is quite typical but the problem here is if you calculate a little bit further what you'll see is that after knight takes e5 bishop takes b5 black is very poorly i mean i'm not developed what move and white is a very nasty move here which wins the game for white again the bishop is undefended square on f7 you have to pay attention to this boom fork attacking the bishop and attacking f7 this shows the importance of always having to calculate as far as possible a lot of people are falling in love with knight f7 this would be worse remember the piece of advice i shared earlier if you have a two move sequence one move two moves you want to consider both move orders because sometimes you only consider one move order you forget that by making the second move first you greatly increase the effectiveness of that operation so queen b3 would actually win the game it would win the bishop or it would deliver checkmate and so uh if he had castled we probably should have gone e6 and just continued our development okay uh the idea behind knight f7 is a z could be either queen h5 or queen b3 i think both moves are quite equivalent you could win the bishop this way or you could win the bishop this way but the net result of it is the same the king is out in the open black is worse but it's a question of how much worse here black is completely lost so this is this is crushing and that's just part of why chess is a cruel game you know sometimes you can see a lot more than your opponent our opponent may have even missed the move knight takes e5 but this kind of tactic falls into his lap that's one of the things that always concerns me when i'm playing quite you know weaker players is i might see a lot more than them but i'm gonna have to choose a path at some point and a tactic like this could be low-hanging fruit so you know that's part of the equation um okay uh so so that's basically how that happened and after we won the piece the rest was very simple we should have taken b2 of course i forgot that the spawn was on d4 usually bishop c3 is possible but here it's not and uh his only way to save the rook is to give up the knight and that gives up a second piece uh and like that time i got my queen trapped exactly that's a great example of that so here we just traded all the pieces defended what needed to be defended forcing the queen trade giving up the pond to trade more pieces bringing the bishop to beast to d7 not b7 allowing this and uh identifying the area of the board where we can create a pass pawn creating a pass pawn using our extra piece to dislodge the rook cooperating rook and bishop again create a pass pawn push it and he resigns simple textbook play it by the rules can be very effective yeah let's go okay so let's go e4 as we have been customarily doing okay knight c6 that's the nimzovich defense uh d4 is possible here another good move is knight f3 um and yeah so he goes d5 so this is like a souped-up version of the skandy our response is no different than it would be in the scandy so what should white do here how how do we usually play in this candy like what what are the next two moves actually just knight c3 is correct and then d4 okay queen h5 yeah this is um it's actually kind of a dangerous system okay so d4 yeah this is what aquila plays by the way one of my close friends in mods and uh this actually is an opening that we we have to respond very accurately to now um black's idea is is to very quickly pile up on the d4 pawn okay and for that reason he's putting all of he's putting all his eggs in one basket he's gonna castle and he's gonna basically have the equivalent of four pieces either directly or indirectly attacking the d4 pawn so the correct move in this position is to immediately go after the knight on c6 this is just theoretical knowledge and i will explain this properly after the game but it's not an intuitive move because it allows uh bishop takes f3 which kind of cripples the pawn structure but that's okay and i'll show you guys why uh d5 is the tempting move here but he castles and the rook then pins the queen i'll show this in detail after the game and let me remember yeah and now the move is queen to e2 and a bishop yeah again i this is a bit theoretical so uh delving into the details would require me to move the pieces around okay bishop b4 now we can sort of play based on our understanding he pins the other knight and this guy really goes after me and uh you know we need to defend first and foremost against against this pin and so we're going to do that by going bishop to d2 just preventing taking the sting out of this pin unpinning ourselves and um his the correct move for black would be knight gd yeah he's very good this guy has played the opening extremely well um and i should know this a little bit better this line let me think yeah so let's chase the bishop away first of all now let's let's make this bishop decide what it wants to do and it's good to ask your opponent questions in this regard you know like forcing your opponent to yeah let's let's chase the bishop away entirely and now the spawn is once again under some pressure so we're going to get this bishop out to e3 to protect that pawn to give it some support and um yeah no i i definitely we didn't play this particularly well well d4 is not hanging because remember that we're pinning the knight but he should castle here yeah and he's he's in very good shape in this position we're going to go rook d1 to try to defend upon he's going to go rook d8 no knight f5 is probably okay this is inaccurate and the reason this is inaccurate is because he leaves a particular piece unattended which piece does he leave unattended what can we take here to lessen the the immediate pressure on the pawn yeah we can take the knight and we also kind of double his pawns which i should have done much earlier and and now we need to discharge well we need to solve the problem of the spawn okay this pawn is bothering the hell out of me and the way to solve the problem of a weak pawn first and foremost is to ask yourself can i defend it with another pawn and um well the answer is yes you can defend it with a c pawn to defend it with a c pawn you have to move this knight now where should we move this knight well we should move it to a civilized square square where it's also doing something let's move it toward the center with knight to e4 and again this is a complicated position white is certainly not better here but um these are the kinds of positions where usually like 1600s really struggle yeah and that's a big mistake knight takes c4 is a very big mistake and that's a very typical mistake from from someone of his rating range which i'll explain afterward why is it a mistake because this knight on f5 that he had is actually a super strong piece and what he allows us to do is is solve the problem of the pawn right we take with the pawn and now look at his bishop it's biting at granite we didn't even need to play c3 and he's left with bishops he doesn't have a knight and a knight would be a great kind of screwdriver type of piece here and now he he tries to attack us but i've got enough beef here on the king's side in in the form of both knights he's also weak in the e5 square later maybe i could stick a knight there although most likely he's going to take this night with his bishop and uh well we can continue our development by castling we can finally castle our king f4 would be a good move here he's yeah he's this guy is vastly underrated and now we still have to play c3 because he's eliminated the defender of of the d4 pawn so we have to reinforce it again he's probably going to go here now the reason that i still like white's position here is because this bishop on b6 is terrible and it's buried it's completely buried it can't get out of the game the only way that it can get out of the game is if black orchestrates some sort of dastardly scheme with e5 so why does e5 work e5 may work because the bishop is exerting this pin over the case so what can we do to kind of prevent it to prevent e5 to take the sting out of it what can we do well we could go c4 but yeah c4 but that would weaken the d4 square let's just get let's just stick a queen there now there's a beautiful variation i have to show you guys let me not forget we could have moved our king to h1 uh and that's the sort of typical prophylactic mode but then there's a beautiful variation that i think would have actually landed that in quite a bit of trouble okay so he trades on f3 there's a lot to unpack in this game it's a very instructive game uh and and we have a lot of analyzing to do so i'm sorry for not explaining some of the key things here but trust me i'll go over them after the game and now he's worse he's made another very instructive mistake he's given up his strongest pair of pieces which were exerting pressure on our position and in his logic he's he's weakened our king side pawn structure but this is nothing that we can't deal with maybe we can just bring our king up and the king is nicely defending both weaknesses and he's left with a terrible bishop that's never going to enter the game because he can't enter it backwards and he can't enter it forwards the pawns are limiting it so now what we have to do is make sure that that black doesn't get anywhere so let's go rook to d2 to stop the queen penetration to c2 and r5 is a nice move we can't take the rook because of the pin but we can just drop the queen back to e4 we're starting to attack his weaknesses finally he attacks our rook but he blunders the pawn on e6 and his position has started to crumble his position has started to crumble he's got to go rook f7 otherwise we either take the rook now we can move our work out of the way and uh yeah this bishop is is what's gonna kill him uh he's basically playing down a piece and he's doing a great job of it and you know what the most instructive thing to do here is well actually we can just take the pawn we could have just traded all of the pieces because he would have been literally left with uh this bishop that is that is completely useless but as it stands we can win another pawn and he's probably gonna get his queen out and miss queen a8 which is checkmate nope yeah this guy is is just flat out good um not an easy win at all and uh but we're gonna take another one now he he nobly tries to involve his bishop the problem is by the time he activates his bishop the earth will have turned into a supernova and disappeared into the universe i mean he's losing all of his pawns we're gonna give him a nice little check to dislodge the king so that we can take g7 as well and yeah goodbye and this is just checkmate i mean well we're winning all of his pieces and yeah the bishop bishop is now active congratulations but i think he's uh and he watch him go bishop c7 that'll be hilarious he finally activates his bishop but he has no pieces left i think he's gonna resign oh planets don't turn into a supernova that's funny okay well it just takes an h4 i don't know why he's not resigning oh there we go here it comes here it comes here it comes all right get and now it's going to give itself up for the yep okay i have no idea where this man is playing just none zero let me just get our king up just don't stalemate the guy hmm okay he wants stalemate but he's not gonna get it one order of stalemate coming up okay that was a really rich game actually uh so and i know that to some people it can be annoying that we spend a long time on the games and stuff but that's my job here again i i need to if there's a particularly instructive game i owe it to everybody to really explain everything as best i can because that's why we're doing the speed run uh and if so okay so queen h5 right uh bishop so i think that okay i think my mistake actually i'm not actually sure where my mistake was because i'm pretty sure this is the theoretical move now a couple of things in this position uh the move d5 is extremely tempting because it looks active you're attacking the knight but but the problem is that he castles and okay in a certain sense we've bitten off more than we can chew because well you can't take the knight because you lose the queen and that might not seem like a problem right okay big deal i can just develop my bishop but but look at what happens he plays e6 and and white does not have the the manpower necessary to just defend this pawn i mean you just lose the central pawn because of this incredibly nasty pin the plaque is exerting on the queen and um you know and you're just going to end up upon down for no compensation that's what makes this line very dangerous and actually a good weapon for people in this writing range now some other people were like okay i get it uh i get why not d5 but why why are you not why are you not cutting the effectiveness of this pin well the problem here is very similar black castles right and what's going on here look at this pawn on d4 very carefully how can black apply the most pressure to this pawn with this next move how can this is the reason why i didn't play like this this very nasty little move uh that that really puts this pawn under the microscope and well look at that i mean look at how much pressure there is on all aspects of white's position here and if you go d5 now again black doesn't need to move his knight from c6 and if white tries to unpin himself by moving the queen well again you lose the pawn so you know you're damned if you do and damned if you don't and this is a very nasty position uh so does this make sense to everybody and and i want i want this to make sense because it's important to understand how the mechanism of this opening so that's why i played bishop b5 because preemptively i'm trying to take this knight out of commission for two reasons first of all i'm discouraging him from castling why because he's gonna have to deal with a ruined pawn structure where his king is and that's nobody likes that uh and the second thing is that literally i mean if i take his knight then he's got one less piece attacking d4 but whoops sorry but uh somehow i mistimed the bishop takes c6 move and uh probably what i should have done is is just taken and developed my bishop and played this normally but i tried to be fancy i played queenie too uh and the idea behind this move is to preemptively unpin myself so i'm preemptively counteracting the effectiveness of him putting a rook onto it that's no longer going to pin the queen that used to be on d1 and also i'm uh potentially angling for one of these squares to apply more pressure on the knight but he goes bishop before pinning me the other way uh and somehow like white just doesn't have again the resources necessary to to defend against all of these criss-crossing pins so can you explain why the ruined pawns on the king side aren't a big deal yeah exactly so i should yeah we should take the knight now um but but i tried to delay this and honestly i missed 97. i i forgot that he can get his knight into the game and simultaneously support his other knight so that if we take uh that the effectiveness of that is completely nullified because now one knight has replaced the other um and and i mistimed bishop takes c6 now a couple of people are wondering okay i get it why am i not afraid of bishop takes f3 why is this pawn structure not to be feared and there is two things first of all i've often talked about how pawn structure is not the most important factor for evaluating the position and let me make one very important clarification i mentioned earlier that black's pawn structure being ruined near black's king is disastrous why is that the case and why do we not care as much about the pawn structure on white scent so i introduced an analogy imagine two houses houses are both in a very bad state of repair olds and they're collapsing but in one one house is abandoned and the houses next door are also abandoned and it's a matter of time before the house collapses and eventually the house does collapse and it causes damage to the surrounding streets and surrounding houses and that's not good uh but in the other house there's like a huge family that lives there and if the house collapses it causes death and it's a tightly packed community and it impacts the houses next door and the people there are impacted so pawn structure is completely relative to what's going on on that side of the board black's king queenside pawn structure is like that house where people live uh and because it's ruined it's a lot easier to access black's king but if you look at white spawn structure why can't just castle queenside why can decide to live on the other side of the board and the worst thing that's possibly going to happen in regards to this pawn structure is that uh well black might win one pawn big freaking whoop he's gonna win one pawn okay that's not the end of the world uh sometimes it is but not in this specific instance okay what is the worst thing that could happen for black checkmate black could get checkmated in like two moves okay so when you were evaluating pawn structure you have to understand two main things pawn strike pawn structure tends to be a particularly important phenomenon under two conditions first is that there is a king next to the pawn structure that has been impacted number two is that you're close to an end game in pawn end games pawn structure is crucial because it determines which side has the easier time creating a past one right uh and but but in a normal middle game like a dub pair of double pawns is just not nothing to fret over in most cases that doesn't mean it's not important that doesn't mean it doesn't need to be factored in but hopefully this makes some sense and that's basically the reason why we're not afraid of bishop f3 okay even if we didn't get a chance to take on c6 i wouldn't really mind black taking on f3 hopefully that makes sense okay that was a little out there but um you know what what ended up happening is that we didn't get a chance to take his knight and so he was able to sort of extend the pressure on this pawn uh without us being able to lessen it by taking the night it was a whole idea of bishop e5 and knight f5 was the first inaccuracy because he allowed us now to take the knight and and ruin his pawn structure and bury his bishop which is a lot more important by the way than his pawn structure being ruined again it's not the pawn structure itself that's important here it's the fact that it buries his bishop in the self-made prison uh and what should he have done how should he have exerted pressure on the spawn instead of knight five well e5 would be e5 would be like throwing out the baby with a bathwater maybe you were you're allowing te but um or d5 but rookie d8 and then maybe double rooks right it's not rocket science and then at the right moment you take on f3 and you do that because you win the pawn so it's as simple as that now the second mistake if you're a 1600 listen up because this is in my opinion i don't i don't mean to sound condescending i true i'm passionate about getting this out there because i think it could help people i mean at any level and this is the concept of prematurely you know okay how should i say this without people interpreting this the wrong way but by releasing the tension or prematurely trading pieces you can call it a million different things but it's this tendency to go for a clarified position or a forced line rather than keeping the tension on the board okay and you see this all the time like you have a trade that could be made to clarify the position and people just do it but every single trade has to be evaluated very very carefully and a trade like this one has the capacity to change the course of the game completely it's it's not just oh i take a bishop or a knight whatever okay this could completely derail the progress that black has been making and it does because what it what this move does is it it absolves me of the need to defend the d4 pawn black's knight was basically the only piece that could exert serious pressure on my position and in fact the ironic thing is what would be black's correct move here and i say ironic because it's actually not to take the bishop but to do something useful with the knight what did he have done he could have redirected the the pressure onto my knight and if i allow knight takes f3 my position collapses so knight g3 was what i plan to do but white is hanging by a thread here you can take this pawn and i'm attacking his queen so if he takes my knight you get a mass liquidation and i'm upon down here but again his bishop is buried so that's what's important but i realize now that that he's got queen h3 and now he's really getting to my king and guess what piece is at the middle of all of this it's the knight so uh so for that reason knight takes e3 was actually a very very uh disastrous mistake and he's still doing okay here uh but without this bishop his position is is very very very difficult and uh we won sim okay so here we stop we stop him from going e5 and exploiting the pin by the way the beautiful line you guys ready for a jaw dropping idea if we go king h1 what i didn't like is that he can go e5 anyway and we you could look at this and say wait isn't that the entire reason that we went king h1 so that we could take the pawn well yes but watch this now he takes the knight now it turns out that we can take with a pawn but the natural recapture would be rook takes f3 could somebody find black's idea here okay this is not like crazy but it's kind of nice boom goes the dynamite and guess what piece is behind it all bishop on b6 which has been activated and rook h4 checkmate that's i think there's a name for this it's like the it's not the arabian made it's not anastasia's made it's some version of the two and that's what i didn't want to allow so that's why we simply put a piece on the e5 square blockading that square entirely and and the rest was very simple the rest was a matter of consolidating defending our weaknesses stopping the queen from infiltrating and then eventually picking up the pieces that start to crumble because black did not hold everything together because he's playing down a piece um okay so that's basically how we won so the key moment in the game really was in the beginning me not taking on c6 and delaying that for too long allowing 97 and then him going knight of five big well not a big mistake but knight takes e3 and this was the big mistake and it doesn't you can look at this game quickly and you can gloss over this moment entirely because it looks like a completely innocuous trait but positionally speaking it's it's a disaster um are you playing the best moves which you would actually play in a game for the most part yes i'm actually playing full strength i'm making some decisions uh to simplify the game but not many so basically i'm playing my normal strength and that's an ambitious you know project i'm trying to explain my moves but i'm not really modifying my play style you
