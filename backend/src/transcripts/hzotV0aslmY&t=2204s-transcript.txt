[Music] okay so we got an 800 and we're gonna play e4 as always please save your questions until after the game ends and we have a scandi okay we have a scandy which we have not had yet now the scandi is not a bad opening per se but at this level we've talked about the fact that it's very difficult to play of course knight c3 is the move developing with tempo and now black has several um several retreats he goes queen back to d8 how do we continue to play what do we do what do we do we can develop our knight but let's occupy the center first by playing d4 so that he doesn't play e5 or c5 and goes knight c6 okay well he's attacking our pawn we could play d5 but we're trying to adhere to basic principles here so let's play knight f3 and defend the pawn while developing our knights now this is a situation where it's time to violate some principles that we have laid out we could absolutely continue developing but look at this knight on c6 he's moved to squeen around and about so many times that we actually can afford to bend some of the rules and really harass him a little bit because he hasn't developed any of his central pawns and there is a very clear drawback of that what can we do what can we do in this position ladies and gentlemen how do we punish the fact that he hasn't moved a single pawn in the center yeah d5 now can black take on d5 note we have two defenders and two attackers which means he cannot take on d well he does and see a lot of people just don't count the defenders and attackers of their same number of attackers and defenders and you cannot take the pawn because if you think about it the knight is an attacker but as soon as it takes the pawn it's no longer an attacker okay we're off a piece it's a perfect time to practice converting an advantage after the game i'll explain what happens after night before so let's develop our bishop and unpin ourselves as i talk about many times there's two ways a broadly speaking of converting a material advantage you can trade pieces or you can use that extra piece or whatever you have to attack but first and foremost before we even decide on a plan we need to complete our development okay a lot of people get in trouble because they forget that even though you might be up a piece fantastic job but you still need to complete your development you need to stick to fundamentals even though you might be up a piece now goes bishop c5 how do we play here where do you guys think that we should position this bishop and simultaneously perhaps follow up on one of these two methodologies carl marksmanship i completely agree bishop e3 is a great move let's disarm his bishop and we're not against the trade because we're up a piece if he takes and again guys please save your questions until after the game i promise to get to all of them what if he takes on e3 with his bishop do you guys see on the basis of our discussion of the two methodologies of converting a material advantage what should we take with riemann thinks we should take with the knight so what's the case for taking with the knight exactly yeah everybody's on the same page we force the queen trade essentially because we're simultaneously attacking the okay so he's just like he's counter-attacking our knight so in what order should we do things here what should we do like in what order should we do and what is it that we should even do and clutch too i guess your question will be answered so what do we do let's let's treat queens first let's get rid of this trade first let's trade queens although we don't have to do that we could have taken on g4 first but i'm trying to be as methodical as possible then we take knight takes g4 he has to take our knight boom we've traded queens we've won upon we're up a full piece and it's clear that we have now chosen the second method which is to trade as many pieces as possible without ruining any part of our advantage or our position so in the spirit of that that method what do we do how does white continue here we can play this move very safely rook t1 is good but why don't we first take the knight we have a chance for another trade does it ruin our position or make a concession nope to the contrary it ruins his pawn structure now let's go rookie to d1 trying to initiate a rogue trade now in such positions and we've talked about this before and he's doing our bidding for us it's a very good idea to invest a single tempo and make what kind of move let's move the night away and attack his pawn what kind of move is a really good idea in such positions to take care of our future self flight square makes space for the king we can do that in many different ways we don't have to always play only h3 we can already play f3 we can move the king out okay we don't have to do all that but first let's take the free pawn and i'm not saying we need to do that immediately okay so this is a great example of choosing how to make loft what does our opponent want and how do we prevent it and actually i'll give you guys a hint we don't even need to make luft we don't even need to make loft we can kill all of the birds with one stone by going to e this is a move you need to play very carefully right if it weren't for the pin he would checkmate us if we didn't have this move i would actually play king f1 in order to simultaneously guard against the threat of rookie two again every single move guys you're trying to accomplish as much as possible so it's and now i'm just gonna take the pawn and we're gonna win but it essentially when you have an idea do not play the first move that accomplishes that idea try to find the best way of accomplishing that so what do we do how do we win a position like this some people struggle with this what's going to be the plan the first thing in such positions my recommendation bring the king up first bring the king out then either promote upon or distract his king and promote a pun i'm going to talk a little bit about how to win such positions okay so this candy right now the main line in the scandi is queen a5 that's the traditional mainland queen d8 is a move an entire book has been written about this now he goes knight c6 which is already the first mistake and the first critical moment occurs here obviously everybody's wondering what the hell do we do if knight before happens um what do we do uh yeah i'll talk about that kasparov i actually missed that move but i think we have stuff we can do there's a couple of things that we can do here right um i like to move bishop to c4 to defend the pawn and then we can excommunicate that knight by playing a3 you guys might be but wait a minute he goes bishop f5 this is so annoying he's attacking the pawn at this point and this is a slightly higher level piece of advice we're already at 800. you have to distinguish between activity and pseudo activity pseudo activity is sort of a position which looks really really unpleasant but in reality it's all an illusion you can easily defend whatever your opponent is attacking and then push all of his pieces away in one fell swoop he is attacking c2 let's defend c2 by playing bishop b3 or even knight d4 although i don't really like the fact that this intercepts our protection of the pawn then we're going to play a3 and we're going to easily get rid of this bishop by playing knight t4 on the other hand black is a very very hard time getting his pieces out because e6 always runs into d takes e6 i actually like knight d4 the more i look at it we can even sacrifice this pawn for rapid development good job proper in fact if he takes the pawn because he's so undeveloped because his king is so locked in you need to be looking for tactics white has a devastating two move tactic that wins the game could somebody spot it please look at his king it has no squares yep riemann b should be five this would be checkmate we're not for c6 now we go knight takes c6 very straightforward takes takes he's got to give up the entire literal army i mean not only does he give up his queen but he gives up his knight and his rook and that is not a coincidence when you're this underdeveloped that is literally just what happens uh when you try to grab pawns rather than work more on your development that's kind of terrifying indeed um that's crazy so that's what would have happened had he played knight before now the funny thing here guys is that as kasparov points out i actually had missed the move e4 and what is the idea of the movie for the idea is if we move the knight back we'll look at this knight on d5 it's protected only by the queen so the queen is what we call overloaded it protects two pieces at the same time and it cannot keep its protection open for very long and black wins back to peace so how do we deal and this is i would say advanced right we're getting into advanced tactical territory i'm going to try to make this as clear as possible how do we deal with a situation like this well we need to reason very very methodically the first thing that we need to ask ourselves is can we move the knights and bishop there's probably a couple of good moves but i think i see one way to solve the problems can we move the knight and simultaneously attack bishop no actually that doesn't work so is there a way to move the knight inside the bishop at the same time could somebody tell me that and and defend the bishop at the same time yeah knight d4 but a lot of people would blitz this move out immediately think okay great so it takes takes our queen is no longer overloaded but the problem is we leave the d5 knight undefended and now if we take the bishop then black takes our knight and again black has recovered the piece so that doesn't work we need to look for alternate arrangements alternate solutions and kasparov indicates one so what we need to do here is ask ourselves okay so we know that we're probably losing a piece let's think about it another way does e4 make any weaknesses in his position does it allow any moves that were not possible before he played e4 now knight g5 i'm not sure what's attracting people about this guys because this is exactly the same thing as moving the knight back to e1 you lose a piece right that's exactly what i talked about so the movie forward is it creating any weaknesses does it allow any moves that would not have been possible with the pawn on e5 anything that you guys can spot particularly noting that the knight on d5 is super active beautiful bishop f4 now we're attacking c7 and this is a big deal if black takes we take on c7 and i'm gonna say that this is a little bit complicated because after king e7 we have to be extremely careful if we take the if we just gobble up the rook mindlessly then he plays f takes c2 it's a fork we have to trade queens the knight might not be getting out there's absolutely no need for these shenanigans this is why intermediate moves are so important do not rush to make a move such as knight takes eight ask yourself if there isn't something you can do first in order to eliminate all of these annoying nasty threats and it turns out if you think in that direction you know you quickly find that you can take the pawn with what with what can you take the pawn by the way this does not win a queen because of f6 always remember there might be a way to block your check think very carefully guys every tempo is important you actually take the pawn of the pawn you take the pawn with the pawn why why do you take with the pawn you could take with the bishop that's also good you're completely winning here but from a tactical perspective he would take with a pun whoa vladimir bellows raiding with the party of 44. thank you so much grandmaster uh valois a good friend of mine thank you so much uh new streamer i'll give him a follow because we are attacking simultaneously the bishop we're attacking both the bishop and the rook whereas if we take with the bishop aren't we also attacking a bishop from the rook well it's not that simple guys because now and and this also works just because we're attacking the king but from a tactical perspective he takes back and we have to attend to these threats if we take with the pawn he's got to attend to both the bishop and the rook and he's simply not able to do that simultaneously so how do we quantify this into a principle the principle that i would argue here is that if if there is a peace an opponent's piece that's hanging and we're thinking about making an intermediate move it's important to try to make that move with tempo so that he can't solve the problem of the initial piece so what can we say about this principle i hope i hope this makes sense to everybody so the movie 4 would have been very unpleasant but what's the lesson here the lesson is that when we're in a situation like this you're always looking for drawbacks even when things are not going well okay he's attacking two pieces when you can't find a direct solution you'll look for the drawback of your opponent's move and that can awaken you to moves that otherwise you just wouldn't have seen because you're too panicked okay um any other questions yeah bishop h3 the line goes on i want to pause there in that line because it gets really complicated and we're not quite at that level yet okay um any other question so tempo just means literally it is italian for time well it's managed for time a tempo is just like a move or it's how do i even define it it's a that's actually a good question how do we define tempo it's it's a single move i guess right it's the temporal value of a move okay so consider the difference between money and a dollar okay money is the concept itself money is time whereas a dollar is a single unit of it a tempo is the single chess unit right so it's like a single move when you gain a tempo you gain a move what does it mean to gain a tempo gain attempt means let's say you're attacking your opponent's piece your opponent has to move that piece and therefore he gives you one more move not the best definition but i think that gives you a good sense of it okay um so it's something that your opponent has to attend to which gives you which gives you a new move um which gives you an extra move rather not quite my tempo but it could also just mean um you know it could mean that in a more general sense i don't want to get into this too much because i'm going to try to explain this through the moves themselves continuing the game he blunders a piece okay so we play bishop e3 and at this point how do we decide between these two moves well we decide between these two moves because we see that if we take with a knight we basically force a queen trade we actually do not totally force a queen trade he can keep he can keep the queens on the board how how can black keep the queens on the board and save his bishop could somebody please explain to him how to to keep uh queen series one way but but the best is to play bishop back to d7 if you play queen c8 then white takes on g4 alarm bells ringing boom boom boom what do we do now what do we do now as soon as we see an x-ray this is a standard garden variety x-ray situation and we exploit that x-ray by moving the night out with maximal the maximal damage black knight takes c5 very good and that's it then we're gonna take the knight we're up a piece we have the e file open this is now knight takes c5 wins the tempo right we attack the queen he has to attend to that queen giving us another move it's basically kind of like we're playing two moves in a row obviously we're not but his move is kind of empty because he just has to move his queen okay um so bishop d7 would have kept the queens on the board but this is a huge concession it makes his pieces very passive one option here is to centralize our queen and then attack d5 there's many ways to play this but anyways don't want to delve too deeply here takes the queen takes the bishop fakes bishop c6 literally just trading all the pieces trading rooks as well centralizing the knight taking now here just very very quickly had bukti not been possible let's ace king would have been on g7 the move king f1 i want this to make sense to everybody why is this better than h3 because h3 allows him to infiltrate with rookie 2. this is not the end of the world we can drop our knight back and attack the rook force it back but again h3 is the most careful move because it actually kills three birds with one stone it brings the king closer to the center which is something you want to do in the end game it stops rookie 2 and it also prevents the backrank checkmate hey lily good to see you so this is the kind of multi-purpose move that you want to make many times throughout the game and at the end the game was over immediately king f1 how do we win a position like this well the first thing i'd do is i'd centralize the king and it depends where or black at some point you would start playing a4 and there's two fundamental ways of winning a position like this i mean even without the knight kind of the same thing right bring the knife back you can directly promote the pawn using your resources to promote the spawn you can also use the spawn as a decoy this is what i would probably end up doing trying to distract his king and then in the time that his king spends attending to the pawn you then come around and take all of these pawns and promote your pawns so this is how this would look right you would just come around and vacuum up these pawns and um if you wanted to actually just promote the pawn without going around then you would literally stick to the queen side and you would use the other pawn to prepare a5 and etcetera etcetera i don't want to delve too deeply into this i think most people can comfortably realize an advantage like this art sastrom alright so he goes g3 well in such situations we already know the rule of thumb we simply occupy the center again this is one of those openings where we don't really need to overthink things let's just develop our pieces again and again and again we see this hammered homie goes d4 now we've already been in this situation where we need to decide between two things what are we deciding here what is black's main decision what is black's main decision whether to do what closed or open or push so what do you guys think should we close the position here we can actually do either i mean either is good but i want to give you guys some more practice closing the position up i want to show because a lot of people and i don't want to put words in anyone's mouth um but a lot of people just don't have that intuition about playing in closed positions we had one of them before in this speed run which is more like a slow run but that's why i called it a speed run just a little bit of a troll uh it is a slow run but i wanna reinforce these concept now he plays this correctly you go c4 remember guys from the last time you want to attack the base of the pawn chain so how do we react here we don't really take the pawn because that would make our center collapse we instead protect the pawn with another pawn going c6 building what's called a pawn chain he's go he goes queen c2 which is a bit of an aimless move and uh this allows us simply to continue developing which we are going to do by bringing our bishop out well he go so he's just doing all this stuff that's that's you know we don't want to dismiss it we don't want to ignore it but we just want to continue developing okay we basically do ignore it he's moving his pawns while we're developing our pieces but let's try to decide now how we will continue our development where do you guys think that we should put this bishop where does this bishop on c8 belong also bearing in mind what he just did he played h4 what is the consequence of the move h4 the consequence is that he can no longer play h3 which means we can slam this bishop onto a really weak square it's kind of like an outpost for the bishop he continues to expand now here's the thing guys and this is i know going to be hard to swallow but there comes a time when he's so undeveloped so undeveloped that we actually need to open up the center even if that means opening up and destroying our own pawn chain okay there are situations that are it's so important to open the center that it's even worth sacrificing the integrity of the pawn chain to open up that center because what you guys are going to notice and i will talk about this in depth after the game there chess is a game where you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs and here because he's on developed he's going to pay the price for it even though we don't have um a pawn chain he's made an even worse move he's given up the only piece that defends all of the weak light squares around his king so it's going to be very important to adhere to two principles thank you so much and chris one is going to be to play actively to play with tempo the other is going to be to keep our eyes on the press keep opening up the center when possible but to protect all our pawns so can we defend this bishop of tempo to answer our first question can we defend this bishop with gain of tempo we can but daniel aren't you moving upon in front of the king well i addressed this earlier right yes we are but look at white's pieces all of his pieces are on his starting square and he thinks he's a genie he went upon i don't care let him take this pawn we're going to keep opening stuff up and ripping apart the center and the queen's head how else do we open up the position any other pawn breakthroughs remember f4 is not working are there other pawn breakthroughs we could execute are there any yeah let's go a5 let's open up that queen side too the more we open up the harder it's going to be for him to uh protect his pieces and his weak pawns thank you oh look at that file that's a juicy file can we occupy that file with one of our pieces that beautiful c file let's occupy that file how can we do that and i know that i'm getting low on time but don't worry if i get down to 30 seconds i will take over yeah defending attacking the bishop now do you guys remember when he played h4 a move like h4 you need to be very attentive to because it creates a lot of weaknesses in particular you guys see this car what can we do with the g3 pawn what can we do with that g3 pawn oh absolutely absolutely let's take that pawn absolutely because what's gonna happen is that he's so undeveloped as soon as we open up the position piece is a very small price to pay and i'm i'm how do you know that well i know that intuitively i'll explain a little bit more of the thought process i'll explain a little bit more of the thought process after the game but by and large a lot of people should see this right you can see how overwhelmingly better developed we are and all that remains after he plays king f1 is to open up the position a little bit more and he's just going to collapse so what do we do after king f1 how do we continue opening up the position a certain move that used to be impossible is now possible yep bingo dr lono get ready because we are about to crush knight f3 how do we proceed okay he's just sort of collapsing he's trying to throw water onto the fire um what do we do what do we take what do we take and we can take several different things um we can take the knight or we can take the pawn both moves are fine um but what do we do first well let's let's take the knight first okay because um we attack the rook and if he's offering us that material back let's just deal with that so we don't have to worry about it and now after king g1 okay he goes king u1 so what do we do now and this speaks to the concept of flexibility right we don't want to pre-move ftxd3 he's offered us a rook we're just taking a rook and we're still attacking this game is over notice that i still haven't taken i finally take on e3 and how do we actually win the game using one of the main principles we have discussed which is that when you're up so much material what you often want to do is just bring all of the rest of the pieces into the game that's going to make it so much easier to actually deliver the checkmate rather than hunting for the mate with very few pieces rook f3 is fine but let's practice that art of bringing pieces in i know this isn't the best move i know i have 24 seconds left don't worry i'll win but i still want everybody to practice always bringing pieces in when you get obsessed with that you find that this allows you to win the game in a far easier manner after king c4 how do we win his queen i want to hear a move before i make a move i want to hear someone say the move come on guys queen e 2 bingo you say z got it and now i can actually win rook f5 if he goes d5 i take it boom boom now i'm up a queen and then i'm gonna take his bishop and the game is over red rover and those of you who are holding your breasts do not because i am experienced but don't try this at home check and where is the mate where is the mate okay i'm giving it away of course you see how easy it was after i brought my pieces and i'm sorry for the time scramble at the end this guy was good he was resilient he was not bad at all and you can see that these guys are resisting a little bit better okay now let's unpack this game so here if you did not want to close up the center you could also play the move knight c6 which would be entirely possible entirely doable um but i want to close up the center because i want to show you guys a little bit more how to play with the center being close so he goes queen cc and he starts playing all these pawn moves this is what people often do he just doesn't know what what he's doing i mean he does not know what the plan is bishop g4 and this is the key moment in the entire game you might be asking why was there such a necessity to open up the center well the thing is if we continue developing then he kind of justifies you know what he's just done how can he now proceed on the queen side and close things up and then start attacking actually and and this is why partially yep this is partially why now he can start developing maybe he wouldn't have but this is partially why it's so hard to play with closed positions because not only do you have to handle the intricacies of the closed position itself but you sometimes have to recognize the moment when to open the position up okay that's why we took because none of his pieces are developed he should have taken the c4 pawn and now we could have ripped the position open further by playing a5 a move that we played later on in the game he gets into big trouble here because he cannot keep things closed for very much longer okay how did i know that that's the right time to attack well i realized that if i gave him one more move he would have played c5 that wouldn't have been terrible but i did not want to give them give him that opportunity again okay um so that's basically the intuitive backdrop behind dtx4 now here i could have not allowed queen e6 could have gone queen d7 okay um and that would have been perfectly fine i didn't have to play with temple but i wanted to emphasize that sometimes it's very important to play with temp i also wanted to emphasize that sometimes pawns are not important and this is one of those situations okay this is one of those situations yes he's up upon look at this his queen is the only piece that's developed all of his other pieces are underdeveloped are undeveloped which means two things first of all we need to keep opening up the position second thing we have to operate with a sense of urgency what happens if we don't operate with a sense of urgency is that with every piece that he develops he minimizes our initiative he minimizes our advantage because our advantage is dynamic which means it can evaporate at any moment if he develops two or three pieces well guess what his position is still riddled with holes but it's not nearly as bad as it would be here so that is why we play a5 okay he goes b5 opens the c file and now we go queen c7 dynamic and static are opposites attacking the bishop and also eyeing that g3 pawn how did i know to eye that g3 bundle as i said the moment he played h4 i made a mental note on my mental database of observations look at this pawn always look at this pawn as soon as i play queen c7 he sacrifices now on the table this is the importance of observation i've talked about this since the very first game of the speedrun chess is not only about looking for moves you know about calculating it's also about observing making observations just like in the scientific method okay the more you observe the more you note down the more informed and the deeper your ideas eventually become and it's not rocket science to make an observation like this one okay so i noted that pawn and this is when i remembered it because it's easier now for me after so many years of experience to keep these observations uh in in my mind um i get it until contact with the pawns exactly knight d2 bishop takes g3 okay so this sacrifice should now make a lot of sense to everybody because we have such an overwhelming number of pieces already in the attack now we're trying to open up that f file now in this position and i don't think i'm doing scc i did do the junior sec what would happen if white played e4 and this is the move that would cause a lot of people concerned because it looks like he keeps the file closed but again we need to be very flexible we need to take stock of all of our attacking pieces and see which ones can now participate directly in the attack and this mover this move ends the game because it threatens essentially checkmate and if he takes well then we open up that file so this literally just walls close in around white's gang the game is over instead he won knight f3 trying to throw his body between me and the king but it doesn't matter and here i just decide to take all of his pieces now here a lot of people yeah why not rook f3 kind of ladder checkmate he has to cover with this queen moving the queen again i'm not saying this isn't the best move it probably is i'm trying to emphasize the general concept of bringing the pieces in very patiently so that then the wind becomes a little bit easier by the way at the very end this is a very simple tactic i'm seeing the king is defending the queen it's overloading you are distracting i guess also decoy you're distracting the king from the defense of the pawn it's a very very simple mechanism that most people should see intuitively but i will point out a piece of advice here which is that um the two worst defenders and listen closely because i'm gonna make a couple qualifications here the two worst defenders of a piece are the king and the queen when the king or the queen defending peace that piece is generally very very vulnerable why if they it that's counterintuitive in the queen sense because you might think the queen is the best defender but it's the worst defender because the moment a queen is attacked it has to move the moment a knight is attacked by another night sometimes you couldn't reinforce that knight but when a queen is attacked it essentially has to move and abandon whatever piece it's defending and the same exact thing goes for the king the king by law by the laws of chess has to move when it is attacked that is czech and so it comes above everything else the king is a very selfish peace so it must abandon whatever piece it's protecting you guys see what i'm saying so just keep that in your mind any questions before we move on to perhaps the final uh or the penultimate game of the speedo i appreciate everybody's support and all the subs and everybody just participating it's awesome and uh thank you for also respecting my wishes in terms of politics uh drake speaking of subs and support drake th95 with two months appreciate it thank you so much all right fantastic let's move on i guess okay 810 nishant mundus and here we're actually going to play an opening other than what we've been playing so far well he's done that for us so he's played d4 and let's play d5 let's play it classically conventionally goes a3 okay so this is already a bad move which basically means we can develop and he's giving us a lot of time now the movie six would not be actually optimal what would be the optimal scheme of development here and the way to understand that is to realize what the drawback is of the movie 6. if you guys know what the drawback is you know that you want to first develop the bishop outside the pawn chain and then play e6 and prepare the development of the other bishop okay so he's making moves with the same piece he seems like he's intimidating us let's ignore him let's just keep developing and you guys will see quickly that this okay well this is just ridiculous he has absolutely no pieces to exploit this you know slight weakening of our king expected lemon thank you for the five months how do we continue how do we continue what do we do how do we actually coordinate our forces justin thank you let's castle let's finish castling now in such situations as yazi and others are pointing out it's a very good idea to ask the bishop okay so he does our bidding force h6 is a great idea sometimes because if bishop h4 we would later be able to play g5 should we need to get rid of the pin now let's continue what's called castling by hand that would be playing rook fate now playing king g8 and that's as simple as that we just move our king and we've essentially castled without actually castling do we care about the double pawns we do not because he's helping us straight pieces what do you notice now about this position what do you guys notice um and and what observations can we make that might motivate us to decide between trying to trade pieces and trying to attack now we've got the open f file not only do we have the open file we have access to the semi-open g-file with the king can we exploit the f2 pawn if we didn't have the bishop here it would be made but it actually turns out and i'll give you guys a little bit of it and it's very hard actually to exploit that because and i've mentioned this before be very careful when you're considering a move like bishop d3 because he takes with the queen and he simultaneously vacates the d1 square for the knight bishop takes c2 he takes with the queen of defense f2 the advice specifically that i have to share is when you're considering a discovery specifically a discovery make sure that he cannot take the piece that delivers the discovery and simultaneously defend the pawn of the square that you're trying to target that is one of the most common sources of mistakes instead of this i'm gonna go queen g6 and i'm going to redirect my attack on this incredibly weak g2 square but can't he castle what he can but this walks right into a very very typical stock tactical pattern you can take this but let's keep our eyes on the prize there's a far greater prize which is of course the king we go bishop h3 we force him to go g3 we're going to win another exchange and we are going to end up simply up a full rook yes we don't no longer have an immediate attack but well never mind i guess we do have an immediate attack yeah he's not exactly in the best of form it seems in this game but again uh he also yeah well that okay well let's just end the game here with the queen takes you two yeah um in any case just i guess this will be a quick one uh every it should make sense to everybody that the movie six is sub-optimal because it blocks the bishop but those of you who know the queen's gambit know that black often plays e6 and i mean the opening not the show so you might be like well daniel just told me queen's gambit is bad i see hikaru and others playing the queen's game but is the queen's gamut then bad it's not bad the queen's gamut is one of the most reputable one of the most solid openings in existence but when you're playing black you sometimes have to play an opening that contains a drawback almost every opening has drawbacks particularly with black and you could play bishop f5 here that's called the baltic opening but the drawback of that is that he can take on d5 and essentially destroy black center okay so just wanted to make clear the king's queen's gamut is not terrible it's an incredibly good opening uh but given the opportunity we can basically play the queen's gamut on steroids if you play c4 we play e6 and our bishop is outside the pawn chain thank you zero eleven vlad 110 for the twitch prime let's keep that hype train going this is awesome um thank you guys so much okay so the rest was very straightforward now what would we have done what would we have done and jelly asks a great question why the hell not bishop g4 the move bishop g4 might have walked into knight e5 um and you're pressuring this bishop that's really the only reason this is not even bad we can now bring the bishop back to f5 but there's really no reason to uh to allow this move curious jim banzu with five gifted tier one subs to the community thank you so much incredible stuff going on tuscinator carso triple n griller kingkiller88 and raslos uh receiving the subscriptions thank you so much carrie as always so supportive okay so what would we have done had he simply and one nd7 gifting a sub to shival and this is incredible how would we play in a position like this after castling could somebody explain to me a good plan in this position yeah i'll all hundred bits corgis are cute thank you tortugas grande and what would be the plan here yeah so you guys really are aware of the ideas you would go c5 to undermine the d4 square which brings me to a detour i myself play an opening called the job of london yaziz five holy smokes dpp 67 momentum kyle's speaking of momentum kyle motto missy marvin and the hound of cs the move knight is knight c3 move knight c3 it's not the same as going e4 and knight f3 because the moon knight c3 blocks his ability to either go c3 to protect upon or c4 to contest black spawn that's why this is not a standard move i still play it for a you know other reasons that i won't get into right now but that's the reason why knight c3 is often frowned upon in queens pawn openings precisely for the reason on full display here the d4 pawn is now under significantly more pressure than it would have been if light would have been able to play c3 after he castles we can go knight pd7 and try to get this knight out of e5 that's why it's only strong piece if we can get this knight out of v5 we have fantastic coordination between our pieces we have the ability to attack on the king side and the ability to pressure the queen side perhaps by bringing the rook to c8 okay that was a lot um i hope that that makes sense to everybody any last questions after he took i really don't have to get into this we just castled by hand and played queen g6 just to show the move bishop takes c2 very very common blunder to repeat that piece of advice when you are looking for a discovered attack or a discover check or discovered whatever make sure that you are not let's say sacrificing a piece and allowing your opponent to recapture it and simultaneously defend whatever square or pawn or piece you are trying to discover the attack on okay i hope that that makes sense a little bit of clunky wording i'll work on it but i think that the gist of it makes it what about yeah bishop h3 would be possible uh and perhaps he could castle here and then we could play queen g6 so we could do the same transposed that would be acceptable bishop e4 would be acceptable would bishop d3 be acceptable according to the application of our device would this move be acceptable because he can't take this way this way but what could white do here it would not why not why wouldn't this be acceptable queen takes d3 and unfortunately he's opened up this d1 and black is still attacking black is still much better there's really no no point here now bishop b4 he would castle after queen g6 he could play f3 we don't have the same thing we did in the game unfortunately the bishop has to move we could take c2 we're up a pawn but we're not up in exchange right with queen g6 and bishop h3 we win an entire exchange and we're up an entire rook given that we were up a piece already okay let's proceed if everybody's ready on to the next game
