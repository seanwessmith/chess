so let's go e4 okay so this guy plays the french which we haven't really faced much uh there's a couple of good options against the french that i recommend to intermediate players one of them is called the reside variation where i just talk about the lines that we can play and our opponent resigns that's a fantastic line [Music] i was gonna say knight c3 here is a good line uh this is like the topical variation of the french there is also e5 which is called the advance by the way the french if anybody's curious why is the french called the french the first person to have ever played the french let me see the first person to have ever played the french was well it was cochrane it was that same guy who developed the cochrane gambit okay so the city of paris played the french in 1834 in a game against the city of london and that was very common in the 19th century the two cities for to play a game and they would submit the moves by telegram uh but but the city of paris is not the first to play the french okay 1751 very strong player let's hope he doesn't abort okay let's go e4 e5 we've been playing the sicilian a lot recently but let's let's go back to e5 for a second okay so let's see if okay he plays in italian so my favorite move here is bishop to c5 knight f6 and either okay so d4 is one of the main moves this is the the old main line bishop before check this is all very normal knight takes c4 and now d5 okay so this this line i'm playing this fast because this is all theoretical line i actually don't remember it so i could i could get in trouble here quite quickly let me see if i can remember what we're supposed to do here i think we're supposed to drop the bishop back to f6 he goes rookie one and then we cancel i think uh there is a way here for black to get an advantage this is called the miller counter gambit okay but this is not the right move i'm pretty sure because now i think we can just take back on c6 and can somebody explain to me perhaps why is it that after b takes c6 rookie one we don't lose our knight what move are we gonna have after that yeah we're gonna have d5 and we're going to simultaneously attack the bishop and defend the knight so i think this move dc is already a mistake i think he had to play rookie one and that leads to a theoretical line so now we're up two pawn we're up two pawns and it just doesn't seem like he's got much to show for them uh because we're gonna play d5 okay d5 baby is right and i think he's recognized it i did not lose the knight remember that i took his knight and he didn't recapture back and he took my knight but only after he accepted the loss of his now in this position i think almost everybody would be inclined to play bishop f5 but we don't have to do that and again this is something that i want to make very clear we are up two pawns and we have a set of priorities and our top priority is to remove our king from the line of fire of the rook if that means we sacrifice one of our extra pawns to do that so be it he doesn't even take it okay now we can safely play bishop f5 to buttress the knight that's totally fine then we could deploy our queen to d7 in the event of we could have also oh we could have just taken the pawn but there's no need for that kind of greediness so and someone's getting a big raid after this game okay queens of c2 so how do we go about doing this we can well he's attacking the pawn we can protect it in several ways the move i like is c5 let's just push the spawn forward the knight defends the pawn and if he takes on e4 with a bishop well then we can just recapture with our bishop and we potentially threaten to  his pawn structure with bishop takes b2 hopefully this is making sense so far he goes 95 what should we do here what moves come to mind does anybody want to suggest perhaps a way let's say to dislodge this knight from e5 how do we get it out of there while deploying another one of our pieces moves like rookier are the glue moves they're the moves that make our position tick he counter attacks our knight but trades are good for us thank you silent menace 13 for the prime trades are good for us because we're the ones up two puns we're up three puns and now we're going to be up more than three pounds we're going to be up a piece after we make what move what move now wins a very simple fork queen to d4 remember he's weakened the diagonal in front of his king by as soon as f3 is played you must pay attention sorry to this diagonal because that diagonal is the key to the kingdom in many cases now we take another piece queen e7 is right and the game is over we're up a piece we're up three pawns and we have total domination let's get the rook involved through d8 never forget to involve your pieces when you're up material we have many ways to win this uh let's go g6 to create some luft for our king some air let's go f5 to defend our bishop and now we're going to go queen to d to force the queen trade or uh take a bunch of his pawns or deliver checkmate depends on what he decides to do um yeah we're just going to trade queens that's the easiest and how do we win this position i've talked about this many times what you want to do is identify where you can create a past pawn and then create it he's basically creating it for us uh we can also what i was preparing is the move c3 getting rid of one of our doubled pawns that the other one is going to be passed and uh this is just going to be a winning position for black okay let's go c3 well we got 4481 viewers that's ridiculous and now well we can push our pawn but what's the simplest move here instead of pushing our pawn what can we do just to eliminate any possibility of counter play by white we can what that really means is we need to look for ways to trade rooks we can do that by playing rook to c2 that's the simplest we're just gonna have an extra bishop and two past pawns that cannot be stopped so the game is over we can resign that's also that's always possible yeah nice nice nice okay this is over and uh that was simple because our opponent messed up the opening but oh my lands damn girl jab jam with 25 gifted subs oh my lance this is ridiculous ridiculous that is a huge number right there we are almost at 36 30 700. this is unbelievable thank you jam jam for another 25 gifted subs crazy absolutely crazy stuff and uh this is ridiculous enjoy guys thank you telemamma for the prime it's like i'm obligated to keep playing well i don't know what to say and he finally resigns um yeah i mean this is uh this is unbelievable thank you jack star and we got more subs we got jackster a one aotn with a prime okay okay i'll i'll consider it just give me a sec holy smokes okay now i gotta play one because we got yazizy gifting 10 subs this is the most generosity i've ever seen and it's been going on like this for days and days and days he's back he's back with 10 gifted oh my lance this is remarkable ladies and gentlemen happy thanksgiving indeed uh thank you yazizy for the 10 gifted there is always a gifting battle going on 36.80 and wanje with the prime jam jam gifting to ignore 27. i can't keep up with this we are 18 away from 2700 3700 this is ridiculous okay um let's see yeah you guys are awesome is understating it tremendously um how do you feel after all this no i'm fine zam 13 ho 10 more it doesn't even end oh my god zan13 with 10 subs oh my god oh i can this is not happening right now this is not happening right this is not happening right i need to keep my voice down because this is this is illegal montana chess with a hundred hundred gifted subs and then proffer with twenty this is actually the most progress thing ever we got four thousand people watching insaneness happened insanity montana chess has previously supported me tremendously with doughnuts yeah zazie we got we got a sub from urca 33 zaizzy with 10 again oh my god i'm not even analyzing holy smokes oh chuck cheese curl of five four thousand here we come when i hit 3 000 i thought that was ridiculous what is this what is this montana chess just gifted a hundred subs followed by 20 followed by 5g mario 2 pandora with a prime shush about our money laundering magnolia with the gift it's up to wowzer78 over 3700 i can't concentrate this is ridiculous e-dog 3650 gifting three subs to the community oh my god i'm just sitting back and watching this happen as gem jam gifting 10 months oh my god are you serious ladies and gentlemen it just keeps on going i guess the speed run was a good decision 38-44 well-spoken oc lot with a sub yeah we've got and rob easy-e with the prime wow keep threatening to leave min with a thousand bits he says you think it's over girl yeah this is amazing blind win nine wow these are indeedy car numbers uh these are incredible numbers um 38.47 yeah keep going unbelievable excuse me well thanks i've never seen something like this i mean it's like one night after another um oh definitely okay uh all right let's go let's keep playing we gotta keep playing so this game really quickly just uh this line that he played this is called the miller counter gambit and the idea is that he sacrifices a piece but he tries to oh the board is frozen sorry yeah the board is frozen my bad my bad there we go and we got bc crispy with five gifted holy smokes it doesn't even end there and the key mistake that he made was that he basically took the wrong knight he should have gone he should have gone after the e4 knight with rook to e1 500 bits from snap boy and a hundred bits from choir pm and uh he should have taken this knight so that it would be harder for us to develop our bishop but by taking dc he's allowed us to go d5 now we're two pawns up our knight is defended and uh and our bishop has excellent prospects so he played a little bit too fast and after this the key move is just a castle right we tuck our king away we don't let him exploit it and now we go c5 chasing the knight away very simple moves and then we win everything with queen d4 check yeah 100 4 000 subs i can't even believe we're uttering those words we're playing a guy who is 1641 acos she's robles let's go e5 again and let's go with a classical okay um let me disable the alerts for a second oh five thousand bits oh my lands what is this another bomb i can't even keep up with this five thousand bits from jam let's go knight f6 this is the main line of the rye lopez it should be familiar to most people um these are just the main moves we're developing our pieces the normal squares and at this point he's threatening to capture our knight and capture on e5 so the time has come for us to remove the bishop from its post on a4 now we need to open up our own bishop and so we play the move d6 to support the center and open up the bishop this is still well within the range of the main line of the rye lopez thank you the giovanni 95 for the tier one i appreciate it now we castle and the main move here is h3 so he plays d3 which which is a move it's not the most active mode but it is a move and um and and and there's many ways for black here to develop my pieces right we can develop this bishop to g4 we can well bishop g4 isn't as good as it seems i'm gonna play this move even though it's not as good as it seems and after the game i'm going to explain why bishop g4 maybe he'll show us now i'm gonna go knight to well no actually let's go what should we do here should we do let's get this bishop out of this annoying little square on b3 we're gonna go knight a5 we're going to expand on the queen side with c5 it's very typical idea now if he knows what he's doing we're going to bring our knight back into the game he'll get his knight to g3 and that's exactly why the pin isn't as effective here he played this perfectly he's forcing our bishop back and we could have put a bishop there in the first place so we wasted a couple of time you know he's playing this incredibly well d4 is good now we're going to take and the other problem that we're encountering here is that he's threatening a fork with d5 so we're gonna have to take on d4 but now what we're left with is a not sure i like this time consumption but what we're left with is a weak pawn on d6 a giovanni 95 with five gifted subs so what do we need to do in this position what we need to do in this position is activate the bishop on e7 it's currently kind of passive and so we'll need to put it on f6 but to do that we need to move the knight away from d7 thank you the giovanni 95 it just keeps going and going uh this is incredible stuff here okay so he goes knight d5 let's get rid of that knight that was an annoying night let's get rid of it and now we can put our bishop on a very nice square on a very nice diagonal yeah gem jam is indeed the greatest ever g6 okay blunting his influence over the diagonal obviously he was threatening checkmate oh thank sorry ac7iomin now this knight on d7 where can we put it where should it where does it belong where does this knife belong it belongs either on c5 or it belongs on e5 either of those two squares are fine and when you have a situation like this where you have two possible moves you're not sure which one to make it often makes sense to make a third move something a little bit more flexible so that we can only develop our knight when we're absolutely sure of where we want to put it that's why i'm going to play the move rook to c8 deploying our rook to an open file because maybe i want to put the knight on e5 maybe i want to put it on c5 i don't know uh it depends on what he's going to do so that's why we're going to hold off on that decision for a second okay by the way queen a5 also something to point out here which would fork his his rook and his pawn on a2 that's another possibility in the future uh yeah we wanted you want to be flexible and trust you don't want to put all of your cards on the table in one go yeah 95 knight c4 is the idea okay so now it's definitely time for a little for guruski attacking the rook attacking the pawn using our queen and uh this is uh this is just starting to collapse for him now look at how our pieces are positioned i still haven't moved my knife from d7 because i haven't needed to you know there's there's been no need to do that uh instead and i just got my queen trapped i just got i could have gotten my queen trap but that was not so simple because of 95 that would that would have been pretty close okay what do we do how do we play we'll talk about that after the game he failed to spot a very big chance here what should now what i'm seeing whoa oh my goodness what this is this is unbelievable unbelievable 41 from polar bear bc as i play 95 this was the moment for it and we've got him tied up but look at this man go are we at 3 900 we are this is actually legendary and i don't know what to say this is legendary tonight might be the night this is incredible we're going to go rook to c3 getting his queen dislodging it from its attack over the rook look at how all of our pieces are operating at their full capacity doubling now on the c file we're going to go after this pawn on d5 what's our sub count now 3900 board has been frozen my bad guys sorry sorry sorry sorry i know and that's a glitch that i need to fix uh that's an obs glitch my apologies for that so we're just gonna bring our queen back now he's gone rook to c1 he's gone rook to c1 what should we do here how do we exploit the drawback of that previous move very simple solution we don't need to trade see this is where people go wrong they're like okay i need to trade rooks you don't need to do anything this rook is perfectly well protected so we can just take the pawn this might be a record of some sort we're at 39 i mean i don't know what to say now we can take the rook of course if he takes our queen then we take his we don't want to allow the queen to come to c8 so let's go queen c4 a trade is in our favor because we're up two pounds that end game is going to be completely winning uh that end game is going to be completely winning and so he resigns that's a good resignation uh and that was a pretty simple game with one exception i think i made a key blunder that could have been exploited by him let's go straight to that moment now as i've explained previously as i've explained previously how should you judge a pin the way that you should judge a pin is if a the pinned piece right the knight on f3 is defended by a pawn then by definition the pin is going to be less scary if this knight was not defended by a pawn the pen would be more scary so you shouldn't rush to always assume the best square for a piece is somewhere where it pins an opposing piece so i would have considered putting this bishop on e6 to blunt the influence of the bishop on v3 and uh what ended up happening is that he attacked our bishop and if you if we had dropped it to h5 we would have potentially allowed the knight to get into this very very nasty square on f5 and that would have been followed for example with bishop to g5 so it's okay we got our bishop back to e6 but now he's struck with d4 so what were we talking about here before i got rudely interrupted well i cried for four thousand i'm not a big crier um that's just one thing i'm just not big on so we activated the knight then the bishop the one moment i wanted to focus on in this game i very sloppily grabbed the pawn on a2 and ladies and gentlemen the move bishop b3 would have well actually oh there's a way out this oh this is cool this would have trapped the queen the queen has nowhere to go if i take the rook that's defended but black has a way to counter-attack white's queen and i think black is still in good shape here can somebody spot yeah we are 75 away i mean this is unbelievable uh the lack of support in this just what should we do here so there's a couple of ways to go about attacking white's queen rook to c3 is one and knight to e5 is the other i've talked about the situation several times the situation where both queens are hanging what should you be looking for when both queens are hanging what you should be looking for are desperado sacrifices first of all this knight on e5 do you see that white's making contact with that so why can't capture it okay and we're back in the same situation and now we're a piece down so this is no good rook to c3 may seem to run into the same exact problem right queen queen takes c3 but if you calculate a little bit further we can actually take the queen and then take the rook on e1 so if we just specifically calculate the line uh this works you can also take the rook on b1 by the way so either option works and so rook c3 was the saving grace uh that would have allowed me to save the queen i didn't actually see bishop b3 though well i did see it but i didn't notice that it that it traps the queen so um so so this was a lucky escape isn't that bishop trapped in the variation what if queen c2 or queen c2 just drops the bishop to the queen drops the queen to the bishop how does my bishop escape a couple of people are asking isn't the bishop traptor well how does when actually trap the bishop it's not easy to trap the bishop um if 95 rookie five yeah is that fightable so if you go here uh this is fightable you have two rooks for a queen and a piece which is a pretty significant material advantage for the queen and the piece but uh you could fight this i mean you could try to double rooks on the c file you could try to double rooks on the c file and you could try to to infiltrate that way uh and and and by by definitely i would not suggest anyone resign here i would i would play this myself uh bishop h6 does not want an exchange there so if you go here and then you go bishop h6 i saw this you attack the rook and attack the bishop but you can move the rook to e8 and simultaneously defend the bishop on e1 and and then the bishop could could saunter over to g7 and evacuate itself and remember that black is also up upon okay one second please yeah i can't believe this viewership is ridiculous huh okay um let's play one more i'm feeling lucky today i wonder why does anybody have any questions and by the way the way that the game ended was pretty uneventful i mean he he he managed to sort of stabilize but because of the tremendous disparity in peace activity and the fact that we're up upon why its position simply collapses okay um let's go let us go okay let's go e4 so we've been playing e4 you know and he plays the scandinavian okay so scandinavian by our opponent which is not an opening that i recommend to intermediate players now that doesn't mean it's a bad opening it's and after the game i'll talk a little bit about why it's actually not a bad opening but um let me just make a note of this so of course the the main drawback of the scandi just visually speaking is that black has only developed his queen and we are not only developing our pieces but we are also occupying the center so it seems clear that white should be better here but wow so he's also wasting time moving the same piece two squares what should we do here with white what should we do here with white how do we get rid of this pin the spin is kind of annoying i mentioned that it's not too dangerous but uh if we wanted to develop with an eye toward defending against the pen we would just go bishop e2 a lot of people don't like making this move a lot of people look at this move and say yeah the bishop is passive but it's okay not every one of your pieces needs to be conquering uh you know the fringes of the roman empire it's okay to have a single piece on e2 and it's okay to just castle and play chill now we have a chance now to capitalize on the fact that this knight is no longer pinned where can we put this knight where can we put this knight in order to exert some pressure on black's position absolutely let's centralize it i love centralizing my knights uh that sounds weird but okay i like centralizing my knights and uh we're slightly better here our opponent is playing this quite well now we need to think about where we want to put this bishop we can put it on d2 to pressure that queen through the lens of the knight i like the move bishop f4 i think it also nicely supports the knight on e5 and also if you think of it this way look at the bishop sort of skewering that pawn on c7 i would say x-raying it so something like knight c4 could come to mind but before we do anything i want to expand a little bit on the queen side let's let's grab a little bit of space on the queen side and open up the possibility for some queen b5 ideas now this queen on b6 is in a little bit of trouble what should we do how should we play why did we play a4 we created a stronghold on the b5 square knight c4 would come close to trapping the queen but queen c6 would be possible what can we put on b5 we could also go a5 but then we'd have to reckon with queen takes b2 uh and i don't actually see a way to trap the queen there so let's go knight to b5 that's the reason why we played a4 we established a nice little stronghold and now the knight is pressuring the c7 pawn how are we going to exploit and now we have an incredibly strong move which is very important to find we want to put the knight on c7 but we can't do that because he would take so we have to move this knight away with tempo no no if we play a5 we give up the knight right pawn on a4 is fulfilling a crucial role of defending the knight so what we need to do is move this knight away with tempo so that the bishop combines with the knight guards c7 and the move that does that is knight to c4 very strong move this move basically wins the game if he plays queen a6 we trap his queen and deliver the fork so he's gotta go queen d8 and he's gotta basically move his knight away and say okay i'm down in exchange the game goes on if the game is not over when we win an exchange but well he doesn't have any compensation for it things are going to be very rough for him so we'll see how he manages to defend this he can also okay knight to d5 that's a very strong move he actually found a move that i missed and the purpose of this move is that if we take on a8 then he takes on f4 and our knight on a8 could get trapped very strong move very strong we actually have to back pedal here we can play the queen e5 that's an interesting move yeah let's go queenie then he maybe goes f6 or bishop f6 if we move our bishop away then he takes the knight so we're gonna have to backpedal and take on d5 and sort of reorient ourselves let's centralize the other night this happens i mean people are good telling you guys people are good at this level i actually missed that move now this doesn't normally happen but you know these people are underrated let's support our center with the move c3 i'm going to play a little bit faster here because i'm a little bit low on time um and let's see what he does yeah men can confirm rooks either this guy is good we're just going to deploy our pieces i'm not doing anything extraordinary i'm just putting my pieces on better squares another thing i might consider here is to play h3 uh just to create a little bit of luft for our king thank you james r for the sub three months appreciate it okay let's now deploy our queen to g4 threatening checkmate if he takes on e5 what piece should we take with here should we take with the pawn or should we take with the rook yeah this opponent is playing very well rook absolutely the rook because we need to keep open possibility we're rook lift we need to keep the pressure going he's playing well we we need to drop our queen back to defend the pawn on b2 now one idea that we could have in this kind of position is to push this h-bond forward and try to provoke weaknesses in his position okay f6 we're going to drop the rope but now this pawn is weak where should we put the stroke we should put it on e1 to attack the pawn let's not forget also about the plan of going h5 h6 and provoking weaknesses in his position okay um we should also yeah let's go let's let's we can sack the spawn right because then we're going to put a queen on h on hx now we're going to move the rook to f3 skewering his king potentially preparing the move queen e5 he creates a very serious weakness where is this queen going it's going to g7 he's preventing that threat we're going to defend b2 first we're going to keep this queen nicely centralized he's probably going to go queen c7 if he plays like a gm which he probably does uh we're slowly starting to chip away at his position but yeah this guy is not 1500 okay um we also could consider doubling or tripling rather on the e-file thank you lexic for the twitch prime but he's good he's good but that was that a mistake if we take away let me calculate take stakes going to five rook f6 queen h7 yes we have a beautiful sacrifice here let's go we can crash through with rook takes f5 check if i calculated correctly queen takes f5 and it's checkmate because after oh or is it yes it is where should we go now where should we go now this is the key move it looks like he's covered against all of the checks but boom goes the dynamite queen takes h7 and we go to e7 with checkmate and that is game over red rover so we got him in the end this guy's just good let's let's give credit where credit is due this guy is just good and uh we we managed to outplay him okay so i want to unpack that key moment after he played knight d5 i know some people are a little bit confused at what happened there why did i not take his rook so let's talk about that briefly okay so first of all a little bit of chess history the scandi was played the first time that's pretty funny actually let's talk some chess history the scandinavian was first played in the year 1475. i forgotten that now i remember here's a piece of chess trivia i've shared before as hojo jordan brings us one step closer to that magic number thank you for the prime now chess is a very old game it's existed for several thousand years but chess has not always existed with modern rules and when chess came to europe around the 13th 1400s the first ever game of chess recorded in modern history played with modern rules was played between i believe two spanish monks in the year 1475. and that game featured the scandinavian mr vinolus who played the first ever game of chess recorded with modern rules thank you admiral jones gifting to uh fwip for the sox was played with the scandy so was played in 1475 and then after that in 1837 so there was about a 400 year gap between the first time the scandinavian was played and then the second time it was played uh which is kind of cool in any case i just want us i want to fast forward really quickly to the moment when he played this move knight c5 and there's i want to explain this and then i want to share one very important piece of it uh why is the scandinavian not good for beginners and openings like the scandi are not bad per se but in order to be able to play them well you need to learn how to break the rules right because you're moving the queen around in the opening thank you hojo jordan i really appreciate it you're moving your queen around and you need to okay i made the analogy before to driving so let's say you're learning how to drive and your instructor says and he puts you in a bus before you've ever learned how to drive a car okay does that sound like a good way of learning uh that has all these added complexities i actually quite admire people who drive buses i can't imagine how that's possible but first you need to get the basics down before you add these twists and so openings like the scandi or openings like the perk you know they require you to to have possession of all of these additional controls and in my opinion that can actually sometimes curtail the proper learning process so that's why i usually advise against these types of openings now the other thing to point out is in this key position we did not take on a8 why not because knight takes f4 would have followed and if you guys will notice this knight on a8 has no passage back if you try to go queen e5 to evacuate the knight via c7 actually black has quite a beautiful move here a nice little tactic that starts with queen takes d4 and then picking the queen off and this knight just seems to be dead meat after knight a6 uh because that rook is just gonna go around and capture it and the thing is if you go to c7 it the knight doesn't have any prospects from there either now you guys might look at this and say hold on hold on how did you see this how did you know well it's pattern recognition because i've seen other openings such as an opening called the baltic the baltic is a response to the queen's gambit bishop f5 and in the baltic this occurs very frequently if white falls into a certain trap he goes e3 allows knight b4 can somebody tell me what black should do in this position somebody tell me what black should do in this position well yes i'm down the exchange there but you're gonna lose another piece one second guys nope queen take spawn boom boom and you win a second game sorry you win a second pawn by the way e3 would be also interesting trying to pave the way for the knights of c2 but then the knight drops back to d3 i would say e4 e5 is the best way to start uh because then again you learn how to follow the rules although i guess here queen takes d4 so that would also be good but i wanted to show the the sort of the the influence of planner and recognition on your thinking and i used to fill up entire notebooks with you know this kind of stuff you know noting down these interesting patterns but what did we do in this game we said okay okay you got me i'm just gonna take on d5 and white still has a perfectly fine position so what i was going to tell everybody is if you meet with a move that you haven't seen or you didn't see something you don't want to lose your your cool right you want to make the most out of the situation and if that means back pedaling and admitting your mistake and getting a normal position then then that's what that that means but you don't want to stubbornly go for a strategy or a line that you know is bad uh you want to give yourself the maximum amount of chances and what did we do here we provoked a bunch of weaknesses on his king side and eventually that led up to a sacrifice and checkmate rook takes f5 is a move that you just have to look at right uh and you have to look at this move because you ask yourself what is the drawback of his previous move whenever your opponent plays a move near his king with a pawn uh then you need to immediately understand okay what what impact did that make on his position and it's clear to anyone here that the pawn on f5 is now not as well defended and so you got to be optimistic right if you calculate rook f5 you see that his king is out of squares by the way magnus carlsen i swear i saw magnus carlsen game where he um where he had a very similar combination he had a very similar combination if you guys will give me a moment this is a program called chess bass it's a program that sort of all the gm's use it was developed originally in the late 80s uh it's pretty costly but if you're over 2000 i would say that uh it it it is a very it's an indispensable tool for any gm uh one thing that allows you to do is it allows you to find any game that you want it allows you to search any position to see all of the games that have been played from that position but i remember this game so this was a karo khan and let me go to the important moment magnus actually played a brilliant game he sacrificed two pieces in order to attack now he sacrifices a rook and he basically well i'm going to show you guys the checkmate he lifts the rook up and in this position he goes queen f5 check rook f6 and now can somebody tell me the final move of the game what is the final move the game it's not queen h7 queen h7 lets the king escape via e6 it's queen to d7 and this is checkmate you guys see the similarity king on f7 sandwiched between the rooks if we look at our game well i would say it's pretty similar uh so i was thinking about that game as i was delivering this mate i think there's there's something distinctly distinctly similar uh about this and so yeah that's sort of how pattern recognition works you see enough of these games they're beat into your head and you sort of you know that that circles around in your mind
