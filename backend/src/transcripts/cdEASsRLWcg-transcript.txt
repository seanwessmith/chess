[Music] all right 1572 we're playing some serious opponents guess what opening i'm gonna play the king's indian we had some requests i'm gonna play the king's indian which is an opening where you fee encounter your bishop as early as possible now in the well in the king's indian as i've explained previously it's what's called a hyper modern opening and in the hyper modern openings you give up a large share of the center and in return you try to attack the center from a distance with some of your pieces in particular the bishop the knight comes out and you only claim control of the center when you're ready to do so this is the concept that people don't always understand because it's not intuitive to not control the center your your conditions so early in your chest career to control the center it looks like white is winning here i mean look at this oh we've got nothing the reality is black is already better he's overextended himself this is the essence of hyper-modern openings when we strike in the center we mean business the reason we mean business is because the reality is my pieces are positioned a lot better than my opponents his bishop and his knight aren't really coordinated and he's basically going full steam ahead engaging me in the center but he's not ready for that he's overextended so watch what i do take d4 now the first thing a lot of people will see is wait a second he takes the knight and he wins a piece because if i take the knight he takes the bishop what did he miss what do we do 1500 is fine that's when i started playing the king's indian i wouldn't say it's good for total beginners though i would recommend starting with a queen's gamut very nice ef6 and we are in good shape uh and let's see now what's going on here we are attacking two two pieces simultaneously in addition we have opened an avenue to his king that is a very dangerous avenue okay and uh he is in huge trouble we are also going to be up upon because we have taken two pawns and he's taken zero so we're going to be up a piece we're going to be attacking him uh sorry we're going to be up a pond we're going to be attacking him and he's underdeveloped we are crushing him in eight moves this is why the king's indian is a great opening he's making it look good and we actually get to keep the king's indian bishop so we can take with either piece uh the reason i don't really want to take with the queen is maybe because he has knight t5 attacking the queen so let's take with the bishop again keeping the queen for the more important tasks i have two headphones what do we do here uh how do we continue and i've already mentioned the move we just have to put things in the right order oh look at this little juicy morsel right here we're going to attack the hell out of that one exactly he has to play bishop d3 to defend and then how are we going to follow up the attack on the knight on e4 what are we going to do to keep the attack on that going okay all right uh sorry guys he gives up that entirely okay now how do we convert such a position in the easiest manner a lot of people want to take the pawn i'm sure no no no no no there's a higher priority the priority is to stop him from castling if we can stop him from castling we are going to massacre him down the e-file how do we stop him from castling now we can give a queen check that's a great move but let's do that in a slightly subtler way let's play queen e7 this is the way that i like stopping him from castling because it also builds the pressure on the e5 we kill two birds with one stone do you guys see how often i try to do that when i have an intention that i'm trying to fulfill with the move i'm trying to fulfill other intentions along the way with that same move so if i'm trying to stop him from castling i'm trying to find a move that also is somehow conducive to my to my uh other goals okay bishop f5 is possible but we can attack the queen war directly we can also play rookie iii uh the queen must move and after the queen moves guess what that pressure down the e file is finally going to bear fruit because we will be able to play what move do not forget about pawns as attackers people always forget about pawns that and the fact that they can be full-fledged participants in an attack bingo goodbye bishop he can't castle he can't well you can castle but now it's too late he loses the bishop miguel now he castles and the game is over he loses two pieces uh but remember what i kind of started the speedrun with what do you never forget to do when you're up a lot of pieces what do you have to remember and remind yourself to do and this is the reason a lot of people lose winning positions yep very good develop we we haven't developed our queen side yet so let's do that the win is going to be a lot easier if we have all of our pieces involved and i like that people are whoa thank you for that okay now we can even avoid developing but i will not i will complete the development and uh the game is over now this is what the king's indian can get can give you i mean a lot of extra pieces we take another rook and now we take a knight okay we're up a couple of pieces here and now it's checkmate that was a pretty smooth king's indian game man this reminds me of why i play it i wonder what our accuracy was our accuracy was probably perfect in this game because all of our moves were relatively straightforward um no but again let's not forget that these people are you know they don't necessarily sign up to play me so uh you know we have a good time but at the end of the day i respect i respect all these people greatly for for playing me and you know being good sports about it which they are and their ratings are refunded so again i'm laughing but it's all in good fun i'm not trying to to make fun of anybody uh you know these guys are capable of playing very very well and giving me a run for for my money okay um so quickly let's go over this game because it wasn't that complicated now a little bit of chess history when when was the first time the king's indian was ever played the first time that the king's indian was ever played according to my research according to my records is 1850 it was played by an early indian master named but banerjee and banerjee basically okay so this is super interesting guys because this tells you a lot about chess history and the way that people thought 150 years ago so watch listen to this so the indian master mohi sunder banerjee uh played a match against one of the strongest british players of the 1850s his name was john cochran john cochran was the most classic 19th century player you could possibly think of he did everything by the book and he actually developed the cochrane gambit which is this move in the petra by the way this is a very interesting line i highly recommend it to uh players in the 16 1700 range it's actually not bad uh and it can be used to get a very interesting position in the petrov so let's put on our 1800 hats let's imagine that we um that we are uh i don't know let's imagine that we're john cochran i wish i had a book from the 1800s to show you guys but i don't uh and okay we just purchased my oldest book is this one and we just purchased this book yeah so we're going to the board however they talk their hand our opponent in this game plays the king's indian what is this opening he's giving up all of the center what does cochrane play in all of the games in this match knowing what you guys know about how people thought back then what do you think he did what would what would somebody in the 1800s do here knowing the chess principles that he knew back then excellent man you guys are sharp this is like the well e5 no but he would calculate these people knew how to calculate he played the four pawns attack of course because they were taught to control the center and i'm pretty sure that cochrane was probably laughing at this opening because what the hell is black doing giving up such a monster center the four pawns attack to this day is a pretty dangerous opening now shall we check something interesting so i don't click paid people into thinking this was a chess history stream this han booked a socks bills modern chess openings written in the early 1900s shall we check what they thought of the king's indian let's check what they thought of the king's indian i don't even know if it's analyzed but let's see what they thought of the king's indian 120 years ago man this book is falling apart we might need a german speaker but i do know the german piece abbreviations let's have a look now i'm going to the table of contents okay so this is italian schweizer e4 e4 i don't want e4 this is all e4 e4 this might this might just be volume 1 with e4 sadly this is i think this is just d4 defrosher this is the french no d4 wow e4 takes up this much and d4 takes up this much this is really cool because they didn't take d4 seriously thank you danny devito for this up okay so we have d4 queen's gambits king's indian probably has like a page dedicated to it this was only played a handful of times at that time okay d4 just bear with me please for a moment i'm trying to read this knight f6 knight f3 d6 bishop f4 knight bd7 okay so we're getting there one e3 one c4 rare moves yes i have it d4 f5 they analyze the dutch wow look at this you can see the mistakes being made in the book in the dutch they give the duchess an interesting opening and in the dutch they give this line which is a line and then h6 is given an exclamation mark this is a mistake this is a mistake bishop h4 and now g5 which is a mistake and now they give bishop g3 but white has a much better move in this position what is white's move and this move i believe refutes the line e4 boom e4 now by the way they saw this idea because they didn't give f4 here because e3 undermines the pawn they didn't miss this idea but they missed d4 in this position d4 is very strong and if you take then you get checkmated and black gets overextended here so basically there are mistakes so let's see martial election d4d5 i'm still seeing d4 d5 yeah d4 spring at f6 so knight f6 was such a rare move that they basically consign it into like non-existent okay footnote number two m85 okay black probably transposes schlechter played this i don't care which left we played one g6 one b6 white plays e4 come on guys you didn't analyze the king's indian step up your game i think we should write these people whoever wrote this book i know they're all dead now but this is ridiculous no they didn't analyze it the king's indian is literally not analyzed it's just the dutch and then like rare openings no it is kind of analyzed wow they analyzed some interesting stuff actually marshall pillsbury yeah basically relegated to the king's indian is relegated to a footnote because in the year that this game was played the king's indian had only been played and there's the reason why now here's the reason no no no no this book was published in 1918 over 100 years ago and at the time that this game was published the king's indian had been played only excluding banerjee excluding the indian master who played it against cochrane and that match might not have been published or might not have been known to these guys excluding that game at the time that this game was that this book was written guess how many times the king's indian had been played i'm counting right now guess how many times the king's indian had been played at the time this book was written six it was played six times before 1922. and then the last time was 1912 18 it was one time in 1879 1880 1880 1883 tarash played it in 1885. how forward thinking was that guy can you guys imagine and this is what i tell everybody who disrespects the classics and as stein it's you know capital blank attarash they all kind of sucked guess what imagine being the first freaking person to play the king's indian the first person to realize that you could give up the entire center the entire center when everybody was laughing in your face these this is why i i really respect the classics because we stand on the shoulders of giants we know all this stuff but imagine walking into a room or a playing hall and playing something and everybody's looking over your shoulder who is this idiot playing this stuff so that's why the classics are great because somebody had the guts to walk into a playing hall and be the first person to play the king's india okay and they did it without computers and we got jayru gifting a sub as well to ziffer sorry i get worked up about this because i'm really into history but that's why this is so interesting and imagine the effort that it took to write a 780 page book in 1918 on chess openings i mean the guy who wrote this is a frickin rock star imagine how grateful people were to buy this stuff and imagine how much of an edge it would give people to read it and then there's the eight queen problem there's a lot of stuff here there's not just openings i mean i wish i could speak german there's like some chess studies and stuff um there's there's just a lot this is just like jam-packed with cool stuff games ooh somebody made it somebody made a note with a pen wow somebody made a note here with a pen this could have been written a hundred years ago somebody somebody pointed out a different move in the margins with a pen oh and this book belonged to frank roy's md so this book is inscribed to a medical doctor who is a famous surgeon died i think 15 years ago from portland and i got this from the mechanics institute in san francisco uh from my mentor john donaldson 1873. so this was written originally in 1873 this is the second edition published in 1916. but this was originally written 150 years ago wow this is so cool there's like notes here in pencil and these notes are in german wow so this this these were notes by whoever owned this before this guy uh what did the notes say no nothing it's just like moves it's just like moves uh but well anyways i i have more of this stuff i'll just need to find it but basically that's that's that sorry to go in the rabbit hole but this is really cool i think let me file this away this is the oldest thing i have thank you uh slant and shunt how much does that book cost i don't think it says but it's a beautiful it's a beautiful book it's falling apart but look at the effort that was put into the cover handbook of openings and then there's uh there's table of contents and then there's a symbols oh and look at these people they actually have uh question marks and castle long so even in the 1870s they were using algebraic notation uh so you know people haven't really changed you can see someone just reading this casually 100 years ago okay um the second oldest thing i have is before the time of beth harmon and i've already showed this this is a bound copy of the 1946 chess review this is chess review was the monthly magazine of the us chess federation and i have the 1946 bound copy there's some really cool photos in here this for example is arturo pomar a spanish kid who would later go on to become a grandmaster i always look like looking at the prices and stuff as i mentioned and some of the articles an invitation to chess by irving chernov and kenneth harkness it cost it cost two dollars two dollars to buy a hard copy book sportsman for tone tempo there's grooming essentials dr alexander alakine wow this is so interesting soviet union there's chess news four famous books cost 250 that's awesome yeah i know that's like in in that money it's it's a lot more but it's just funny pawn snatch refuted chess marches on alakine on the cover died this is the this is the the magazine those came out after alekhine died in 1946. he was on the cover of the next chess review article don't forget to get a good night of rest oh never never a grandmaster house if you can't sleep try this interesting let your jaws relax wow so alakine had died on march 24th a radio news flash announced the death of world champion alexander alekhine at the age of 53 in lisbon first reports described his death to a heart ailment but a subsequent autopsy disclosed that death had been caused by asphyxia due to an obstruction in his breathing channels due to a piece of meat yeah so that's the that's the prevailing theory about his death is that he was already in bad health this was amplified by an associated press dispatch yeah there there's a photo of him when alakine was found dead on sunday in the hotel esteril he held a piece of beef steak in his right hand intimates said friends said alekhine was accustomed to eating with his hands never using knives or forks when he could avoid them and that he would eat alone when he wanted complete enjoyment from a meal at the time of his death alekhine was working on his memoirs and playing training games with a francisco weapon now this doesn't tell the whole story because edward winter one of the leading chess historians believes that uh alekhine well alekan was already in bad health he was basically broke a very tragic story but he was basically broke uh and he was in he was in poor health so basically the the actual story is is more complicated uh but anyways this is just interesting okay uh so let's do one more round of the speed run and then i have commentary indeed with robert at 9 00 a.m tomorrow so i do want to get a good night of sleep okay uh let's do one more round of the speed and we have over a thousand people so a big shout out to everybody watching and a huge thank you to everybody who was a participant in the earlier epic stream uh i still haven't fully recovered from that um okay but um back then like you didn't he was living in the hotel like he was i think back then like the meaning of a hotel was kind of different 50 years ago in hastings i have like more stuff chess ratings oh postal chest ratings i think only correspondence chess ratings existed back then um over-the-board chess ratings did not okay let's continue let's continue are you guys ready now that we have all this chess history in front of us let's honor the greats with one more solid round of the speed run as we got kolarn with a tier one sub keeps it going on the path to 4 000 i can't believe i'm saying this but we are over 3 000 subs i'm using my earliest chess notebook to collect people's questions we've got present past and future with us right now hopefully the future generation of chess players in the chat let's continue danny k okay we have been playing the accelerated dragon which i think people are getting behind oh j root 1500 bits thanks man with a monster bomb right there thanks man okay uh so as people already know this move bishop c4 is not effective against the sicilian for what reason what is the move and if you know the move then by definition you know kind of the reason that this move is good you can play e6 but the reason is not that we can play d5 the reason is that e6 blunts the bishop and we don't even have to rush with them i mean we'll play d5 but we don't have to rush for the move with the move d5 we can also develop our knight uh which we will do now so we are just the reason i'm playing fast is because i'm i'm simply developing my pieces this check is useless because i would have developed it anyway and now the queen could be in the crosshairs of what what should we do here how do we at least try to punish him for this untoward and sort of slightly awkward move we can play rookie and we immediately create the pinning potential he has to which he does castles now the first thing we would check uh for in this position is a discovery and bishop d6 comes to mind i'm sure some people are thinking this but uh remember that when you discover a piece you can move the piece and defend the other piece so if bishop d6 the queen can come out to d2 and simultaneously protect the bishop so there's no point in making this discovery let's save it for a rainy day now when i say save it for a rainy day i mean let's instead complete our development now again remember to apply the key principle when you're developing your pieces do not obstruct the stuff that you want to keep so where should we put this bishop let's put it on f5 let's put it on f5 and let's see what he does maybe bishop d6 will become good again for example if he plays knight bd2 i don't think he will but if he plays knight bd2 for whatever reason uh bishop d6 will win a piece he goes queen d2 he gets afraid of the discovery now okay the nereditsky approach here is to identify what do i have against sunny day who you're still phoning robert man if only i was commentating with him tomorrow so the the neredinsky approach is to see that the pawn on h3 is what i is what's called a hook and a hook is a pawn that is outside of its normal position near a king that can be used either as a lever to sacrifice on or for other pawns to advance and then to use that pawn to weaken the king position so let's go queen d7 and just sack on h3 opening up his king position our queen will be in the attack it's a very typical idea in all sorts of positions particularly in ones where you've completed your development and the reason the sacrifice is not that risky is because we get two pawns for the piece so even if the attack backfires we will have a significant amount of material for the piece now is this sacrifice sound i don't think so i don't think it is particularly sound but i don't think it's bad because we're attacking his knight his queen is super awkward he would love to play knight bd2 here developing his knight and defending the knight on f3 but uh sadly he cannot and uh we also have this g4 square available for the queen should the occasion arise speedchest championship tomorrow all right so queen d1 now how do we increase the pressure and the heat on the king side how do we add some tabasco sauce to the attack how do we add some tabasco sauce yeah let's add some tabasco sauce let's add some tabasco sauce now be careful about the idea of knight e4 because remember that his bishop also controls h2 his bishop also controls h2 so it's not that simple uh and in fact i would take on d5 if i were white just fearlessly but people just don't play like this i guess he proved me wrong normally but um we have some really cool ideas here actually we have some really cool ideas here so what can we do in this in this position how can we play so bishop h4 uh would be a great idea if it weren't for well the presence of the knight on f3 if it weren't for the presence of the knight on f3 then we would be able to go bishop h4 and bishop takes f2 so how can we how can we pave the way for the bishop to come to h4 can we distract this knight from f3 yeah we can we can we can go knight t4 now this is again this is on sound he can refute this and win uh if he plays very accurately so i'm banking on the fact that he doesn't play accurately uh because he's 1573 but i would not do this against a gm for example i'm just trying to show how attacking works and often in blitz you can get away with stuff like this so let's see how he reacts to this now we're trying to distract this knight so that we can put a bishop on h4 and threaten checkmate on f2 when you're attacking you want to make sure that not only are you bringing pieces into the game but you're doing it in a very targeted way you want to do it in a way that such that the pieces actually accomplish something you go c3 he doesn't take the knight so if we take his knight he takes with the queen we certainly don't want that we don't want the queen trade um but this knight from d4 can actually go somewhere kind of nice where can this knight from d4 go so that it's still kind of relevant in the attack go to f5 uh and on f5 it potentially can go to h4 and again distract the knight from f3 should the occasion arise and queen g2 checkmate will be threatened so we're sort of staying on idle idol isn't we're idling the engine here and we're actually threatening knight h4 because he takes on h4 we will kill two birds with one stone we will move the bishop in and that bishop will threaten checkmate on f2 so let's see how he chooses to defend against that you guys can begin to appreciate here how difficult it is to defend against the style of play even if an attack is unsound from an engine's perspective for a human being to defend against all this stuff is incredibly difficult uh is incredibly difficult i know that express i don't like that expression either but he's doing it incredibly well so knight to e5 uh okay so how should we proceed how should we proceed should we take the knight so we if we go bishop h4 he he can take on on g4 ah this is very nice we can actually go bishop h4 i think this actually takes some calculation from me but we can actually go bishop h4 so here's the calculation is not that difficult um because we are threatening checkmate he can take our knight with two different pieces he can take it with the queen or he can take it with a knight if he takes it with the queen then as i've explained many times he should always check for the undefended pieces the rook only one loses its support so we actually do take the queen then we take on e1 we win the rook that same rook pins his knight to his rook so even though he has two pieces for a rook we have some compensation the second way that he can take is with a knight but then his queen is overloaded it guards both g4 and e1 so we can take on e1 and then take on g4 this is the third move but this doesn't do much we just move the king away and the problem is renewed the king is perfectly safe he decides on this move so now we will win the rook back he does get rid of the attack but in return uh the attack in a certain sense continues let's bring our other piece into the game rook to f8 attacking the bishop so this is again a very combative game our opponent played extremely well he defended extremely well but he's still far from out of the woods because this rook anyone look how it's paralyzing his entire position and that this i believe was a mistake well actually not but again we can well we can test him a little bit let's test him a little bit yeah 97 is the move that i had in mind uh attacking both bishops at the same time if he moves his bishop to d2 which would be i believe the right move then we can actually win back the two pieces for a rook we can play rook takes b1 and then take the other bishop with our knight he finds instead the move bishop to d6 okay so he's pinning our knight to our rook if we take his bishop he takes a rook so let's move the rook away from the pen uh simultaneously trying to transfer the rook to g5 and attack the knight on g4 and pinning the knight so let's see what he ends up doing in this position see what he ends up doing in this position okay uh he's taking a little bit too much time and if you're actually trying to improve at blitz you can notice that the style of play makes it very difficult for people to come up with moves fast and so in a certain sense it's favorable to play like this because uh because by definition you're you're you're sucking the time off of your opponent's clock now what can we do here let's go rook g5 yes the move is king and now what do we do after he moves his king recognizing that the rook is pending the night what do we do i lived there freshman year or sorry sophomore year how do we enhance the attack on the night we got booked and we take the night and we are in very good shape we are up in exchange so this was only 26 moves which is kind of interesting because it looked much longer there was a lot of interesting moments how could he have refuted this attack so the key moment occurred in i think this position had he taken the knight on d4 we would have played bishop to h4 threatening checkmate on f2 and in this position i believe he could have played the move bishop to g2 the purpose of this move is to attack the queen and to open up the f1 square for his king we can still take on f2 but he shifts his king to f1 there's a lot going on here but basically this boils down to two simple facts fact one is that white is up two pieces so white can give away something and he can still be up material fact two is that black's queen is hanging so if i take on e1 he takes with his queen we have a situation where both queens are hanging in such situations as i've explained you want to look for desperado sacrifices giving up your queen for the maximum we can do that with queen takes g2 the problem as i've explained goes back to fact one white is up two pieces white is no longer up two pieces but he is still up one and i have some pawns for it but by and large it's an end game so white is much better okay so again this is one of those things that looks super complicated but it's not that hard to calculate and people shouldn't be afraid of this kind of chaos because you really want to zero in on the observations that that make a position tick you want to kind of really figure out what's going on and uh you shouldn't you shouldn't be afraid just because of the way that a position that a position looks okay all right great so let's do maybe one more game um one second please so if you played accurately he would have been better yes that's what i'm saying but i warned you guys that's why i believe the sacrifice was unsound and if i was playing a gm i would have probably played p5 to try to drive his bishop in with c4 that would have been a good you know that would have been a solid move just to improve the position you could have also dropped the bishop away to fa you'll see this idea very often in gm games opening up the open file for for the rook could have also gone well h6 might allow the reciprocal sacrifice on the other side a lot of you said fifa can you play cochrane gabby yes the next time our opponent plays the petrov i will play play the cochrane game but i'm ready to destroy a 1600 this time who plays the scandinavian okay now in the scandinavian we know already that knight c3 is the best move to attack the queen and develop a knight now we occupy the center with d4 and now we follow the ancient wisdom of petrov who said to develop the knight uh to f3 first i don't think we played this guy actually i disagree now he's just moving his pawns and there is no particular way in which we should respond no no we did not play this guy the last time uh there is no particular way that we should respond to this other than to continue development uh are you sure we played him well i'm looking at my game history i don't see him but anyways bishop d3 is simple oh it's just the overlay hasn't changed there we go the over that's so weird it contained the name of the last opponent but the moves are transmitted transmitting correctly okay so let's centralize the knight that was really funny and develop our bishop so right now i'm just developing all my pieces i'm not doing anything crazy which is why i'm moving fast okay now what should we do in this yeah i was like what what should we do in this position let's bring our queen out to f3 which is a very typical way to apply pressure on his position notice that i'm also giving up the d4 pawn and there is a reason that i'm doing that and the reason that i'm doing that is because he's so poorly developed if he takes on d4 with his queen his queen is going to be incredibly vulnerable to attack now what should we do in this position we can win a pawn it's the rye lopez demon it's ray lopez loose pieces drop off boom if he takes we take the bishop loose pieces drop off that's a free pawn there's no reason not to take it okay he goes knight d5 so he attacks the bishop let's take it now we do need to move the knight away so let's move it back to c3 okay so we're up pawn we're in good shape he's probably gonna go here nope he's gonna go f6 okay now what should we do in this situation and i'll give you guys a hint we can create a counter threat against his pawn on h7 because we have a bishop on t3 that's very very strong a lot of people might think the move is queen h5 but be very very careful because if we oh we got another oh my goodness oh my lance got another one from gem jam another 10 000 are you kidding me i will have a good night we're gonna go queen h3 so that g6 doesn't come with tempo what a day this has been in culminating in two bombs dropped by gem jim now we're going to move our knight away now that we've provoked the weaknesses in his king side and king h8 pin what does this tell us about what we should do thank you so much what should we do here boom if he will take his opponent on g6 yes and the game is almost over that is the second and again we do the same thing we did earlier we just take a pawn and we drop the bishop back okay now we have a really nice tactic how do i see this tactic what i'm seeing is that the queen defends the pawn on h7 against checkmate we know that when the queen defends a pawn that's not a good situation we can take a third pawn and if he takes the queen oh sorry if he takes the knight we can take on h7 and the game will be boy and lodge the game will be over now he's gonna go knight 97. now most people here would take the rook the thing about this is we can do a lot more than take the rook we can do a lot better because we have this h file open we can attack down that h file following the ancient wisdom of the greats with knight takes h7 we don't need to take bishop takes h7 because if bishop h7 we give up the knight and that same knight can be used to go to h7 himself and this is just going to be completely winning we are up four pawns and we are crushing him with an attack okay now let's find the checkmate he has also given up his rook but there is mate in two moves how do we find the checkmate we realize that we can move the knight away with a discover check our second mission in this position is to cover the g8 square because after we move the knight that is going to be his only escape square for the king and that's how you often when you're discovering a check and you want to checkmate your opponent's king the way that you want to think about the discovers can i move my piece away such that that very same piece somehow contributes the mating mechanism as you guys can see the move is knight f6 check the game is over it's mate very simple game we just developed our pieces and this is why i don't recommend opening such as this candy to a lot of players in the intermediate range because they tend to do stuff like this giving us a huge lead in development the one thing i'd like to talk about is what would have happened if we had if he had gone queen takes d4 now when you look at this move the immediate thing you should notice is the relationship between the queens so if this bishop could move away with check then that would win the queen so you need to find a tactic in order to force the king onto a square where you could deliver check to this looks like a complicated combination but the logic behind it no pun intended is very simple you're just trying to get the king onto a square or you can deliver the discovery check so he couldn't do this and that meant he had to allow us to continue putting our pieces on very good squares now we play knight takes p5 using the fact that the bishop is unprotected we drop the knight back we attack h7 if he had taken the knight we take it check and checkmate is very simple we can even checkmate with the pawn d takes c5 and um after knight g4 i mean his position has already been softened up we take on g6 we take on f6 distracting the queen notice how our own queen and i've mentioned this often the queen is often sort of the supporting actress a queen defends on g2 and simultaneously is responsible for uh basically he's the agent of of checkmate what if he took the pawn later that's a good question so if he took the pawn here we would have just defended the knight and then brought the other look how amazing white's position is uh even upon down so basically this is just completely overwhelming because white's got pieces on amazing squares and you can slide the queen over to h3 and create threats against the h7 pawn so if he goes h6 you can already give a discovery and win the queen uh what if yeah so there's there's a bunch of tactical details here but the long and short of it is that white's got a huge attack and the rest was very straightforward now just moving knight back to f6 and covering g8 we could have also taken the rook of course with total devastation but we decided to play a little bit more precisely
