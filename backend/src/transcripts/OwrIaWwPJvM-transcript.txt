now is everybody ready for the speed run we're gonna play one or two games we're gonna play five minutes again we're almost up to fifteen hundred this is where things get interesting let's get on with it ladies and gentlemen [Music] i'm gonna raise the sparkling water to my man trav man with 15 subs to the community what a freaking beast that guy is we have a philidor now as we go as we know in the philadelphia we want to open up the center and develop our pieces i'm playing this fast because we've okay what is he doing thank you ruffle for the front now this is a great example of our opponent doing something weird and we don't need to especially modify our strategy because he's doing anything weird he's not attacking our knight we don't need to move it where should we develop this bishop now e5 would be a little bit too much we would just give up the pawn so in this case we haven't even barely begun our development let's uh let's develop our pieces to active squares there's just nothing that we need to do differently because he's put a bishop on f6 so let's just develop all of our pieces let's put the bishop on e3 to lend uh further support to this knight on d4 now we've developed all of our pieces and the time has come for us to start expanding a little bit on another side of the board uh what move comes to mind there's a very typical move in such positions where we expand a little bit on the queen side we create like a pawn umbrella and this pawn umbrella can be used for various purposes now a4 is usually good only if you're sort of preventing b5 so let's play f4 to expand a little bit on the king's side okay so now is a great time to play a4 to prevent him sorry to prevent him from playing b5 okay now our pieces are sufficiently active to where we can basically now go for his throat and uh when i say go for his throat what i really mean is is accumulate pieces on the king's side and and go for an attack uh and when you hear the word accumulate pieces the first piece you should immediately think of is the queen some people are probably thinking about queen f3 but that's not the most active score for the queen always look for the most active squares for each one of your pieces what is the most active square for the queen queen g4 walks right into that pin yeah a lot of people saying queen g4 but be very careful about walking into a discovery there is a square that i think some people are are worried about putting the queen on that is the square h5 but there's no no need to worry because how can the queen be touched the queen cannot be touched here it can barely be attacked and um i know a lot of people i know i've warned people not to play around with their queen particularly early on but we've reached a level where there are exceptions to the rule and here the queen is perfectly invulnerable let's keep the bishop on this diagonal and i will explain in a moment after the game why bishop b3 is inferior thank you again travman for that massive hype okay where should we go where should the snipe go think not about the next move think about the night's ultimate destination this is going to help people find the right move knight f5 is normal that's fine but i don't really want to allow it to be taken i'm going to play the move knight to f3 now where is the knight where is the knight going ultimately in the end it's potentially going to g5 but emphasis on the word potentially we're not going to g5 yet we're going to try to wait for black to take our knight on c3 okay so black is played c4 which shuts out our bishop why is c4 a thing because of the knight on v6 should we take the knight on b6 no because we don't want to give away this beautiful bishop which is holding everything together so let us play a5 that's why we played a4 so to be able to chase the knight away so that the bishop can rejoin the game when bishop takes c4 and then we're going to be up a pawn and all of our pieces are going to be in the game we're going to be in great shape okay final destination yes great movie yeah remove the defender but don't rush to take the defender sometimes you can just remove it this is another very typical example of overloading the knight is protected by the pawn this pawn on d6 is just visually very weak how can this pawn on d6 be distracted rook d1 is absolutely a good move but we can also play a little bit more directly with the movie five just immediately sort of removing the defender from oh god i got my queen trapped and i just made a big blunder my i just made a big blunder actually so knight f4 traps the queen knight f4 traps the queen yep queen has no squares but how do you get out of this situation you put on your daniel nereditsky hat and you're like okay let's sack the queen knight 65 yeah so this happens i mean i make mistakes too and i just made a big one but we have to maintain our composure and keep looking for chances okay yeah i might have to okay so uh he's made a mistake by playing 96 and the simple truth is that we've given up our queen but we have a tremendous amount of material in return for the queen we have a very active position and um first of all i don't want anybody to be under the illusion that i don't make mistakes or that i am somehow perfect so in what form is our compensation for the queen first of all let's be realistic we have a rook and a piece for the queen that's already basically equivalent second of all i'll look at all of our pieces they are perfectly centrally placed and now we can already win the queen back with what move we can basically just crash through with what move we don't need to play knight takes f7 but why not rook takes f7 just immediately taking it to the queen so from the time that we blundered the queen i blundered the queen to the time that we're winning is about three moves and [Music] that's just the reality the queen before does this create any actual threats does it attack the bishop does this move it actually attack the bishop no we can just continue activating all of our pieces we can bring the other rook into the game we can start thinking about how to deliver checkmate here which is not going to be easy he takes the pawn now this guy is very good um let me think please oh hmm i did actually think absolutely beautiful idea oh my good oh my goodness there's some beautiful beautiful concepts okay let's just hope he takes them one sec i i gotta do this just because of chess beauty no and he sees it oh okay one sec nice sorry he saw the correct night to take okay now i'm playing with some serious fire now i'm playing with some serious fire uh but his king is in is in huge trouble here obviously we're going to create the possibility for a discovered check we'll come check and we are in great shape he's got to take the knight and give up his queen he doesn't what do we do what does white do in this position rook f8 and it's mate so we're good we have enough pieces to deliver checkmate with and um this guy was good i mean this guy was i actually came up with a really nice tactical idea instead of this i'll show you guys okay so that was close and first of all these kinds of sudden things i also tend to miss so what did i miss here like i grabbed the knight immediately because i thought this one a piece but i didn't calculate deeply enough the move f takes e5 would have been completely winning because we didn't even need the extra night i mean our just because their position is just completely overwhelming uh but let's see the end of the game i know people are excited so this move96 i saw a really really beautiful mate if he played queen takes e5 which i expected from him let's find this mate together what do you guys think is the first move of the combination there is really only one possible check if you can notice the pin check king can't take the rook because of the rook knight can't take because bishop is spinning okay okay let's continue um it doesn't even work uh it's just bad so yeah guys this is a bad calculation honestly i'm out of gas for today probably we'd have to go rook h8 give up the rook and then win the queen back and white is white is better uh but this is this is not what i had in mind initially that's just sort of the backup option the line that i had in mind initially is bishop d3 rook f7 and here i miscalculated thinking thinking that my bishop was still on c4 now if the bishop was on c4 then white would have a beautiful mating idea what would be white's mating idea in this position and this is just me running out of gas unfortunately and miscalculating but nonetheless white to play in this position yeah okay sacking the rook in order to pave the way for the bishop and that paves the way for the night this is checkmate very unusual checkmating idea by the way so there are some cool stuff here there is some cool stuff here but sadly i lost my objectivity completely and so the game was close but other than that everything else we did was perfectly understandable yeah so so this is a very instructive mistake like do not rush with anything because disaster can strike at any moment in any position there's it doesn't make any sense that this uh that this that this traps the queen but but it does uh and and that's just the way the chest works it sometimes doesn't make too much sense by the way the best um the best move for black here would have been queen to g5 forking the knight and threatening checkmate on g2 this would have put me in tremendous trouble so that's how gm's lose lose games to weaker opponents is like you get sloppy you fall asleep and can happen to anybody all right guys last game and then i'm gonna go to sleep because i'm quite exhausted but let's play one last game and i will stream again tomorrow fifth sixteen hundred let's go let's play a silicon again that bishop c4 is all right so this guy is playing very weird chess b3 he's wasting time trying to fianchetto his bishop which doesn't make too much sense let's just develop our knights and then you guys know the drill in such positions the best thing to do is to play e6 and prepare the move d5 and uh he's already lost a bishop because his bishop will his bishop is only one square but that square is going to it results in the loss of a bishop and the loss of the game this is a tactical pattern that i think most of you probably are aware of uh well the fiance doesn't make sense because it's just weird to develop bishops in this way also there is the chess principle nights before bishops and uh he's kind of violating that now we're going to force him to develop his knight and what do we do with this night what do we do with this the id4 yeah exactly winning the night yeah we don't care about that he's got to give up a pawn for the night uh and we're just going to be up a full piece for no compensation okay and this stuff people will try to do to you we can play bishop e7 we can play bishop b6 it doesn't matter as long as we can cover the check and we he doesn't even give get a pawn for the uh for the night now i'm gonna ask people a trick question can we castle is it possible to castle here don't get caught it is actually possible to castle because after queen takes c7 we play rook to e8 and we pin the king right so i've told people this before like sometimes our brain tells us something is impossible but before concluding that by the way defending the bishop before concluding that it's impossible we have to ask ourselves what happens if we do it anyway and that awakens in you the possibility of finding something like this okay so we are up a full piece there's nothing else to really talk about now we can just go about trading as many pieces as possible queen on e3 is very clearly vulnerable we can attack this queen by shifting the knight over to d5 opening up a channel between the bishops we can also take the knight so we can start trading pieces here and ruining his pawn structure the game is essentially over and um yeah we're going to take all of the pieces we're going to be up at night and his king's side is going to be completely ruined and we are going to approach 1500 so i'm anticipating either resignation or he's gonna play a couple more moves these triple pawns remind me of the magnus versus tara yeah some people might be disappointed by the fact that we have triple pawn okay now we win another piece we take the knight removing the defender from the bishop and then we're going to be up two pieces the rest you guys basically know the drill we're going to put a rook on the 8 we don't forget to deploy the remainder of our pieces in a situation when we have a lot of extra material he simply resigns in a perfect game to end today's speed run yeah so just up two pieces now why is it a bad idea to film kettle the bishop here first of all the move d3 people should rule out uh because because the bishop has no way back uh and and and to do such a thing particularly when your bishop has come outside the pawn chain is just very dangerous uh so he should have at least probably defended this pawn or maybe even not defended it just got bishop b2 uh but but after d3 e6 it's already very difficult to save the bishop he has to do something like d4 or b4 that's obviously very undesirable so this would have been yeah this move is is almost a killer almost immediately
