[Music] jack 75 let's go e4 and uh again we see a philidor which we've seen a lot and we know that the move is d4 opening up the center at this point i will not spend a long time on the opening you guys know the drill we're just developing pieces naturally and we do know those of you who are attentive to previous streams castling here is inaccurate does somebody know why and can somebody tell me how we avoid this particular type of trap why is castling a very natural move not that good because of knight takes e4 knight takes c4 and then d5 exactly so how do we avoid that where do we tuck one of our pieces away so that this isn't a thing what's up tommy h3 doesn't actually do anything against the idea of knight takes c4 we go bishop to b3 we talk the bishop away this is a very typical move in many types of positions and now we can very safely castle now it is true that he can okay he doesn't do it he puts his knight on e5 that is a bit of a weird move because what can we do with this knight and uh in a manner conducive to our general kingside ideas which is to start the attack let's go f4 chase the night away the knight can go to many different places he can go back to d7 which is what he does and now we have to decide how we are going to continue the attack there's many ways of doing it there's many good moves here i think but one idea that comes to my mind is to prepare perhaps the pawn break e5 trying to open up the center we can't do that immediately and i want you guys to be very patient here because if we play e5 immediately we will lose the pawn i also don't want to go rookie one and the reason i don't want to go rookie one is because when we go e5 if and when and he takes and we take i want this rook to be on f1 because it will be uniquely poised to exploit the opening of the f-file so this is forward thinking we want to keep the rook here in anticipation of the if the file getting opened so this is a pretty big balls task we can go queen e2 but we know from our principle that we shouldn't assign a task to a piece of higher value when we can assign it to a piece of lower value and that piece of lower value is the knight this is a retreating move but it's a very strong retreating move because we are preparing something very aggressive but let's not go e5 immediately let's not go e5 yet if we go e5 immediately we allow the queen trade so first we're going to get the queen to e1 this kills two birds with one stone first of all prepare c5 second of all we prepared to bring our queen onto a very strong attacking post and now we can go e5 adam thank you for the prime appreciate it you can see how methodically we're playing here okay what do we do how do we proceed in this position and actually i'm asking you guys a pretty simple question pretty trick question because you might be looking for something extraordinary but i always remind people never to forget about your development we have not completed our development we have an entire side of the board that is not developed thank you queen g3 blunders the queen we just develop our pieces now yes we give up our bishop that's painful because the bishop is skewering the diagonal but that is okay no mission way may thank you for the prime why is that okay because his pieces are all over the board his knight is in the corner and now he's gonna get blown out of the gym here he doesn't even decide to take my bishop what do we do now how do we continue tightening the screw as we go knight t5 very good you know work centralizing the knight we are not attacking the pawn but we are centralizing the knight the knight is controlling many squares we could have also gone h3 to get rid of this very annoying pin i should have gone h that was that was a better move knight d5 was a little bit impulsive but that's okay because black is so passive here we can afford to even go back to c3 if we want to if we wanted which is what we're going to do and i want to show people that it's okay to admit your mistakes in chess and i guess in life too although we don't like to do that very much anymore okay now let's go h3 to get rid of this pin i told you guys a principal principle yesterday that helps you assess whether pins are dangerous does somebody remember what this principle is okay what do we do now sorry i'm getting i found peter gionatos is distracting me okay um what do we do now how do we continue well what do we need to look for here what we need to look at is the knight on h5 we need to make the judgment that our pieces are so well placed that we can now proceed to basically the kick-ass phase and the knight on h5 is in the corner and it is trapped we just win the night uh-huh are you are you here how do we know if the pin is dangerous sorry so if a pinned piece is defended by a pawn then the pin is then the pin tends to be a little bit less dangerous if the pinned piece is not defended by a pawn then normally the pin should be considered quite dangerous that's not a hard fast rule but it's a good shorthand for assessing whether you need to deal with a pin immediately because the bishop is pinning the knight but okay f5 is well that's a terrible move because he blunders another knight now a lot of people here would make the knee-jerk response and take the knight on h5 but let's spend a second looking for a better move if you notice the move f5 has opened up the diagonal for the bishop the knight on e6 is protected only by the queen and the queen is overloaded why is it overloaded what can we do in order to get this queen out of e8 such that it will not no longer defend the knight on e6 come on guys give me the move rook takes the a bingo taking one knight and then taking the other in succession we're going to be up two pieces and the game is going to be over simple and strong simple and strong and keep cameras on 14 for the prime let's keep the hype going i'm loving it okay so we're up two pieces negative 1456 he gives us more stuff but we got to be a little bit careful here i think we can just take this guy i mean he's probably intending queen d4 check thinking that he forks us okay well that's just an empty check we can move our king up and uh thank you deck jumper now how do we win a position like this we win it by by centralizing our pieces and essentially going after his king we don't need to trade anything one way that i immediately am thinking about of going after his king is to build a battery against the h7 square building a battery is is sort of one of the key attacking principles in any position but here in particular because he doesn't have a light squared bishop this battery is going to be essentially unstoppable he's actually helping us build it uh by sending the bishop over to d3 i would have gone there anyway and our next move is going to be queen e4 with humongous threats against h7 1994 is possible as well these positions are so winning that we can basically do anything we want and win it okay he's moving my pieces yep exactly queen h queen e4 threatening checkmate he's got to play g6 in order to prevent it which is incredibly exposing then we're going to move our knight and follow follow that with with uh hg6 he can take our pawn but then again he exposes the attack on the h7 square thank you barry mccockinner for gifting to jay hubes loving the support right now what's typically more powerful rooker bishop well the queen bishop battery is my personal favorite as we get the rook to an open file newly created okay rook g8 we're gonna take and now we're gonna go we're gonna go knight g3 bringing the knight into the attack he's threatening h4 let's win a third piece with a fork there's so many ways of winning this position that i'm not even really commenting on the way that i choose now we're gonna get i don't even care about the night we're up so many pieces that whatever i'm just gonna get the queen of six i'm gonna whatever just bishop h6 here forcing the queen trade which actually also helps me create a pass pawn which i will promote with checkmate because this game is boxed in all right good game um very quickly and i'm gonna do one or two then maybe switch back to blitz essentially he should have taken the bishop i mean this bishop actually won us the game he should have taken the bishop but here we play a takes b3 get the rook to d1 and uh eventually we're going to chase this bishop away from g4 that's why they say knights on the rim are grim now sometimes nights on the rim are good if they're accomplishing something specific but here one good way to think about knights on the rim is whether they have an evacuation route going forward and here the knight from h5 does not have an evacuation round it is trapped it is very dangerous to have a piece like this which has no which a is is on the side of the board where it can be attacked and b has no evacuation path why not queen h4 instead i assume of g4 so queen h4 would have been possible as well yeah this would have i was a little bit concerned that he would take the knight on c3 though and now we run into a little bit of trouble because our rook on d1 loses its defender we have to play rook take state and now he takes with the queen now remember he is currently up a piece because he's captured our knight we cannot take two pieces at the same time and our queen is hanging we've got too many things to deal with here we have to take one of the pieces either take the queen and then take the bishop and then he can get an evacuation route for his night or we take the knight but we are no longer up a piece he moves his bishop away and he's fine so the reason i rejected queen h4 is because i was a little bit worried that the rook on d1 would be poorly protected uh seeing that the bishop can capture the knight i didn't calculate this but it was an intuitive judgment film okay um so instead of playing f5 he should have just given up one piece but he decided to give up two i mean that's often what happens uh when people panic and uh that basically was the whole game i mean i didn't really do anything specific i think the important moment was here i mean i'm not claiming that white is even better here but i'm trying to illustrate a concept which is that when you come up with an idea you want to find the best way to execute that idea and the higher rated you get the more complex the executions become here a lot of people want to go rookie one but to remind everybody the rook on f1 is uniquely poised to exploit that f-file once it opens so not only do you want to position pieces on good squares and in a sense in a sense using our terminology the rook has a lot of potential energy it has very very low kinetic energy because it's staring at a pawn it's on its almost on its initial square but it has tremendous potential if the f-file opens and that's what makes it hard to appreciate this rook's this rick's power okay any questions before i go on if queenie ii well queen e2 another drawback is that in such a situation the knight on d4 loses its protector so the reason i wanted to keep the queen on d1 for the time being is that when i play e5 i anticipated the d-file opening and when the d-file opens the knight on d4 might be caught on the crossfire and it would be nice if the queen remained there to defend the knight let's continue okay lexman 18 let's go e4 and let's play either the italian or the roy lopez okay he goes d5 the elephant gambit we've faced it many times on sound but not as bad as people make it out to be we will take on d5 now the normal continuation here is e4 yep so this guy actually knows what he's doing and if i if my memory serves me correct then we actually do not move the knight here can somebody tell me what possible move we have that doesn't involve moving the knight how do we what is the alternative way yup queen e2 and this pawn is going to be picked off because he doesn't have any pieces out to defend the spawn what do we do how do we get to this pawn on e4 now that it's defended by f5 we don't have much time to waste we need to operate quickly so we go d3 we go d3 now we continue to attack this pawn we can take once but there's no need to do that just yet so what should we do and this is actually a very interesting moment so we could go knight g5 but i would prefer to develop while we attack the pawn so let's go knight to c3 and now let's take the pawn on e4 once let's see what he recaptures with he plays bishop takes c3 to take away this makes a lot of sense to take away the attacker of the e4 pawn but here's the thing remember that we're upon up from a previous marriage we are upon up still and even if we don't get to this pawn that's fine as long as we can protect the pawn on d5 can we protect the pawn on d5 can we protect the pawn on d5 yeah so c4 is possible but i want to look for something better because here is my fear with the move c4 if we play c4 and he castles we are uncastled and not only are we on castle but the queen on e2 is blocking our bishop from developing so i would anticipate some trouble tactically speaking if he gets this big lead in development now this refocuses our priorities and our priority becomes not saving the pawn but actually stopping him from castling if we can stop him from castling we equalize the playing field not only that we have two bishops that can be very useful in an open board can we stop him from castling yes we can bishop a3 the move queen b5 is very tempting but as i've reminded people always remember that checks can be blocked when you give a check you shouldn't assume that the king has to move move bishop a3 prevents him from castling by taking under control the f8 square now the queen has come out to d5 which immediately signals to us that we can deploy some of our pieces with tempo while attacking the queen now which piece in particular do i have my eye on and how do we deploy it indeed rook d1 and we can see that his king is in big trouble it might not seem that way right now but it is he attacks our bishop he attacks our pawn can we defend both at the same time yes we can bishop b4 obviously we give up a2 but as people should be realizing by now our priority isn't pawns our priority is to go for checkmate and uh if that requires okay he doesn't take the pawn now he actually is also playing quite quite well but i think we can we can make this happen now we want to get the c4 pawn if we get the c4 pawn then that that constitutes an immediate avenue toward his king how do we go after this e4 pawn is the key question we have to ask ourselves and the answer presents itself simply the move is knight g5 attacking on e4 what we've done is we're buying our self-time because he finally goes c5 finally interfering with the bishop he can castle but it's a little bit too late because what move can we now play despite the fact we ask ourselves the sam shanklin question the knee-jerk response for people is to move the bishop away but we ask ourselves what happens if we do it anyway what happens if we take on e4 anyway and what we realize is that we create discovered attack potential against the king which means that if he takes our bishop we can at the very least recapture his knight with a double check and send his king out he decides to castle but now we can do what this knight on e4 combines with the bishop on b4 we take on c5 we win the exchange and he's going to be down a whole lot of material provided that we can complete our development which shouldn't be that difficult now that we've basically destroyed his remaining forces yes i will show everything after the game now this is a very instructive moment we are still behind the development so it would be a good idea to trade queens if the the occasion permits but we shouldn't limit ourselves to that thinking our bishop is hanging in our pawn on c3 is saying can we defend both at the same time rook d8 would blunder the pawn on c3 with rather devastating consequences so don't look only at your ideas look also your opponent's ideas the threat is not only king takes f8 it is also queen takes c3 we need to combine both and we do that by playing bishop to b4 sliding the bishop back again do not be afraid of retreating moves the other benefit of this move is that rook t8 is going to come with check driving his king out that's a pretty big deal we also have the idea of queen c 4 chuck forcing the queen trait so depending on what he does we either go after his king or we go after the queen trade he can't prevent both at the same time at least i don't see a way to do that particularly okay so which one should we go for now maybe even both which one does your intuition calls for definitely rook d8 i mean this looks like it's very close to checkmate check on f8 driving his king out even further and in such a situation a lot of people struggle finding follow-ups and they forget that pawns are full-fledged attackers when you can't find a way to get to a king like this you need to involve your pawns pawns can be that deciding factor which turned the attack from just strong to decisive which fun can we involve here let's go g4 with tempo attacking the bishop not only is this a good move from an attacking perspective but if you notice the bishop on f1 we can actually fianchetto it just for a little bit of safety for a little life insurance we can always castle short if things go terribly wrong and we need to escape so it's a good idea to play in this way where you defend and attack kind of at the same time because then you insure yourself against disasters if a disaster happens at least we know that we will always be able to castle in fact we can just castle so that we don't even have to worry about it i don't want the headache of that king being out in the open okay he gives up another rook he was of course pinned and that's the reason why we could afford to spend all this time okay that doesn't do anything so let's deploy our last remaining piece which is not doing anything and let's combine attacking the king with just taking up all of the free pawns and pieces that present themselves here there's no science to winning a position like this tommy shelby oh look at this man go five gifted subs from from the unlikeliest source tommy thank you thank you for the five gifted that 1 30 hype we're feeling it yeah i think he is easy well we don't have to worry about a measly pawn we can drop our queen all the way to e8 with checkmate um so this is completely winning yeah it's over we are up too many pieces he thinks he's thinking but i mean there's no way he can salvage this or survive for more than a couple moves yeah i'm in eastern time zone all right i blundered eight i did blunder eight actually that's really funny i forgot that he was well the hilarious thing is i didn't even see that the rook was hanging but the funny thing is if he takes my rook we take his knight we force liquidation into a position where we're up a rook so that's actually a good thing that's fine um i actually forgot that he's attacking my rope to be honest i didn't understand what the purpose of d5 was i made the same mistake i tell everybody not to make i didn't ask myself what the threat was because i let my guard down we're up so many pieces that i kind of let my guard down but as it turns out we're so overwhelmingly better that even a blunder turns out to be a decent move thank you natsukis appreciate it okay yeah i'm surprised he hasn't taken it yet i mean maybe he he senses something this move does nothing yeah i i dismissed it too early and that's a common cause of blunders you just dismiss the move of your opponent because it looks stupid and he resigns so he recognizes the the uh futility of further resistance and he resides so by the way if he takes my rook i take his i can even take with my queen which is a funny thing because bishop takes bishop take forks forex is queen and king he's got to take and we're up a look okay um so that was a relatively straightforward game there were a couple of interesting moments the first was the smoke queen e2 which pins his pawn to his king and basically he bites off a little bit more than he can chew and here this this was the critical moment in the whole game because most people would play c4 uh and that's a completely understandable move you are defending your extra pawn but the issue is that he castles and as i explained not only does he is he castled and we aren't but the second bad thing is that this queen on e2 uh actually obstructs the development of our bishop so he starts developing a very big initiative white is probably still better but i didn't want to allow a situation like this and so we played bishop a3 giving up the pawn back which allows us to open the d file and get it get a huge attack against his king we have simply more pieces in the game than he does and he's not able to to hold everything together so takes if he takes the bishop we we take with the discovered check and that is devastating and the rest is uh it's very simple bishop c5 bishop f8 bringing the bishop back when you have this position is also important tommy shelby is challenging me interesting i gotta play him all right i gotta play tommy i can't pass up this opportunity we've never played before then i'll continue the game he is a legend okay so he's playing the petrov where we take on e5 and he plays the stafford gambit if only i had made a video refuting the stafford gambit well this is my time for testing d3 is the move now bishop c5 in the stafford is typical okay bishop c5 in the stafford is is typical and i actually have to remember my own refutation if i remember correctly and just give me a second to recall this i think the move i recommended is bishop b2 first covering the g4 square and now we play a very important move c3 the this is the move that refutes the stafford because it prepares the move d4 shutting the bishop out taking it out of commission and ending all tricks associated with the f2 square that is the key black is simply a pawn down and he is essentially losing uh there is nothing to it i made a 25 minute video on youtube where i analyzed this in great depth if you are interested you are welcome to watch now not to overstate the case here we still need to win the game we are up a pawn but we still need to bring all our pieces out and we need to convert this which will not be trivial but we've done the job of of ending the immediate tricks so let's now develop our pieces the knight will come out to d2 a nice little square notice that our nice little pawn chain in the center is well protected he's probably going to castle long which is fine and if he castles along we need to start thinking about ways that we can attack his king on the queen side what can we do here to start the attack on his king well one thing we can do first of all he wants to play c5 and undermine our center which is kind of annoying can we do both things at once we go b4 first of all we prepare the pawn storm on the queen side second of all we stop him from playing c5 which is very important the other thing we do is we prepare potentially the maneuver of the knight to c5 uh where it will be sitting on an outpost if he takes it and we open up the b file and we can use that b file to deliver checkmate potentially tommy is great um okay so let's see what he does let's see what he does yeah this is what drives people crazy now he sacks the wow that is a very strong move actually well that's a very interesting i'm not sure it's that strong but it's interesting because he takes on d4 we'll have to we have to deal with a couple threats here and what threats do we have to deal with specifically he's not attacking the rook that's defended he's only attacking the bishop but we need to be very careful about where we put this bishop because if we drop it to e2 we give the e4 pawn up and then he develops huge pressure in the center so where should we put the bishop in order to keep everything relatively nicely protected we should put it on c2 you should put it on c2 and our goal here is to castle if we can manage to castle then any shenanigans associated with white's king and being in the centers are going to be immediately ended that is going to be our immediate priority to castle now it's a little uncomfortable to be in this position with white but let's remember that we're up a piece and he has no real threats uh it's always okay so he makes a very strong bishops before stopping us from castling but the reality is black doesn't have enough pieces in the game to truly inflict any damage on our position let's bring the bishop back to e3 get this queen out of our grill it can actually come to c3 but then we're gonna pick this queen off with another piece an unexpected hero is going to make its way out of the gate what am i talking about what is white's move here to try to get this queen out of the picture yeah it's coming at me but it's fine yeah rook c1 let's bring the rook in let's try to get this queen out of here no he's playing very very well tommy's good tommy is very good let's get this queen out of here he plays a brilliant move again but let's get that queen out of here now we finally managed to get the queen out of our face but we still have the problem now of of not being able to castle and the culprit is this bishop on on c4 let's try to win this bishop can we win this bishop charlotte chesson are still here not rook b1 look at the skewer kinetic energy not rook b1 rook b1 queen a6 come on guys fine find the move bishop a4 yeah queen is overloaded we can take the rook and we win the game oh but he does have an idea and then i'll switch back to blitz okay he takes on d2 we just don't want to take with the queen because then the bishop on a4 is lost let's stick with the bishop and then maybe drop the bishop bishop back to b3 okay we're gonna see where he goes let's go bishop b3 trading the bishop then that queen's going to be stopping us from castling it's a lifelong battle but but getting the queen out of a6 is going to be very easy we can just interpose it with our own queen which will come to c4 and finally not only will be up a rook but we are finally ready to castle in fact this forces the queen trade because we are in effect forking his queen and the knight on e4 so he's got to take takes this he loses the knight and finally we are going to be able to castle and we're going to win so again i don't care about this this spot on e4 that's that's not important uh what is important is that we got rid of his bishop now we got rid of his queen and we are ready to castle on fourth queen trade good game tommy okay one second please okay yeah that was the stafford uh as you can see it even with the reputation it's uh there's there are some latent ideas there but by and large um by and large if you're very careful you should be able to to to to to ward up the threads e5 in what position e5 in which position c3 is well c3 is the refutation yeah i'm not one of several after queen b5 well the movie 5 he can actually take on e5 for example and if knight takes c4 he he we lose the queen with check so and also remember that oh i guess he wanted to go bishop f5 check and then win the bishop but maybe he can even drop it to d7 and then you don't have a discovery with a bishop so but the main reason i wouldn't play e5 is because if queen takes c5 knight takes c4 after bishop c4 is possible but this creates some discomfort because if you move your queen you allow a fork if you move it to c1 then this gets very very dangerous you take he takes on e4 he gets his rook to e8 and it's very very uh very very nasty so so i think i actually played it accurately we have to be careful in such positions but that was basically the lay of the land [Music] you
