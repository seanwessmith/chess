let us begin the speed run ladies and gentlemen let us begin the speed run and i'm going to play three minutes and two seconds increment we've got a 500 for the first game so we're gonna play e5 this is three plus two three minutes and two seconds knight f3 knight c6 everybody's familiar with this line and he plays the scotch game now the scotch is one of the oldest openings in existence the idea of the scotch is to immediately contest the center and to open up the bishop obviously we need to respond to the tension in the center the downside of the scotch is that he has moved the same piece twice in the opening why is that bad well part of the reason that it's dangerous to do so is i can develop my pieces and simultaneously attack his pieces while i'm doing that that is called developing with tempo he takes my knight now xqc charlie against xqc played queen f6 which i'm gonna do here this is charlie's move against xqc you actually do not take the knight this is called an in-between move he plays f3 to defend i'm actually gonna do five-minute games guys this is gonna be too fast now what is the downside of the move f3 what is the downside of the move f3 thank you for the 500 bits mid slam and how should i take this knight how should i take this knight now if three weakens the king obviously i actually will take it with the d-pawn because you open the diagonal for the bishop when you're considering recaptures one thing that you should always consider how can i recapture while also operating in a manner that is conducive to my development now here's the thing i'm going to develop my knight here he cannot castle that's why ben feingold says never play f3 the move f3 essentially opens up the diagonal and because i've developed my bishop to c5 he's going to have a very hard time castling why is that a bad thing and he plays bishop f4 what is the problem in this move problem with this move is he doesn't see my queen he only sees the fact that he's attacking a pawn and this will make me introduce the concept of tunnel vision he blunders his piece the concept of tunnel vision is an umbrella term that i use to describe i would say a majority of mistakes that are made by players in the beginner level let's say roughly 100 to a thousand do i want to trade queens here and this will make me talk about a very very important concept which is converting material advantages that is going to be the theme of today converting the theme of this game rather converting material advantages converting material advantage thank you sriracha for the sub now i will talk after the game and i'm writing down what i want to talk about he goes f4 now whenever a pawn is moved remember check whether any pieces or pawns have been left unprotected because by definition moving upon leaves weaknesses in its wake obviously this leaves e4 unprotected or b2 which fund is better to take queen takes b2 very good because taking the pawn on b2 when you see a good move look for a better one also attacks the rook on a1 he cannot move this rook he's going to lose this rook because if he plays queen c3 to try to x-ray defend the rook notice that the queen and the king are on the same diagonal big advice whenever the queen and the king are on the same diagonal look for pins okay that happens so often he just doesn't move the rook he doesn't move the rook at all so i'm going to take it now i'm uprooking a piece and i'm attacking the knight and guess what guys he's still not he still cannot castle that is what kills him he has to move his king out to defend the knight now here's the thing it's important now to evacuate the queen i don't want the queen to get trapped on a1 so i'm just going to move it back to e to e5 and i'm going to pin the spawn to the king i'm going to pin this bond to the king why not bishop f2 check and take the queen um i'll talk about it and he resigns okay so let's talk briefly about this game now the first mistake that he played now queen f6 should make sense to everybody i'm developing my queen and attacking the fun threatening scholarship what would have been the correct move the correct move would have been queen f3 the correct move would have been queen f3 and according to theory the move queen takes f3 this is an endgame which has occurred many many times thousands of times in top level games i will also do a little bit of trivia when we have an opening i will tell you guys when the opening was first played and who first played it so i'm going to use chess space to fill you guys in on some historical information the scotch whis first blade drum roll please the first time that the move d4 was ever played and you guys are gonna have to give me a second this this really takes a very heavy to all my computer by napoleon napoleon but apart was the first person actually according to my search who played the scotch against general bertrand napoleon was a um napoleon was actually an avid chess player that has proven but his actual games have been of disputed veracity so people think that napoleon's games may have been made up five bucks for blind spot and five bucks from shoe commander thank you so much uh according to chess historian edward winter he thinks that napoleon's games may have been made up as a kind of propaganda tool to show everybody how good he is at chess we'll talk about that later why is it called the scotch because in 1824 the city of edinburgh which is the largest city in scotland the members of the city of the chess club of edinburgh played a game with the members of the chess club of london and actually played the scotch that's why it's called the scotch and they played it several times um it was very common in the 19th century to have chess games between various cities um now after e takes d4 knight takes d4 bishop c5 knight takes c6 queen f6 the position that you see on the board in front of you the move f3 has been played 117 times um first played in 1993 but this is a big mistake the reason this is a big mistake as i explained is that it opens up the diagonal and in general i know this is a very general piece of advice but be very careful about pushing pawns in front of your king not only f3 but moves like g3 or h3 all create weaknesses around your king that needs to be treated with the highest degree of caution okay um and here i played d-take c6 which why am i doubling my pawns a lot of you might look at this and say daniel what the hell are you doing you're ruining your pawn structure but thank you the read grease for the sub thank you guys so much for the support it's important to recognize that in the opening development is more important than the pawn structure okay you guys can write this down and remember it development is more important than small deficiencies in the pawn structure like double pawns in general i think the pawn structures are largely overrated part they can incarnate another sub what incredible support guys so i could have taken with the queen and preserved the health of my pawn structure but then my bishop would not be developed and also after knight c3 let's say that i want to develop my bishop play lady6 great do you guys think this is a good move do you guys think this is a good move who can tell me why this is a good movie because i am developing my bishop but guess what following another piece of advice i shared the queen and the gang are on the same diagonal boom shakalaka this wins the queen always watch for the queen and the king on the same diagonal okay so after dc i developed my knight to e7 i would have liked to develop it to e to f6 but i can't and the final two pieces of advice i have before we transition to the next game i know that i'm spending a while on each game but that's the point of the speed run a lot of people in this position will be tempted by a particular move could somebody tell me what move seems very tempting here what move seems like it actually could be very very strong yeah good job andro fb queen h4 check checking the king now this seems tempting because if the king moves this is essentially checkmate but what can white do hey fiery white can actually block with a pawn and so it's very very important not to get overly tempted by checks particularly when you don't have your pieces developed so many times i see beginners basically looking at a check and delivering it basically because it is a check but remember the king moving away from a check is not the only way to defend against a check you can also block a check with a pawn and that is very commonly missed by beginners actually by a lot of players so that's why i developed the knight he played bishop f4 and after this things just went completely downhill for him now i think we had a question at some moment about bishop f2 check was that here were people asking about bishop f2 check here trying to distract the king from the queen well if that's the case remember the knight is also defending the queen so i can actually just take with the king and if you take my queen the knight also so count all of the defenders of a particular piece not only one of them okay aquila asks why not queen d4 is a threatened maid and the bishop at which point aquila at which point tequila here you can just take the queen here you can just take the queen so that that is no good last thing i'll share about this position how would i have played if i were white here let's say you make this mistake are you just busted you're not busted there is things that y can do silver turtle 14 and i will use this to introduce the concept of a plan now everybody has heard the word plan before plan is a sequence of steps that you want to achieve to accomplish a particular goal q42 holy smokes people need to stop this is crazy crazy amount of subs and support thank you guys now the thing with a plan is plans are hard to generate if you're a beginner because you don't have a great grasp on strategies and on pieces so it's hard to find one move much less generate a sequence of steps but i do want to show you how i think about planning and we'll obviously talk a lot more about that when i play more advanced players thank you player jaguar for the sub with twitch prime what could a plan be in this position what could a plan be in this vision and when i asked what a plan could be i'm asking about the final objective what would be the final objective of a good plan here for white what does white want to achieve and you guys do know what white wants to achieve white wants to castle so there are two possible plans one is to castle long and in order to castle longwood you need to do you need to develop the knife the bishop the queen and you can cast along that is one plan what would be the other planet fight wanted to castle short what would he need to accomplish as an intermediate step in order to castle short thank you stefan jacobs for the sub can why can't white castle uh short he would have to get rid of the bishop then i asked myself how could i get rid of the bishop well i would have to put my bishop on e3 captain call the sub why can't i put my bishop on e3 cash flow real this is unbelievable amount of subs right now thank you guys so much you can't play bishop e3 because the square is undefended okay so how do i prepare bishop e3 and i'm sure anything i can't keep up with this you would have to play queen e2 okay let's say the black castles can you now finally play bishop e3 out of court thank you for the sub this is ridiculous thank you can you finally play bishop e3 or do you need one more preparatory move no you cannot because the b2 pawn is hanging and stefan gifting us up to code sensei and wordable something is ridiculous now what would you need to do then in order to block the queen's access to b2 you would have to go either knight c3 or you would have to go c3 and then you can finally go bishop e3 and prepare to castle so i know that when you hear the word plan you might think of some mythical 15 move idea but guess what guys plans can actually be pretty simple and i claim that even a beginner can come up with a plan if you know how to think logically and you know how to essentially you know how to ask the right kinds of questions meat slim five subs to the community crumbly cheesecake teddy teddy bell jones wolfie 6925 and netsky thank you so much well ibrax asks isn't trading dark squared bishop bad for white it could be but it's very important to have a set of priorities the top priority for white is the castle i know here i don't care what's a good trade and a bad trade as long as i can castle because i would much rather not get checkmated thank you pawn m than care about good trades and bad trades so i'll talk more about priorities later after he blunders the bishop the game is basically over so takeaways from this game number one first and foremost very be very careful about pawn moves in front of your king particularly the move f3 as ben feingold reminds us number two development is more important than pawn structure especially in the opening number three in terms of planning you ask yourself questions about what you want to accomplish and then you try to understand the obstacles that stand in your way of accomplishing it obstacle number one is the bishop obstacle number two is the fact that the e3 square is not defended obstacle number three is the fact that the b2 pawn is now not under control if we play bishop b3 solving all of the obstacles leads us to a plan a plan leads us to accomplishing an objective any questions before we move on okay i'm writing all of this down so i can later maybe form a document where i contain all of these advices now let's continue with the next game i want to i do want to keep things moving smoothly so
