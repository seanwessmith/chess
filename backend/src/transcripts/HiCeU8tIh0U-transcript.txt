[Music] not to you seal we got another game with black let's begin with e4 e5 obviously the movie five okay so queen h5 this is a very very common move at the beginner level and i forgot to do a five minute game i'll make sure to do it next queen h5 attacks upon e5 you guys all probably know that it's a bad idea oh my goodness a thousand bits from anonymous your bishop c4 threatens checkmate how do we defend ladies and gentlemen against the scholars mate how do we defend against it do not play knight f6 that doesn't defend against it do not move the queen out we play g6 i will later explain why not queen e7 okay he brings his queen back to f3 and he threatens checkmate again so we're just going to develop the knight and intercept his queen's control of f7 now he cannot take my knight because the knight is defended but now i find this queen to be very annoying guys i find this queen to be very known can we chase this queen away can we chase this queen away i don't want to deal with i don't want to deal with the possibility of scholars me and guess what i'm centralizing my knife but daniel aren't you moving the same piece more than once in the opening didn't you say that you shouldn't make you know more than one move in the opening now yes but remember every rule that i share has a lot of exceptions and he has played his queen already two times so i can afford in turn to delay my development by a move and get rid of this pesky queen in an actual classical game i would have played bishop g7 but i just want to illustrate okay he's played queen e3 whenever there's a knight on d4 royal family fork boom do we take the rook no we do not we look for a better move we take the queen we take the queen we're gonna be up a queen and not only are we going to be up a queen his king is going to have to move away from castling and that's just going to be a total complete disaster okay so basically this game is already over but i'm going to talk a little bit about how to convert advantages assuming he doesn't resign assuming he doesn't resign how to convert advantages trade versus okay advantages so we take the queen now here's the important thing guys when you are up a queen and particularly when your opponent's king is out in the open like this what do you need to do you have to open up the center because only by opening up the center essentially are you going to make manifest your uh huge lead in material so how do we open the center how do we open the center yeah d5 that's it we open the center by playing t5 two defenders two attackers we can safely proceed with knight takes d5 okay he goes knight f3 now he attacks our pawn can we develop a piece and simultaneously defend the pawn can we defend it can we develop a piece and simultaneously defend the pawn yeah we can what is this called this is called fiance this is called fiance i'm going to put this in the chat fiance is an italian word that literally means to develop a bishop to the long diagonal he's got knight t3 okay so let's just take the knight and uh another very important piece of advice when you're up material you still want to develop charlie um actually had this weakness for a very long time he would win a queen and then he would forget to develop and he'd still get checkmated he's gone d4 so he does our bidding for us whenever there is a capture and i will talk more about this after the game you have to take stock of what has changed have there been any files that have opened up as a result of this trade guys and can we occupy those files with anything yes sure we can we can go rookie x-raying the king notice how not only am i up a queen but i'm opening up the center and i'm developing my pieces now to very active squares now we're just going to take the knight and this is an instructive moment do you guys see the pin do you see that because of the pin this bishop is immobile it cannot move so is there any pieces or pawns that we can take because the bishop is essentially a ghost yes sir troop commander good job sandeep we can take this one now a lot of people look at this we're blundering a bishop no we're not i i told you to count attackers and defenders this is not a defender okay it's immobile so only the rook is defending the pawn but the queen is another attacker so if the rook takes we would have taken the queen now can we take on e3 no we cannot so i have a question for you guys can we move a queen away in order to keep the bishop protected but to unpin our own bishop where can we move the queen and there's two squares yup we have six we move the queen away simultaneously defend the bishop and now we are ready to take his bishop with ours keep trading pieces and then we're going to attack that pawn with our queen that's how we're going to checkmate him okay so he's taken we can obviously take he cannot take our queen because of the pin now we're up a queen and a rook he's gone rookie one very important in such positions involve all of your pieces i'm asking myself are there any pieces that are not doing anything there's a rook let's bring that rook into the game we don't have to move our queen away now very important if he moves his king away we all when we have a piece that is untouchable due to a pin and he moves his king away from that pin that's a situation in which we have to be very careful i'm just going to sacrifice my rook for the bishop because i'm up so and i'm going to talk about that after the game um and i'm going to do five minutes from now on okay because i'm sensitive to the fact that i you know this is a little bit too frantic queen takes f3 now i'm just vacuuming up all of the spawns and this is a great time to uh the the advice i shared for you um which is that when you're up this much material you don't need to hunt this pawn you can just go straight for the checkmate and as you guys are pointing out we just bring the rook and remember if the pawn were on g7 we would not do that because rookie 8 would be checkmate okay he's gone rookie two i'm going to give him a check on d1 and i'm going to checkmate him on h1 we could have also taken the rook and the bishop and then just promoted the c pawn but this is a little bit faster earlier you had queen b2 check to sack the exchange to win the rock on b1 yeah so when you're completely winning like this and he resigns when you're completely winning like this there's multiple ways to accomplish things i'm trying to choose the method that is most most instructive okay so take everything with a grain of salt okay so one moment guys please so um bishop c4 was played by white now a lot of people in this position and hikaru famously has played queen h5 even in classical games um it's not such a bad move but obviously it's not good i will do five minute guys okay so charlie also had another weakness which is that when he would make moves he would forget that these moves would block the development of other pieces so queen e7 is inaccurate what is a block it blocks the development of the bishop blocks the development of the bishop now let's say that we did play queen e7 but we still wanted to develop this bishop can somebody tell me how we could still develop the bishop and could somebody tell me the word i have introduced which describes this particular development beautiful you guys are sharp fianchetto g6 that also simultaneously attacks the queen then we would fianchetto the bishop but another reason i don't like this move is that after knight c3 white could do something very similar to what we did which is attack our queen and centralize the knight why are we allowing this there's no need to allow it we go g6 queen f3 knight f6 obviously cannot take the knight because the queen is defending that particular square okay so he goes d3 knight t4 um so kodak says why don't we play queen f6 because doesn't that not block the development of the bishop well yeah first of all it makes the queen voluntarily second of all it blocks the natural development of the knight to f6 yeah exactly okay so he goes d3 knight t4 where should he have gone with the queen the only move would have been queen d1 and after queen d when i would have fianced my bishop and how would you proceed if you were white how can you chase this knight away from d4 is there a way to chase this knight from d4 and this is an important move to figure out c3 is correct you could also play knight f3 but after knight takes f3 again the queen would have come out and now the queen has made three moves that's a little bit on the extreme side so i would go c3 here and then just continue developing black has great development i'm fine but why so is white okay so he went queen e3 knight takes c2 knight takes e3 and now i play d5 so i hope it makes sense to everybody that when you're up let's say a queen or a rook you want to open up the center because only in that way is the full power of the queen going to be displayed now is it a bad idea here to develop your pieces absolutely not it's totally fine also to complete your development you could also prepare the move d5 how could we prepare the move d5 with a pawn okay and that would also be a very sensible concept right to play d5 so that we can recapture on d5 of the pawn and keep our center controlled by pawn but we don't need to do that that's not necessary okay knight f3 fianchettoing and simultaneously developing knight c3 now i want to talk about the concept of training and i'm going to introduce the general advice here and then i'm going to kind of keep talking about it through the lens of the following games this is an age-old problem which a lot of people are very confused by do you trade when you are up material do you trade and if so how much do you trade when do you trade now here's what i'm going to say and nobody's going to like this answer it depends you cannot say with any degree of certainty whether you trade when you're up material i would say it's 50 50. there are cases when you want to trade there are cases when you don't want to trade there are cases when you can trade or not trade and it's equally as good so let me explain i'm going to give you guys a sample position and in the sample position i'm going to explain um i'm going to explain the rationale behind both of those options and i'm going to show you guys why both can be possible and why it can be hard to decide okay i'll help you guys understand in which cases you trade in which cases you don't trade so let me set up for you guys a sample position a very simple simple position just give me a second please  with a thousand bits thank you so much appreciate it nicola okay so let me give you guys a good example here okay go and trust me this example is going to be really really simple okay really simple um it's just that i'm trying to illustrate the concept so i know people might roll their eyes at this okay whoa codex with five gifted holy stop it guys crazy support today i really appreciate it coda i'm so happy and lenser with 500 bits of course this is going on youtube i'm so happy people are enjoying this this is just the beginning um and of course i'm running out of gas here so um i'll have more energy and subsequent speed runs but i'm trying my best here and i appreciate that people are so kind generous as always okay please give me a moment guys please give me one moment here okay so this i'm so so happy that this format is is working now let me paste the position in to show you guys what i mean by it depends okay so set up position and then we're going to return to the game very briefly and continue at the end and here we go okay flip the board and it's white's plan so we have this position in front of us white is going forward and we have a decision to make what is this decision and i'm not talking mcdonald's or burger king what's the decision what's the decision i mean trade or not to trade to be or not to be to trade queens or not to trade queens now there are two ways of winning hypothetically speaking a position in which you're off a lot of material and by the way just to operationalize this thank you for those bits when i say up material for the purpose of talking beginner chess i usually mean let's say a piece up or more so like a bishop or night or more when we're talking like up a pawn none of this applies like a pawn advantage is too small to really make a lesson out of it right now i will talk about being a pawn op but maybe when we're playing slightly more advanced players we can take the queen or we cannot take it now one of the ways of winning a game of reference here and that's what everybody learns it's the trade pieces and then win the resulting position because your opponent has nothing but a king left how are you going to win this what's going to be white's plan the easiest plan of winning this position get rid of the ladies uh cut him off don't let the king this is called cutting him off and boom boom boom boom boom boom we make a new queen and um we win if we didn't have the b-pawn i will talk later about how to win such positions but the other way of winning a position where europe material is to use that material to mount an attack against the king just by definition um so let me give you guys an analogy let's say you had a soccer game in a soccer field there's 11 players right let's say somebody came up to you with an option you could remove 10 players from each side 10 players from each side and you would be left with one player leonel messi and leonesse would literally play the opposing team which had no players obviously you would take that option right lionel messi would just run up to the empty goal and he would score um but the second option would be to leave let's say all 11 players against 10 players and obviously like who would ever do that but there are situations in which the 11 players are so good that leaving them on the board is actually going to result in a faster win we can compare that to a situation in which lionel messi in order to score that goal has to fly to the stadium from elsewhere and that's going to take him a very long time whereas an attack can win the game immediately i know that's a weird analogy if we were to keep queens on the board look what you could do check and if the queen blocks what do we do actually this move also applies after king h8 what is white's best move checkmate if the king moves away the king moves away we go rook a and this is a pin against the queen do you see how quickly and how much faster white wins the game here if he keeps the queens on the board this is a simple example if we have a lot of pieces on the board sometimes it's worthwhile not to trade but rather to go directly for an attack and when you have more pieces than your opponent the attack can just crash through immediately so that is why i know the analogy goes far but now you guys won't forget it hopefully you can see why it depends okay um because in certain cases an attack decides the game a lot faster than trying to trade the other the other thing to be cautious of is that when you're trying to trade a lot of pieces it can be very easy to ignore it can be very easy to ignore um tactical threats you might be so fixated on trading pieces that you forget that there exists various threats like back rank made for example and i can show you guys plenty of examples from my games and others games where this happens by and large it depends as i play my early games i will try to let you guys in on my decision making process in terms of whether or not to trade pieces here i have an extra queen and this king is wide open so it literally makes zero sense uh to trade too many pieces so take rookie eight bishop g4 just developing now you might well daniel you just said don't trade and now you're trading this isn't really a big time trade right i'm getting rid of his knight the knight defends the pawn and i'm forcing him to either ruin his pawn structure or bring his king closer in uh where it can be checked by the queen fatal owl asks if you're bad at calculating attack should you always trade them no well here's the thing when you're a beginner you don't want to develop any complexes or big weaknesses right so if you feel like you're bad at visualizing and attacking i know that it's painful but force yourself to sometimes go for the attack because that is the only way that you get better at things you struggle with is by not avoiding them and thrusting yourself into whatever field whatever area you struggle it okay um and what often happens part of the reason beginners get stuck at a level where you feel like why can i improve is because you've spent so long avoiding a particular area of the game let's say end games or openings um that by the time you finally get around to start learning it your opponents who are rated 16 1700 just have so much more experience than you at those areas it's very very hard to eradicate those long-term weaknesses in your game so face your fears on the chess board and off the chess board okay the rest of the game was very very simple um we don't really have to look at it uh but basically i just won the pawn using the pin um queen f6 and just last thing guys when this move is played most beginners would automatically play rook b8 and here's the important pin remember guys that i said don't get way laid by meaningless material when you're up a queen like don't you play five moves just to win a pawn well the same thing goes the other way he's attacking our pawn big whoop that's just the pawn we're up a queen okay so we don't need to spend a bunch of time making our rook passive to defend this meaning was fun we can just go straight for the throat i see this all the time players getting obsessed with defending every single little pawn when they're up so much material they could easily afford to give up the fun and even more just get down to business are there any questions about this game or can i move on i'll play one or two more and then i'll pause for today are there any other questions about this game about what i just talked about and i want to take everybody's questions why not queen b2 check on wish move i don't i don't understand exactly where oh okay so queen b2 check would not have won the rook because after king f1 the king unpins itself and now you can't take the rook because the bishop takes c1 but what can black do here in order to win some material what can black do to to um orchestrate some material rook takes c3 this is called removing the defender and it comes back to something i said in the first game when there is only one piece defending a particular other piece and no pawns defending a particular other piece this is what i call a type 2 undefended piece i've developed some terminology to talk about this i will talk about it later i'm letting you guys in on some stuff that i've developed and usually share only with my students but i think they'll be totally i think they'll be okay with this when a piece is defended by only other only one other piece it's basically still undefended because you can remove its only defender and then it's essentially undefended that's what you can do here and at the end of the day you are hanging around not currently accepting any students guys i'm really really slammed as it is but i'll talk later uh about that as well okay so that was the game and final thing not getting fixated on material this is called an exchange by the way rook for a bishop or a knight is called an exchange i sacrifice an exchange and uh i just checkmated him this would be a great example of trading versus not trading i can take and trade and win a piece and win by just promoting the pawn also when by checkmating him on the spot because i have so many pieces here in the attack [Music] you
