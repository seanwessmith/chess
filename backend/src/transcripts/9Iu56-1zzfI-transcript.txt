now the point behind this move i'm opening up the bishop uh i invented this move actually e4 it's never been played before the you know the prophet arrived on the scene and rumor has it that the opponent of the creator before alexander kameko was so shocked by the genius of this move that he simply lost on time uh his internet service provider uh was just uh so shocked by this as well that they disconnected their service they were derelict in their duty okay let's go [Music] okay we are playing our first 2000 guys we have not played a 2000 and i'm going to play the c3 sittilian which i've recommended to people in this raiding range for a while thank you eric for the thousand so he goes d6 which is not the best line against because it allows us to control the center now he attacks the pawn on e4 which means that we need to defend it by deploying our bishop and there's a couple of subtleties to be aware of here particularly if he goes knight c6 yeah so we we develop our knight to defend d4 now bishop g4 here looks very intimidating i'll explain it after the game he goes e6 which is very very passive a very passive development by our opponent there's nothing special that we need to do to play against that but um one well there's there's basically two ways of playing here we can open up the center with dc which would make a lot of sense or we can play sort of flexibly we can play bishop g5 now let's do it by the book let's just develop all of our pieces knight b to d2 that is the downside of the allopin you can't get the knight to c3 but that's okay i mean the knight is fine here and it also buttresses the pawn on e4 so we're definitely better we've got a nice pawn center he's probably going to go d5 and try to lock up the center but he's going to be left with a lot of positional weaknesses and and he's going to be very cramped so a successful it goes e5 now a lot of people struggle with this scenario right how do we make a decision between d e d5 and and you need to use kind of your intuition here right d e would open up the position to his favor it would allow him to go d e and attack our bishop so we go d5 we keep the center closed and our space advantage here should in theory um you know it it should cost him now there's actually a tactical detail here that i failed to anticipate let's see if he finds it let's see if yeah he does knight d5 so i actually missed this move uh but that's okay and this is the good thing about being positionally better you can blunder upon and you can still be fine because he's opened up the d file how can we put pressure on the pawn on d6 what can we do to put pressure on this pawn we can go knight to c4 no disaster has happened we've still got a good position uh but this is a very instructive mistake that i just made they're blundering that move uh and i've even we've even had this before on the other side okay so we win back the pawn with with our knight and the position is about equal and i'll show you guys after the game how i could have done better than this uh if he pushes with d5 we would have taken and then the e5 pawn would have been hanging okay so let's see what he does we're also attacking by the way the e5 pawn he's got a nice knight on b4 though to counterbalance that the best move here would definitely be queen to b6 preparing to sizzle down that knight with rookie to die in that case we need to evacuate this knight it goes queen to c7 not i believe not the most accurate move what does this allow us to do why is this queen on c7 not ideally placed well there's several things we could do we could go knight to b5 with tempo and actually most people here would go for rook c1 but here's the thing guys the knight on d6 is the vulnerable piece here so instead of using this get out of jail free card to activate our rook which we could do later let's go knight to b5 let's evacuate our knight because that's priority number one chess is all about priorities what is the top priority it's actually to get the night out guess what we can do now something we couldn't have done earlier if this night was in trouble now it's not in trouble it's defended and i think he's forgotten what has he forgotten about he's forgotten that the pawn is hanging and now we're over up upon uh so yeah so sometimes chess is about resisting the temptation right to do something by the book and to prioritize if he takes on a2 he's going to lose material and i'll show that after the game okay he goes a6 so he chases 2-2 think he chases them sure no problem we'll get the knight back to c3 and even safer square he's probably gonna yeah rook d8 now we got to be careful right if we go queen to e1 we walk into a fork so where can we put our queen such that it remains hey ruin thank you where should we put our queen such that it remains active we should go to a4 we apply pressure on the knights okay queen c1 would have also been possible this is just a little bit more active okay so let's see what he ends up doing um he goes queen to c5 all right he's attacking this knight he's not actually attacking it though uh because the b4 knight would hang uh we need to make a move here that would help the smoke clear a little bit and we we need to use the opportunity of the fact that the knight on e5 is not really hanging that knight on b4 is what's causing a lot of problems for us snyder before is like you guys can see that it's cramping me down a little bit so can we just forcibly get it out of there how can we forcibly get this b4 knight out yeah let's go e3 i'm not really attacking the knight so much as i'm compelling him to go for this trade remember that we're up a pawn so trades in general are good for us what's also good for us is that he no longer has his strongest piece now he's sort of forked he's got to probably drop his queen back and uh he's losing the compensation that he had for the pawn although we still have a couple problems to solve and he drops the knight actually he blunders the knight uh because you know he kind of just panicked there so very complicated 20 moves here that you know sometimes things end like this now here we have a we have a nice little trick i'm going to make the first move and if he takes on b2 i want you guys to tell me the second move we can win immediately with a very very typical tactical idea noticing that the queen is making contact with the rook which means that we can get our own rook to d8 and he simply cannot defend this rook he has to go for the backrank checkmate or he has to give up the rook neither of which is appetizing and so we've beaten her first two thousand yeah he was good uh this guy put up a big resistance particularly since i made a tactical error but uh okay so he's gonna continue playing um let's take with the rook and we can continue you know harvesting the garden here where the rook takes f7 because he cannot take the queen is pinned if he takes the knight we take his bishop and that's another trade and that's beneficial for us now he's seen that he takes on e2 but i've calculated one step further can you guys find the mate in two moves bingo as rosev sees it who else sees it queen to f5 he can't cover because the penny's got to drop his king back and we're gonna fade his checkmate okay so a good game a sloppy one but nonetheless okay so let's see what he what he ends up doing okay he's disconnected i think he's not very happy he thought he had me but you know you can't give up gotta keep keep pounding keep grinding okay so just quickly sorry about this game this game so he played d6 right which gives us control of the center this is a line i've even played with black now if he goes bishop g4 we go d5 and 95 here may look very good but white has a very very nice idea in this position and a typical one right when this diagonal is open what becomes possible knight takes e5 bingo we're not blundering the queen we're setting this up and when the smoke clears we're up a piece this happens in so many different openings it happens in the queen's gambit some of you guys might be familiar with the famous queen's gambit version where you play knight bd7 you seem to blunder the pawn but the reality is you have bishop before winning his queen back then you capture the bishop and you're up a piece same exact concept so that's why we allowed ourselves that now my mistake i think one of my key mistakes was actually the funny thing is i don't think i should have developed the bishop to g5 because it ended up being a big liability i actually think i should have probably just taken got queen e2 and then put a rook on d1 to x-ray his queen potentially even gone e5 to cement my central control we've seen time and time again this bishop on g5 when it faces off with the bishop on e7 it gets into trouble precisely for the reason that my opponent displayed which is knight takes d5 and this very same knight defends the bishop if we take the knight he takes the bishop and that bishop is protected i've even done this once in a classical game against an im who blundered this um couldn't we have just yeah we could have taken on f6 we should have uh but this basically relinquishes whatever you know whatever idea of an advantage i had because it gives black the two bishops he can then redeploy his bishop and prepare f5 so black has a good position here um i showed that game not so long ago yes because i had this in a speedrun game but i decided to test them it's very important to sort of reorient right when you've blundered something you blunt it upon you've learned a piece even you rethink your priorities you're no longer better now your goal is to fight back step by step and reassess the situation so even though we've blundered upon we have to see the silver lining which is that the d file has been opened and with that the d6 pawn which is a weakness is easier to attack um and and if he goes d5 then we take d5 he takes back and we take e5 restoring material equality now if he had taken on a2 here what we would have done is knight to d7 forking the queen and the rook you guys might be looking no problem he just takes what what the what's the big deal but remember he's got a knight on e2 now that knight is hanging as is the other night it's a funny situation he can't save both knights at the same time uh so whenever you have a situation like this where a piece defends another piece that's why i call this a type 2 undefended piece and i draw attention to it because it's a very dangerous situation which can basically ask for a piece uh sorry there's a dingley wren playing grisham ask for a piece to be overloaded uh sorry here we go and so he goes a6 we drop our knight back we deploy our queen and then the key moment here of course he blunders the knight he should have gone queen to c7 but now we can bring a rook into x-ray his queen and we've got uh we're basically in very good shape here what if you went bishop d7 in response to a3 um well remember that the square is covered right the square is covered by the knight and the queen so that would not have been very advisable i did calculate the a2 thing i i mean briefly uh so we go a3 just to clear up the smoke get rid of his his strongest piece and and that's an underestimated way of thinking what is my opponent's strongest piece how can i get rid of it right a3 gets rid of it and immediately things clarify we're in good shape uh yeah knight c6 i mean he's he's okay but he's down a pawn and you know he doesn't have much compensation for it anymore because our pieces are now nicely coordinated my world ring is about 130 140 something like that let's go e4 and he plays the karakon thanks 180. so i don't think we faced the karaoke before and to illustrate okay never mind he doesn't play the icon he plays d6 there's a funny story about this move that i'll share after the game as we already know uh when our opponents play stuff like this we don't need to modify our strategy we simply continue our development and now there's two fundamental ways of playing we can go f4 and occupy more of the center or we can just continue our development with knight f3 either option is good um let's go f4 let's play it like the romantics would have now we have to be careful as i've explained yesterday the more center we occupy the more pieces we need to bring in to supervise that center we don't just want to keep mindlessly expanding and expanding because you know our empire is going to collapse okay so he goes z5 striking in the center there's no need to respond to this because both of our pawns are protected uh so we can simply continue our development where should we go how should we continue our development which piece should we develop where should we develop it who can tell me i'll explain later why why i get away with this yeah absolutely bishop c4 uh good job and uh we're immediately creating a line of fire to the pawn and f now he's got to be very careful my opponent is developing very passively which means that okay he stops oh we're gonna castle look at this f-file okay this is gonna get very hairy for him but we gotta play this well so there's a couple of things that we could do here again there's multiple ways of playing a position like this but there's no immediate win and uh he's actually doing this quite decently in the sense of avoiding an immediate win we can open the f file but he's put a knight on f6 to block that file so i wouldn't rush to play f65 what i would do is ask myself okay um i we can go f takes e5 we actually have a really really cool move let me think about this for a second this is actually a very interesting moment um hmm i'm actually doing some calculation of my own okay let's open up the file let's open up the f file and one thing that we can do after he plays d takes e5 i assume he's going to play dtake c5 we can take and go bishop f4 but we got to be very careful about not giving him a big time outpost right so what we're actually going to do is d5 and after the game i'll explain this move in greater depth but now look at his queen and his knight they're just biting on granite they're just staring at this pawn now we've basically left it in the dust if that makes sense and the f-file is still open so we still have that going for us okay draconis thank you for the prime now we basically just need to find a way to develop the rest of our pieces the bishop is not developed um and well first let's take on c6 let's open up the diagonal for the bishop before we decide on anything else now bishop e3 would have been a good move were it not for knight g4 but if you notice what's wrong with knight g4 we're going to play bishop e3 anyway hoping for knight g4 because then we have a big tactic i'll show that after the game now he is threatening knight g4 we need to stop that because that's going to dislodge the bishop and then he could put his queen on b6 how should we prevent knight g4 not a difficult question not a trick question how should we stop knight g4 don't be shy about making a move like h3 alright sometimes you gotta you know even uh kings have to pee or whatever i don't know even you know you don't have to uh scale everest with every move you make something just stop something like naichi for that's totally fine now he sets up an x-ray against the queen let's get this queen out of there now where why did i put the queen on e1 you guys are familiar with uh this maneuver where is the queen going now we are going to scale everest where is the queen going is it going to h4 no it's not we're going queen g3 because we are setting up an x-ray against the king what are we threatening we're threatening bishop takes h6 we are hoping for knight g6 that would blunder a knight remember that bishop on c4 didn't go anywhere it's still there and by playing h6 he's weak in the g6 square the pawn on f7 is paralyzed it cannot move so knight g6 would blunder the knight he's in trouble because not only are we threatening bishop takes h6 we're also attacking the e5 pawn and it's very important to get a full sense of what you're threatening don't zero in immediately on one thing look at everything that you're threatening okay so we can play bishop takes h6 but then he has a very tricky response in knight h5 which is actually quite annoying and i will flesh this out in greater detail after the game one thing that we can well let's take on e6 and um now if the bishop takes h6 again he plays knight h5 and things get a little bit messy but h6 is not the only pawn that's hanging what other pawn is hanging can somebody tell me and what should we take it with e5 now we should take it with the queen and after the game i'll explain and i'm writing all this down i won't forget any of this why didn't we take it with the knight there's a very specific tactical reason for that um and and so we take it with the queen now bishop d6 almost traps our queen but it doesn't because we have the f5 square by the way the reason we didn't take with a knight is because he would have had bishop d6 now we have queen f5 and i believe that we are home free we also are threatening the move e5 the f file didn't go anywhere that's still up for grabs yeah the knight would be pinned there's some cool tactics here uh and and i'll talk a little bit more about that after the game we're a little bit low on time so let's expedite the process here no need not to play e5 let's expand let's get the bishop out of the picture and then we can contest the defile if we want to by playing rook a to d1 uh let's see where he goes everything depends on where he goes with the bishop okay so bishop c5 no need not to trade we're up upon we're not against trades and now we're going to bring the rook into the game contesting the open d file hopefully this makes sense the knight on h7 is also very passive so in this part of the game we're just going to bring the rest of our pieces in and then we're going to see depending on what he does we're just going to keep improving every one of our pieces now i see this square on d6 what piece could land on that square with great effect can somebody tell me what piece is just it's vying for that square absolutely get that knight over there damn girl and then well then f7 is going to be under pressure some of you might say wait a second doesn't he win the pawn on b2 do i care i absolutely do not care let him take it okay so he takes this way he's probably gonna go rook d8 no all right well i guess i'll have to prove myself so let's move the king and if he takes it we are going to descend upon him like there's no tomorrow now knight d6 would be tempting but let's not rush before playing knight d6 we can slide the rook into d7 uh so that knight d6 comes with more tabasco sauce so to speak right when you see a tempting move you don't want to rush to play it you want to make sure that you played in the best possible version we're not winning here it's not that simple uh but we are attacking f7 and he his position is on the cusp of collapsing he's actually playing extremely well uh this guy is putting up a very good resistance but you can see that he's beginning to show cracks okay so we're going to take this knight and now it's a simple task of basically if we can move one of the defenders away from the f7 pawn we'll be able to take it what should we do after he takes what should we do how yeah of course we should play h4 we can't remove the rook but we can remove the knight knight has to move then we take f7 and his position collapses completely because we're just going to have a devastating attack against this king and we should start thinking about what we want to take on f7 he's probably considering a move like g6 uh which which would prolong yep so that's a good move but we're going to slide the screen right over here to f6 and again he's finding only moves here to survive knight h7 here would attack my queen and force me to attend to that threat but it wouldn't solve the long-term problem that he's facing which is that f7 pawn it's still hanging and guess what he might stave this off for a couple moves thank you jacob c for the but you know he's making these one-move threats but what he's not doing is is solving the underlying problem here of this pawn but he is playing extremely well once again i have to give him a lot of credit here okay so queen here let me think oh we have a sick tactic i think this works so we can play knight takes f7 in the interest of time i'm gonna play this move now but can somebody tell me the follow-up what is the follow-up i'm removing the defender here on what square i'm removing the defender on which square which square can i now access with my queen the g6 square now he's got two choices he can move to h8 but then he drops the rook or he can move to f8 and then i'd like somebody to tell me the checkmate it's made in two take it away guys i'm gonna sit back don't worry everything's under control and do the honors please bingo good game and definitely a lot to talk about let's delve in so he played this and there's a funny story about an old russian master named vladimir simagen uh who was a grandmaster from the the early 19th century early 19th century i don't none of those things were true i think he lived in first half of the 20th century lord of the bings thank you for the prime and uh their story goes that he had a long night on the town and then he comes to the game the next day and semagon plays c6 and then he plays d6 and and he was a karo khan player so his friends after the game are like a lot of me are like what are you doing he's like well i didn't have the strength to push the pawn to d5 i don't know in russian this sounds funny anyways he didn't have the strength to play the karo khan instead he played one of these openings where you prepare the movie five quite passive and why is f4 something i can get away with doesn't this actually weaken my king it does and i talked about this yesterday part of playing chess at this level and above is is all about making these cost-benefit analyses right i'm making this story up no it actually exists in russian i think uh but it is funnier in russian so it's a cost-benefit analysis so on the one hand we're occupying more of the center on the other hand we're weakening our king so the question i ask myself is can i foresee a scenario where he exploits my weakened king the answer to that really is no because look how passively he's already developing i'm using that as a clue to justify a slightly more ambitious way of developing it's all about what your opponent is doing okay so we develop develop h6 is a good move stopping knight g5 we castle uh we open up the file and now the move d5 basically leaving his queen and knight in the dust if he would have taken on deep oh ho and the hype continues thank you chester july david costa awesome channel and great instructional content you should check them out thank you for the rate of the party of 114. my lands we are having an epic first hour of my stream welcome guys i'm doing the speedrun talking about my first game here welcome everybody thank you knit svj for the prime okay so appreciate it david now what would i have taken with here what would i have taken with here and this is to the point that chess is a trade-off chess is a complete game of trading one advantage for another the bishop of course we don't want to take with the knight we blunder the bishop every time a trade happens in the center remember the rule every time a pawn is captured in the center you want to re-evaluate and see which pieces are hanging taco is hanging with ten gifted subs holy smokes it ain't stopping thank you jim jim so we would have taken to the bishop now i hear some of you guys saying wait a second isn't the bishop my strongest piece yes it is but guess what it's been replaced by an even stronger piece the outpost on d5 you see what i'm saying okay so there should be some blah blah blah bishop e3 now had he played knight g4 to chase my bishop what cool tactic would white now have who can spot it thank you gem jam absolute absolute legend absolute legend yeah bishop f7 is correct using the f file driving the king and now a double check which is a check from two different sources the reason double checks are good is because the king is forced to move by literally by definition and now we recapture the knight we're up two pawns and the king uh has been totally decimated uh okay so knight g4 would not have worked h3 now knight g4 would have been a threat and by the way that's something that people forget to do all the time when a move fails for a tactical reason you got to be very careful about not assuming that that reason is going to remain throughout the game that's one of the most common sources of blunders i see at all levels is a player makes a move uh for example it might be a move where you know let me give a very very simple example uh and if you guys just give me a second proper gifting to just dodge i'm gonna pull up my chest space so that i have it for instructional purposes not to make a huge point out of this but i think this is incredibly important for people's development so let's say that you decide to do the following just give me a second please i'm setting up the chest-based scene this will take me about 30 more seconds and then we'll delve into the meat okay we're almost there just make this a little bit bigger okay okay i think we're good this will be fine uh so let's take a a position like this right it's white to play thank you dbo 9000 for the sub what should white do in this position joe andrist 123 keeps the hype going i know this is unbelievable we take the pawn of course now let's say that black plays the move h6 here a very good example of and i call this i don't actually have a name for this but failure to kind of pay attention to detail ah you know i got okay i can play g4 that's fine he can't take the bishop oh my god i so that's obviously a very dumbed down example nobody's actually going to do that but you see what i mean it's very easy to forget that the situation has changed in a certain way which makes it a tactical justification no longer valid carelessness i there's many names for it but you see the point all right so that's why we played h3 now we get the queen to g3 and now the tactics begin so by the way knight g6 we would have taken the knight he can't take because of bishop takes g8 so okay the point that i wanted to make is that there is a certain level 17 1800 in which at some point things just boil down to calculation not not everything can be explained by logic alone sometimes you just have to sit down and calculate and the fact that the tactics work out in one player's favor isn't necessarily itself the product of some sort of higher being that's organizing things chess has a lot of coincidence and chance in it and things that don't always make logical sense so bishop takes h6 would look very good intending to checkmate but it would allow knight h5 right attacking the queen and simultaneously defending g7 the queen cannot remain on the g file which means that not only do you give up this bishop but the other bishop is saying but if you would have first taken on e6 as i did and now taken on h6 this is a very tough situation again because we can't move the queen away from the g file and if we move it up to g4 what is black going to do can somebody tell me what black is going to do here and this puts me in a bind from which i literally cannot get out notice that both knights are defending g7 so we can assign a different task to one of the knights this is going to be a three-time repetition because to avoid the draw i have to give up a piece i can try to sacrifice it but that's very iffy does that make sense so that's why bishop takes h6 was bad queen takes c5 instead was my choice the reason i didn't take with a knight because of bishop d6 pinning the knight to the quake to the uh to the queen i know some of you guys are saying whoa whoa i can take this knight now but he plays bishop takes c5 forking the queen of the rook lots of tactics here a little plucking another raid 37 welcome people thank you uh thank you mark for the raid so does that make sense and that's why we take queen takes c5 e5 takes rook d1 contesting the file getting the knight to an outpost getting the rook in first and now up to the last tactic so here i could have played c4 to intercept the queen from f7 right somebody well nick mullins would have played this move in a second uh i mean interception tactics no problem but i played a better move here knight takes f7 is the tactical solution and and this is a form of removing the defender the reason that i do this is because i want to give the check on g6 but obviously i well i can but that wouldn't be very advisable so by removing the defender we slide the queen in his king has to maintain contact with the rook if he moves the side i go rook takes f7 but king f8 leads to this checkmating pattern which is actually quite common right if you solve a lot of problems that's why problem puzzle solving is so important it it awakens your mind to these kinds of patterns without it you won't find something like this it or or it'll take you a lot longer uh well i played king h2 because i was in check so no big big reason i i kind of chose king h2 king h1 at random uh i think both moves would have been fine i didn't play king h1 the reason is i was a little bit worried about a background check potentially so king h2 i thought was marginally safer but you can never predict you know sometimes one is safer sometimes the other is safer any questions ladies and gentlemen and please i always say this and i always mean it do not be shy about asking questions that's the entire premise the speed run right is for everybody to sort of fully understand everything as much as possible and if you ask a question that's actually a very selfless thing to do because most likely everybody else has that question in their mind anyway um what if he took with a king okay so what if he had just responded to d5 asks drum uh with c5 well that's a great question but look at this pawn that would have been created as a consequence we can go knight b5 and then shove this pawn through to d6 and get the knight to c7 so this would have allowed me to create this massive pass pawn which i would have pushed pushed even further um what's the meaning of life what is my social security number great questions there i have played d4 actually will the niners make the plays well not after yesterday um yeah so i would advise people to play rapid 15-minute chess when you're first starting and then slowly if you like blitz you can transition to it but definitely wrap it to start what if black had played knight h5 straight after queen g3 yeah so i would have taken the pawn here and and that's why i mentioned it's important to be aware of everything that you're attacking with a particular move uh and now f7 would have fault as well would have fallen as well [Music]
