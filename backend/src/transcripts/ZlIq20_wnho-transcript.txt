[Music] okay let's move on and i'll talk about improving calculation as well later another perk we've had the perk okay c6 so this is um this isn't it is a line uh but we don't have to do anything particularly different from what we normally do okay i'm tempted to play knight d5 because this guy's gonna probably pre-move like b6 or something but what should we do how should we how should we continue our development in the simple way so we have several approaches here we can we can choose to to occupy more of the center with f4 that would be possible but let's let's play the comm move with knight f3 and now let's of course develop this bishop to c4 and we're going to dismantle this the hell out of this line okay now bishop g4 pins our knight uh and by pinning our knight he's exerting indirect pressure on the d4 pawn so where should we put this bishop with an eye toward that well bishop f7 doesn't work because of queen f7 he thinks he's cool but we're going to show him that he's not this should be threes right this is why you shouldn't be afraid of these kinds of players who like do all this stuff really fast now here's an interesting question well which side do we castle we can actually castle queen side that would be risky but before we decide which side to castle on i am annoyed as hell about this pit in theoretically how can we dispose of this pin without moving the bishop to a passive square h3g4 now what would h3g4 mean uh in terms of where we castle like if you think about it if we played h3g4 where do we basically commit to castling we basically commit to castlement but that's okay because he's developed so poorly that it's okay for us to telegraph the past okay he's not going to checkmate us he doesn't have anything out his pieces are passive he's full of weaknesses let's get rid of the pen and since we've decided to castle queenside well let's fricken castle queenside queen e2 castle and uh then we're going to start attacking on the king side even though he's not castled no that doesn't matter that doesn't mean we can't attack on the king's side we need to queen d2 eeny meeny miny moe i'll go queen e2 so that the rook has is the star of the show on the default now do we need to defend um this square um i would say no probably not let me think actually yeah no we can just castle and if he takes we'll i'll i'll show why i think that's the case well we can try to trap the bishop but he's probably not gonna allow it okay so here's the thing the thing is we are ahead in development the immediate association that you should make is to opening up the center so first step is to open up the center a little bit more so that we can better exploit our lead in developments okay interesting position and i have a very interesting question what should we capture here and this is not an obvious answer at all there's actually three things that are entirely plausible to capture here and all three have a compelling case to be made for them we can actually take f7 and lure the king onto f7 sacrificing our bishop and try to checkmate him shall we do that we can actually also play e takes d7 yeah let's do it daniel style let's go let's punish him for this let's let's get our hands dirty here because his whole queen side is undeveloped now this is risky because it's a whole piece and if you consolidate now where should we go from now the obvious move is e takes d6 opening up more of the center but there is also another move that is more concrete in its intentions but also potentially more powerful in its conclusion which is e6 to prepare queen f7 checkmate uh i don't know which move is better but we'll see okay bishop f6 that's a good move um and now we we need to somehow find a way to start breaking down his defenses and at the core of his defenses is this pawn on d6 now g5 is very tempting i know you guys are tempted by that but he just goes bishop e5 and that actually doesn't accomplish as much as it seems because the queen defends f7 so we are going to play the move bishop f4 this is the kind of move which a lot of people at the 1600 level struggle with at any level because it doesn't look it doesn't carry that kind of pizzazz which you associate with the attacks but remember attacks have to have those what i call glue moves ah ladies and gentlemen we've opened up the d-file what does that mean this would be checkmate were it not for the queen which we can distract with rook d8 and give the checkmate and what move contributed to that that's the glue move bishop f4 okay prepare slowly attack fast good game so all right um so he went here and so just to dispel yeah let's dispel the fiction that he doesn't know what he's doing so let's dispel with one um illusion which is that it's not about how much of the central center you control it's about the quality of the pawns in the center by which i mean uh you can put you know a million pawns in the center and you'll lose half of them congratulations you're controlling the center okay but it's more important to to occupy a little bit of the center but make sure that that little bit is supported by the pieces okay so knight c3 queen c7 we got to put it all in the lockbox knight f3 uh e5 just this is all very natural development and now g4 bishop g6 queen e2 preparing to castle long castles long sacrificing the pawn um and could you have captured bishop f7 one move sooner than checked in with his knight and recount oh so just to clarify this is a very typical tactic when the bishop is undefended uh and the idea is you draw the king out and go knight g5 and queen takes g4 which is all well and good but you have to factor in the queen so full board vision queen takes f7 that doesn't work uh but if the queen was not on f7 by the way if the queen was on d8 this would also not work why if the queen was on d8 this would also not work why is that and that is something people very often miss or forget about and you can actually catch some people on this trap let's let's actually imagine the queen of san diego so the queen could just take the knight that's actually crucial boom the queen simultaneously defends the bishop and if you count up the pieces black is just up a piece here which is uh which is bad so that's that's something to bear in mind as well uh so anyways uh fast forward to the moment of truth the obvious move here was yeah we need to i thought the queen might come to f3 one day the obvious move is queen f3 but but the reason i didn't do this is because of d5 he he closes in the bishop uh and then he has a he has a tempo which you can use to at least castle which does not make the king particularly safe but it makes it a little bit harder to reach uh but the capture that some people might be forgetting about is e takes d6 you might be looking at this whoa what is this i mean you're allowing black to take the queen but but look one step further you take uh black's queen and this pawn it's not so much that it threatens to take the knight although that too is a big threat you actually threatened to promote black has to prevent this by moving his knight away but now you come back and take the bishop and if you count the material you are up upon which you can then defend with bishop f4 so it's not easy for black to win this fun white is winning in the end game so if i was playing a classical game i would probably go for this but we decided on the sort of enterprising move no bishop f7 is the top computer move so it's hilarious all three moves lead to a clear advantage i checked but here um i think e6 is actually not the best i think we should have gone here and and maybe uh queen f5 queen e6 just the sort of more dinosaur approach open everything up and and get your pieces to get squares but we played e6 and now we play the glue move bishop f4 and how does this move function it functions because you want to eliminate the d6 spot why is it important to eliminate 56 spawn because not because it's a free pawn but because that is the key to black's kingdom if you can open up the d-file that's a crucial artery to black's king and if you think about it we already have one artery or one avenue but that's uh defended by the queen if there's going to be two avenues and we saw this happen exactly in the game that's like screaming an overloading tactic so to find overloading tactics you need to identify situations where there's two potential mating squares both of which are defended by one piece and so you can overwhelm that piece by sacrificing one piece on one mating square and then that vacates the other one so rook d7 also would be possible by the way yeah but rook d7 queen d7 would keep black in the game for the time being knight takes c7 and black is still breathing although queen b3 basically kills him because of this so of course this would be winning but rook d8 is much much cleaner so hopefully this uh this makes sense to everybody okay um so that was a nice game and we we dismantled this uh unsuccessful attempt at an intimidating opening setup no knight takes doesn't work of course because that's the whole point of rook d7 right because that that blocks the queen's control of f7 yeah that's that's the sort of purpose of rook d7 interception tactic or interference i think it's called okay let's continue one more and then we'll probably call it because i have a lesson soon all right but after such hype i i have to i have to continue okay so again we're gonna go for a sicilian and again it goes f4 so i guess it's a popular line okay so we literally just had this but i don't think it's the same guy okay so this guy plays bishop e2 uh the the previous guy played c3 so we don't actually need to play t4 here we can we can develop and here we can well we don't have the d5 square but we do have the g okay knight h4 um that's interesting and that throws a bit of a wrinkle in our in our plan because if we go knight g6 we allow him to take our bishop and that kind of ruins our our structure on in the center so what we should do is we should we should flip the the order of our pieces we should go bishop g6 and then vacate that square for the knight now again we can go d4 but this time let's actually play it without d4 let's go knight f5 why is it okay if he takes our bishop we would have taken with the h pawn and opened up that file toward his king okay d4 would be a mistake okay so he tries to trade all of our pieces which is kind of an annoying strategy but um it would be fine to trade here but what else could we do here what what else could we do here yeah g4 was a thing but i'll explain how we would have dealt with that yeah bishop d3 is a nice move let's see what he does yeah and now we can go back to g6 so the whole purpose of that if we went to g6 immediately he would have been able to go f5 and sort of broken up the center now the bishop is safe and sound and we can just go bishop e7 okay he's going back to g4 but now f5 is no longer dangerous because we've already castled and made our king safe so that f5 would just blunder up yeah i mean what exactly do we do here what do we do here he's annoying but he was too persistent like he uh he was too stubborn in in in trying to accomplish his plan he doesn't again everything comes back to not developing well enough right that's the root of all problems the root of all evil now what should we take back with another very instructive moment and again i'm going to give you guys a hint we can violate a rule here and it would be justified so the instinct that everybody has i know is to take with a knight to preserve the pawns or to take with the h fund but is anybody thinking about maybe taking with the f one so that we can open up a file why is it important to open up a file here because he's not developed so an open file is a ticking time bomb for him plus it's hard for him to develop because he can't go knight d2 because of knight takes d3 that was good timing um it's gonna go in the youtube video and um okay so knight f3 now the immediate instinct is to move the knight away but there's really nowhere to move it but that's that's okay we've anticipated that what can we do here who wants to yeah c4 bingo what move do we prepare by playing c4 in addition to supporting the knight which we play now absolutely and it's all pouring in smothered made ideas rook to e8 of bishop e3 the game is okay t4 let's get this rukovich in and this is going to be devastating he has to play bishop e3 now [Music] simple he never developed his bishop and by extension he never developed the rook so of course and guess which file guess which file we delivered the checkmate on the f file which we opened by playing fdx g6 so you can see very directly the benefit of opening up a file when your opponent lacks development now you have to be careful about that because you also want to make sure that you're accounting for the price that you pay for this right if he manages to consolidate then yes we've weakened our pawn structure and we sort of disattached one pawn island from the other pawn island which is definitely a price of admission but i judged that it was worth it because i knew that he had a very hard time developing his pieces here now what should white have done here how should he have gone about trying to develop his queen side there's a very specific move that he didn't play here which he should have played and it was really the only chance for him to quickly develop his queen side okay not sure what c4 does i mean you could just take well d4 d4 targets the symptoms but not the disease although you're right yeah you could try this but bishop f4 is what i meant i actually meant a simpler move bishop f4 developing with tempo and then you could move the knight out to d2 now still we could take a page out of his book and try to trade the bishops and then get a queen here so uh i still think black is doing great here but that that that was what he should have done uh and the funny thing is so okay the opening was very clear knight g6 here would be bad because yeah so we go bishop g6 and that's a very common idea in the karokan sort of you know switch i don't know what to call this like the flippage of pieces from f5 to g6 and then the other the other piece occupies the square recently vacated it's a good chance to come up with some sort of a name uh can we go knight d4 yeah 94 is possible we can centralize the night absolutely um and and we can go after this bishop too uh so that would be a great move actually the switcheroo now some people asked about g4 and yes g4 would be annoying particularly since bishop g6 would run into f5 but this is where i always say do not stop calculating when it seems like the line is over take and i call this the 15 second rule i've never introduced this before now i'll put it this way my students are very divided on whether this is bs or the most helpful thing in the world so some of my students have said like look i've given this a chance i think you're full of it this doesn't actually help um but some have said this is like really really helped me i call this the 15 second rule so when you're calculating a variation and you're about to stop calculating uh you take an additional 15 seconds just to make sure that you didn't miss any additional resources okay that's as simple as that now you don't need to do that in every line that you calculate but only in like the important lines what do i mean by important lines i mean look if bishop g6 worked then our position would be really really good so we really want this to work so if you're really trying to make a move work and you find that it doesn't work force yourself to stare at the final position in which you abandon the line because maybe you allow your brain to gather some more data about the position and find a resource boom boom boom attacking the king attacking the pawn white can block with bishop g4 and you can go bishop h5 pinning the bishop and white's position collapses so hopefully that makes sense anyways i'll talk more about that later so here here here now if he had gone d4 um how would we have gone about attacking this pawn and this is a very typical queen b6 and this shows you the danger of having see this is where you see that it's not about how many pawns you have in the center but the quality of the pawns in the center because white can't contain his center bishop e3 blunders the pawn of b2 so he loses the pawn on d4 it's a classic uh classic trope so he went f5 which was asking for trouble f takes g6 knight e3 and look at all of our pieces come in one after the other bishop knight queen knight bishop rook rook checkmate down the f5 bingo questions all right good very very good um this was a this was a nice game um and let's play one last one encore encore i'm feeling good chess man we're having a lot of black games today uh but okay we'll play another sicilian okay queen f3 great he's probably gonna go here nope okay so again there is no need to change our strategy because our opponent is playing something dumb so we can just develop our pieces okay and there's two fundamental approaches that we can take here one is to panda with a thousand bits thank you one is to open up the center immediately with d5 but i don't recommend that because that could potentially justify the placement of the queen uh so let's actually prepare well we can prepare d5 let's prepare d5 let's go e6 and d5 just so that we get a nicer more robust pawn center also it's very important to realize that we're not going to beat this in in two moves okay we need to play methodically we need to develop our pieces and we can't play our opponents game here okay we should we should play okay so this move almost loses one second yeah it's very close because 95 almost drops the queen but he has queen e3 uh he has queen e3 and that square is is relatively safe so there's no need for that yet let's castle let's castle let's see what he does oh ladies and gentlemen why is this a bad move horrible this is a this move will kill him immediately i mean in the next like five moves and he can't even get his nut he's probably going to go knowing the type of guy that this guy is bishop d1 he's probably going to go bishop d1 thinking that he's going to develop the knight c2 but we're going to show him who's boss here watch him go bishop d1 that would actually be kind of sick but no i actually can't predict can't predict these people's moves i mean he can literally do anything under god's blue sky yeah g4 okay um now rookie a now obviously if he goes g5 which he probably will um yeah there was no way i could predict that then we obviously okay queen g2 fiance is queen great now he wants to go knight f3 which is a noble intention we have so many good moves here i literally we could fill up a book with the amount of good moves that we have we could go 95 and the simplest is to go knight i would have gone queen e7 to stop him from going knight f3 by the way but this is also good because if he goes knight f3 obviously we have checks on d3 and out of four with a huge fork so he moves his king great bond cloud on top of everything else but this is the moment where a lot of people struggle we need to strike while the iron is hot we have most of our pieces developed so we need to open things up before he gets a chance to consolidate how should we go about doing that there's two tempting moves one of them is a mistake the other is good so there's d4 and c4 d4 is a mistake because it allows him to go c4 and it closes up the center now why is it not symmetrical what if he goes d4 here yeah well he does what's the difference in this line what's the catch and we've already seen this before just in a previous game today the catches that we have this d3 square and we have the same situation where we have this chain reaction of outposts that have opened up in addition to this monster pawn sitting on d3 which by the way is not easy to win there we go it's exactly like that previous game queenies ooh we need someone a sexy move instead i mean look at this look at our fonts here and on top of those pawns are going to appear a bunch of pieces as well so um this is actually horrendous for white and again it's going to take us a while to actually break this down but it's not a race uh it's it's okay he continues to push his pawns so there's just so many things we can do here um okay one good way of getting to his position would be to go queen a5 and i'll explain this move in a second what we're trying to do is do this but the immediate queen a4 is not as effective for what reason why why is queen a4 not um not that if it because of b how should we prepare queen a4 by which i mean how should we prepare against the move b3 we should go bishop e6 first exactly and then we go queen a4 and if b3 we can just take on b3 and then take the rook if he takes back we can even take okay thank you for helping us he literally just you know just abandons any ability to even play b3 and now we're gonna get right into his grill here and we can actually build a little queen bishop battery right in his face and go guindy one mate that would be one way to win if he goes bishop d2 then he drops b2 and he drops all the other pawns although we don't even need to take it i can actually show you guys a cool one there so yeah this is just sorry i mean g6 is ridiculously ridiculously innocuous okay goodbye let's blow him to smithereens here rook h2 yeah this guy is fooling around but um you know this is not always that easy to beat uh and and sometimes this kind of works against people who get intimidated and that's understandable but hopefully if i've you know had one impact on on you guys in the speed run it's that you're no longer intimidated by all of these weird systems okay so what should we do here well we should first let's first take the rook and we have a very nice move very thematic move in this position just blast everything open blast it all open e3 fv rookie 3 and the queen is undefended which is actually a very important thing to observe here otherwise this would not have worked uh so we still need to be accurate and we still need to make the proper observations oh he has this uh he's actually quite slippery let's get the other rook into the game he's actually quite slippery believe it or not and now we have rookie 2 as an idea we could have done that first it doesn't matter yeah so now rookie 4 makes sense to try to separate the queen from the bishop and then if he goes queen f2 when he goes queen f2 we're going to go rookie 2. no he doesn't do that he goes there give us that please thank you and then rookie 1 mate is going to be the threat as well as rook f4 yeah this is over and he resigns good game so a good lesson in how to how to uh beat these kinds of systems um yeah so notice that we we didn't play d5 immediately because the funny thing is this could have justified the placement of the queen and this is still bad for white i mean we can go e6 but you don't need to rush to play d5 in every instance so we go e6 then d5 um then we just develop now 95 again doesn't trap the queen because of queen e3 and then he can play f4 so that would be hasty but he opens up the e file for us which we occupy then the move c4 very instructive opening up the position or creating an outpost on d3 which we occupy well 4 200 subs that's ridiculous incredible guys thank you now we create this pawn wedge and we find a way to make inroads into his position so literally you identify a pathway to his king it's not rocket science okay i saw that this was one potential pathway and i asked myself what is stopping us from accessing the king through that pathway well wants to move b3 how can we go about taking the sting out of b3 we can go bishop e6 first by the way if he takes the pawn we can just go bishop b actually this is actually not that simple because now the queen is hanging but uh i suppose we could give a check first and then a check and then a check and then take the queen so that would be one way of circumventing that yeah we get here here queenie two is not mate i think some people were this is also not mate but uh the knight is defending the square so e3 breaking through and uh just taking everything so very simple game but nonetheless i think a good again a good lesson in in preventing uh and in dealing with uh this kind of crap that that some people play um so instead of bishop h2 chessgamertag says queen takes d2 um well then king takes and this is not checkmate although it's very close but it's that's another thing you want to watch out for you want to be careful about getting too fancy in situations where you're completely winning sometimes the business-like approach is a lot better
