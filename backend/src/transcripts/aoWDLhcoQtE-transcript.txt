[Music] let's go thank you guys again okay let's go e4 this time we already gone we went d4 a couple of times i knew five gifted oh thank you i know and okay i'm going to play an opening thank you so much anu for verdict city i'm going to play the c3 sicilian which i actually highly recommend to people in the 17 1800 rating range oh holistic hamster i don't even know what to do what to say and we're going to transpose the game into the advanced french which i'm hoping my opponent doesn't play dead man d for the sub and the move a6 already signals to me that my opponent isn't at home in this opening because this is kind of a pointless move right we weren't going to really develop our bishop to b5 anyway and there's no special way in which to play this position we simply need to develop our pieces thank you anu thank you guys we simply need to develop our pieces where should this bishop go where should this bishop go we're over 4 600 i can't believe this yeah of course d3 is the classic square uh oh john is in the chocolate so c4 closes the position entirely of course we'll keep the bishop on this diagonal and we will simply continue our development we don't have to worry about him going before um because he's not really very well developed now this is a closed position a lot of people struggle with these kinds of positions and i really want to delve into how to play these positions so i'm going to make a couple moves here without really explaining them and i'm going to explain them properly after the game but the basic idea is to identify the side of the board where we're going to attack and of course that's going to be the king side in the center and we need to figure out ways for us to get pieces onto squares where they can be prepared when the center opens now if we look at this knight on d2 where i want to get it is actually h5 if the knight lands on h5 and he goes g6 he's going to get checkmated on f6 how should we get that knight to h5 we go rookie one very typical idea actually i can show you many games that feature this idea we go rookie one and then we slowly begin the transfer of the knights h5 some of you might be looking at this and saying isn't this too slow well that's why that's why we allow ourselves to do this because the position is closed he's not even really open this actually helps us because the bishop now has very nice access to this square another five subs from anew thank you so much i know i really appreciate it and guess what he's just done he has allowed us to open up the position knight takes f5 and now a very very important move very very important move one movement might first let's go bishop a4 and then after he covers the knight very important move a very thematic e6 opening up the center guess what look at how a rook is positioned look at how our bishop is positioned now it's time to reap the rewards we take on on c6 and now there's several things that we can do one is to take on e6 which is the obvious move but somehow after king d7 he stays in the game we can also just position our knight to e5 and in addition to threatening the bishop what does this move accomplish what is our secondary threat here and that's really what's going to devastate him because he cannot cover both things at once that of course is queen h5 check followed by either a fork or a queen infiltration to f7 that's going to be absolutely deadly for black um so this is going to be crushing and uh he either has to try to cover that or yeah so he's covered the bishop but now we can go queen h5 and remember i always remind people well actually we're so spoiled for choice here we can play knight g6 and win his rook well let's go for the let's go for the big money here let's go for a very nice oh let me think for a second yeah so we have several ways to checkmate him here could somebody propose an attacking move here yep so a lot of you guys are seeing this we want to put the bishop on f4 bishop f4 would win the game on the spot because it would set up a discovered check but let's first take on c4 so that we can then go bishop f4 with check and that's going to send his king further into the center and then we can take on e6 with checkmate very simple stuff no need to go crazy okay and the game is over so he resides if he if he had got e5 bishop e5 would be may thank you joe nathan gifting to inaugura and continues okay um we had another sub there i missed from someone so um since this is probably a last speed on game for today let's let's look at it in depth now where did he messed up right so this is called the allopin sicilian i played this opening until i was about 1900 and then i played it several more times as a gm it's gotten very popular even at the gm level the idea is very straightforward you want to go d4 you want to go d4 and occupy the center which is you know the oldest trick in the book and black has to do something about it so our opponent decided to transpose into a french which a lot of people don't realize they're doing so e6 is not the best way to play for people who don't play the french black's main two moves are knight f6 and d5 both of which are very thematic because black tries to counter strike in the center before white gets a chance to play d4 uh there's a lot of theory there i won't go into it but basically that's the bottom line here there's plenty of places to study the alpha but i recommend it because it's so thematically strong right very classical opening now this is the advanced french and the move a6 is simply a waste of time which allows us to continue developing and the main continuation in the french as we've already seen several times is to quickly apply pressure on this crucial pawn on d4 try to get it to take on c5 and that would basically cause my central pawn chain to collapse that's why in the french black often does this in order to put maximal pressure on on the pawn on d4 now our opponent decided to close up the center entirely without developing any of his pieces so this already is quite dubious for black even though it might not seem that way right it might seem like black is completely fine and this is a little bit hard for me to sort of verbalize but the reason that white is better here is because largely because of the space advantage and because of the pawn on e5 if you guys look at this bond very carefully what squares does this pawn control it controls these two squares if a knight ever lands on one of those two squares black is going to be completely lost and there's no equivalent idea so black is very cramped this knight is nowhere good to go it went to f5 in the game and you saw what happened so black is super cramped white's got all these attacking ideas and that's partially why we bring our knight all the way to h5 so if he plays f6 that's the other thing the moment he opens up the center we see the huge disparity in how my pieces are positioned versus how his pieces are positioned you know that's like the nerdiest reference ever i don't know why i came up with this but do you remember when star wars like i think qui-gon jinn and darth maul are fighting and then he like i think darth maul forces like i don't know the terminology but there's like a force field and there's like a five-minute period where they're not fighting they're waiting for the force field to open back up i don't know if anybody knows the reference but basically the way to think about this position is like that fight i'm darth maul okay i liked qui gandun but you get the point so eventually the center is going to open that's just how it's going to be rarely do you have an entire game with the center being closed and when the center opens i'm going to be better prepared because my pieces are better are better placed i'm the better you know handler of the lightsaber so in particular i'm applying pressure on e6 and now i can still get the knight to h5 and uh that's basically the way to think about that i don't know if this makes any kind of sense and it's quite general but basically that's the reason why it's so hard to play these positions for black the moment the center opens which happens here my pieces just stream in e6 happens it all plays itself he's got all these weak squares and his king is just very unprotected because he's made all these holes in his position by pushing all these pawns out okay he shouldn't have gone knight f5 that was his decisive mistake probably knight g6 would have been better thank you king cookie for the sub and banded that gifting a sub as well of course i could have taken here and attacked this one but it's not quite as bad as in the game because the center remains relatively close now there was no way to stop bishop a4 the square is is very well protected by white e6 is super thematic right breaking through sacrificing the pawn in order to open up the position and get my pieces on key squares remember that when you push upon the square in front of the pawn can be occupied oftentimes very effectively by a piece can you go through taking advantage of a hole well that's actually a very very important concept the concept of pushing out a pawn and then occupying the square that has been created as a consequence of that i can show you guys many many very good illustrative games on that specific topic one comes to mind immediately since i got the question let me find that game it's it's not a famous game but i've always enjoyed showing it to students because of how thematic it is so watch uh what white does in the following position i'm just going to set up sorry one sec um i'm going to set this up on chess space thank you require for the prime and the subs continue okay so we need to do this this rousing against bates so i saw this game i think in a book by scottish grandmaster jonathan rousen who is one of my favorite really one of my favorite authors um he wrote several very interesting books on like chess psychology following position was reached in a game between jonathan rousen and this guy richard bates in this was 1997. so in this position roussen did something very very thematic and very very instructive the first thing that comes to mind if you look at this position thank you human for the bits is the fact that black has this bishop on f6 which is super strong it's controlling the long diagonal so rauson wants to shut this bishop down how does he do it can you guys apply the concept that we just talked about pushing out upon and then occupying the square left behind bingo bingo literally by the book now there's a tactical component to this because if black tries to take f4 notice that the queen is overloaded it's guarding two pieces at once we take on f6 we take on e8 and we're up a rook so black has to move his bishop out and then how do we now close the gates on mr bates so that okay that i promise i didn't think of that beforehand how do we close the gates on mr bates we go f5 and now the knight on e4 is completely unassailable look at this beautiful outpost white's got the pressure down the f-file and rousen wins the game just by crushing him down the f-file yeah so he plays a nice attacking game here we won't look at the rest of the game in detail but the attack is absolutely devastating here um okay so nicely done yeah so does this make sense f5 e594 so basically i even did this on the same exact file i did this on the same exact file uh the e file it's just that the e5 square was the one involved here not the e4 squares in the rousing games knight e5 queen h5 queen f7 we could have also won the rook here that would have been completely fine and now this move is good because it sets up a discovered mate but uh we did we decided to make the second move first and he resigns because well not because of this queen takes e6 would have been checkmate okay one sec um sorry with something off here um thank you dropkick john with a prime does this make sense does this make sense or does anybody have any questions in other words yes perfect so once again the c3 sicilian i would highly recommend people consider this if you're 1300 1400 it was basically the first type of situation that i actually played okay so obviously i want to play some blitz but we've still got over 5 000 viewers so i would not be against one last one to round off today's speed run okay and again i want to make it very clear that um okay i think i think i know where the people stand on this for what it's good to see people in agreement i think we need a little bit more of that and we have five more subs from curious chimpanzee keeps the train going 24 hours a day thank you curious jim fancy another five gifted and uh followed by 100 bits uh amazing amazing amazing over 4600 enzo 24 with a prime doom is on fire and flailing fanatical killer man this app this is just uh this is just remarkable okay uh just give me a moment just give me a moment so basically grant cardone continuing at the goonie 132 with the prime yeah we are approaching a 100k subs on youtube as well so thank you guys for that zoldor z with a thousand bits thanks for such an instructive series very happy that you're enjoying it um awesome thank you for the thousand bits man all right one last one here have i heard anything about pogchamps three no i have actually not but we will see i'm hopeful um six okay everybody ready what is your goal dream with this stream but before i go on um actually no real goal i mean again i've only been doing this for about eight months full time uh so i i will continue to balance teaching streaming playing very ambitious stuff but we'll see you know now streaming has taken off so i've been doing more of that but basically i'm doing it day by day i have no no long-term plan i just want to keep putting out entertaining and instructive content and that's all i could possibly ask for so this is just the beginning you know there's there's a lot more stuff that that that i want to do and then i want to develop myself in and you know this is just the opening salvo okay um let's go thank you and appreciate your support man okay so we're black against dion reyes and let's go with another situation let's see if we can okay so c4 is is not a great move um because it weakens and we've already faced this move once it weakens the d4 square which we can of course occupy by developing our knight and if we're thinking about where to develop this bishop should we proceed with g6 as if this were an accelerated dragon should we do that yes or should we instead maybe get the bishop yeah absolutely we should because that's conducive to the fact that we are now controlling the d4 square with even greater strength uh so oftentimes you have to decide are we sticking to the main sort of the the main setup and oftentimes the answer is yes now if you guys remember the last time we faced this i made a point about where to develop this knight one possibility thank you wheels for the prime is to develop it to f6 but the counter argument to that would be the fact that that knight would then block the bishop's control of the d4 square and i pointed out previously that this knight can sometimes go to e7 this looks a little bit weird but this is actually a very typical setup which we are going to adopt in order to let this bishop keep d4 under control in fact let's reap the rewards of that we're going to put that knight on the outpost and uh we can support it with the other night that's part of the reason why i really like this look at now our two nights both of them guarding each other and now we simply need to add some tabasco sauce okay how should we what do i mean by that well first of all we haven't completed our development before we jump the gun on anything let's castle to make sure our king is safe and now we have several ways to to proceed uh and and this is not an easy position to play well in overrated thank you for the prime so one possibility is to go f5 and try to open the position up and the logic behind that is that we have a beautiful knight on d4 we have better placed pieces than our opponent and as we've talked about on many occasions when we have better place pieces than our opponent it's often time to open up the center this is a risky strategy because we're doing it in front of our own king but remember he's also pushed out his pawn to g4 which has created for us a hook how can we now attack this hook with one of our pieces very logical this is how you attack we can attack this pawn on g4 by deploying what piece boom now he can push that pawn even further he does but he continues to overextend himself and when i say overextend himself what i mean is that his pawns are going to be a lot harder to defend if we can find a way to strike and you guys have found a way to strike with the move e5 you know we're trying to shatter his defenses this is a very risky strategy that i'm adopting here it might backfire i don't think it will but it might uh because we're also weakening you know i'm also weakening my position but if you can see this knight on d4 we're already reaping the rewards of that because knight f3 was a huge threat and um well what should we do now king h2 is not a good move he's sort of lost the threat of the game here and the reason is because he's weakened himself to such an extent that uh now his pawns well we don't need to go knight f3 there's no need for that we can simply play e takes f4 that pawn is going to go all the way to f3 it's going to send this bishop back and then we're going to have queen h3 once again it's one of those situations where there's no need to go for something crazy we can simply take the free pawn recapture with the knight now aren't we allowing him to remove that knight from the board well we are but uh look at the dark squares now around his king in fact we don't have to take back immediately although probably we should we could have also given a check first but his king is completely cornered so we're threatening queen h4 that's basically checkmate in two moves yep and his king cannot escape to g1 so you can see how quickly his position collapsed because he just moved too many pawns out in front of his king and that ends the game and uh basically very simple and logical strategy that we adhere to now c4 is not such a bad move if white knows how to follow it up but he didn't do it very well bishop g7 now this is called the botanic setup e6 right once again the reason that um that we don't go knight f6 so the knight f6 would be completely fine uh is because we relinquish partly our control over the d4 square the bishop is now not very happy so we find an alternate arrangement for the knight it rents an airbnb you know instead of uh instead of the bishop doesn't want a roommate here so we let the bishop keep its control over the d4 square and here my opponent missed perhaps his biggest chance to get out of the situation what should white have done here to rid himself of his main weakness thank you evan for the 11 months appreciate it and the subs just keep on going yeah he should have gone d4 himself just absolving himself over the weakness now our pieces are very nicely i like this position for black because my pieces are super harmonious the knights are linked but you know he can develop and we get sort of an accelerated dragon kind of position thank you for the hundred probably about fifty percent with elliressa over the years uh i could try queen b6 here but it's not the same thing i like your thinking though demon here's the main difference notice the bishop on e3 in that accelerated dragon trap right demon the bishop was unprotected so here he has complete freedom over to where where where to move his knight he can go to b3 and it's not that queen b6 is that bad uh but it could be a little bit more risky because that bishop is protected okay comparison is a very powerful tool to understand position now by the way we're threatening checkmate here so that's the consequences of weakening squares like this and now the key move f5 right opening up the position using this pawn as a hook and a hook is any pawn that's been advanced in front of a king and uh he should have probably yeah he's already in a tough spot here um i think white is worse i don't really see a good move for him maybe he should have taken here and maybe tucked his king away or something like this but i mean this is already very difficult and now we just get our queen and boom e5 striking weakening his position even further opening up our bishop all in the name of the attack you guys might be looking at this movement saying something smells wrong right we're weakening the d5 square yes we are but we're also weakening all of these squares in front of his king you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs and this is a very good epitome of that so queen to g4 uh threatening a fork because his bishop is pinned now we simply take the pawn he takes on d4 he weakens all the dark squares in front of his king although his position is already hopeless because f3 was being threatened and of course this is a very simple checkmate the king cannot cannot come back to g1 because the bishop controls this square what about bishop g5 of pentagon our queen well i'm not sure where you're where in which position you're referring to um the the seven deadly chess sins and um and chess for zebras as weird as that sounds uh are both fantastic books on chess psychology please explain the prophylaxis of moving the king to the corner yeah so why did i say what is the purpose of the move king h1 why did i say that this is what white should do great question well basically there's no mystery behind this move talking the king to h1 makes it a little bit safer why because the king is no longer on the g file and the g file is one of the main arteries toward the king right you you could see even in the game we put our queen on g4 the king is on the g file and so we threaten moves like knight f3 so king h1 would preemptively get rid of various ideas related to the g file and in addition he would try to turn this back around on me and put a rook on g1 and start to attack me down the g file so king a chain would be a very sensible response here both kings are now relatively safe for the time being because they're covered by the spawn they're not permanently safe they're not safe in a global sense but at least there is no immediate checkmate and there's no immediate attack so so that's why i think and that's why people often play king b1 when they castle long just to tuck the king away to a slightly safer square to make it harder for the opponent to get the attack started okay and in chess there's different types of moves there's a time to attack there's a time to defend and there's a time to make moves like king h1 i know people don't like to play these moves uh but you have to right you you that's what makes chess such a complex and beautiful game you have to put yourself in your opponent's shoes and and make things difficult for for your opponent and often that requires making slow moves like king h1 to you know make your king incrementally more safe so that you have more time to accomplish your agenda okay let's go e4 and he plays the french so let's play another oh no he doesn't play the french let me slap your king he plays d6 uh so this could be a bunch of different things he might be trolling us he might be playing the hippo in any case it's a good idea to just develop our pieces and wait for him to show what he wants to do now earlier i my strategy was to just developed as quickly as possible but now we're a little bit higher rated so we can take a big a bit of a bigger chunk of the center i can show you guys how to do this responsibly right now you don't want to do stuff like g4 right when you take a big chunk of the center you want to make sure that then you develop your pieces quickly and you develop them with an eye toward defending the central pawns so right now we're just developing our pieces and we are preparing for the proper moment to strike in the center look how passively he's developed okay so this is the last straw uh because now we've developed most of our pieces we have a huge center and just logically speaking goodnight akilah logically speaking it is time for us to strike what does that mean what does it mean to strike in the center what specific move am i looking to make there's actually two different moves that both accomplish the same thing yeah e5 is the classical method of striking then f5 was the other move we can play that on the next move if he plays d5 to close up the center which is a very common response we play f5 uh and before he gets a chance to breathe there we go we go f5 and he is going to get it i mean he's he's going to get destroyed here if he's not careful okay so well we should take on e6 open up the position even further if he takes yeah he takes correctly with the queen but he's done a very good job here of avoiding immediate disaster but he's still in very big trouble now let's play this methodically this queen on e6 i'm looking at it and i'm saying i want to get this queen out of here i can't go knight g5 because that bishop control that pawn controls the square how can we orchestrate a maneuver to get rid of the screen on e6 while also involving one of our pieces which perhaps isn't doing as much now good job knight e2 knight f4 another benefit of this move is that we free up the c pawn which can be used as a battering ram to destroy the rest of the center so let's get rid of the queen and now he's castled long which means we should immediately draw our attention to his king and ask ourselves how can we get to this king what are the specific weaknesses on his queen side and by that i mean we should be looking at pawns and i look at the a6 pawn and i say oh that's kind of weak let's attack the pawn while bringing our queen into the game we're also keeping oh okay um i don't think this is kind of passive so you only live once let's go e6 let's strike in the center again now what square and we get a chance to apply apply a principle what square have we created for one of our pieces when you push upon in the center create the e5 square now a move like f6 clearly introduces tremendous weaknesses in this position what specific square can we occupy not e5 of course he's defended that square but in doing so what has he fatally weakened oh crunch i mean look at look at these squares we win his rook he has nowhere to go bishop g6 would not have been the same because then he can move his queen that's still winning for white but this simply wins material he can't even get a knight for the rook he's in tremendous trouble here the position is he's it's over it's completely over we just take a full rook and we've retained and an item and we win the other rook his other rook also has no squares uh because of the pun on e6 this is quite a comical position uh we don't even have to take on d8 that's the hilarious thing and that's the thing that some people don't always understand is we don't even have to rush with capturing on dia because this rook is not going anywhere so let's first reinforce our pawn on d4 build a little pawn chain we could have also taken on a6 i actually forgot that pawn was hanging we should have done that but it doesn't matter we're up so many pieces okay now we should take on d8 because he wanted to go rook ca and now we can play bishop takes a6 and win another pawn now we want to be careful about as i've explained many times about over grabbing puns in such a situation we've got we've gotten enough now we can go about winning the game uh evil fair thank you for the sub now let's not forget what our initial plan was what was our initial plan with the move queenie too we were trying to attack the king's side the queen side so let's continue attacking the queen side how could we do that we need to do that by pushing up our pawns and opening up files preferably the a file so that eventually our queen could land on a6 in order to do that we have to employ a very typical strategy okay he's also attacking but he just doesn't have any pieces left we actually let's just sack on v5 because we're up a rook and an exchange so we can afford to sacrifice an exchange we shouldn't take on d5 because that walks into a discovery there are several ways of winning this game we could go queen d7 and simply trade queens because we're up a rook but there's no need to do that let's take on a5 and threaten checkmate so see here it's a judgment call you can absolutely you know the simple thing to do and i think people don't do enough that when you're up a rook and you're up a million pounds just treat queens so you won't give checkmate in this game that's okay you're gonna win the game we play to win the game okay so how should we exploit the undefended knight on f5 a very typical discovery and uh he loses everything here okay i'm sure we had some sort of a checkmate but uh why not why not simplify when we know this is going to guarantee the win let's cement the rook and now we're going to focus on creating a past pawn as we always do in this situation in fact he's done it for us always you know nothing surprising now look at the b-pawn that pawn's going to win the game we play to win the game okay we're not going to give up anything here i'm great i'm feeling greedy but before we do anything let's first bring our king in see i know i'm being pedantic here but i want to just re-emphasize how important it is to adhere to end game principles regardless of the position that that you have on the board because that helps you retain them when the position is more competitive so we're going to bring the king in then we're going to centralize the bishop and only then are we going to start pushing our past pawn glad to hear that x-ray in fact he's just busted because uh we don't even need this passport we're just gonna vacuum up all of his other puns the game is over yeah herm edwards yeah exactly okay he resigns okay so a relatively simple game because our opponent just played super passively in the opening textbook move e5 followed by f5 ripping open the center and um after f takes c6 if he would have taken with the f pawn what would we have done here to capitalize on the center being opened so bishop g6 is correct that's a very important check that's also why just like pushing random pawns is such a bad idea now some people are asking how did i decide on e5 and this is kind of an this is not a science right d5 would be fine but the thing is if you look at the c7 square right if you think about why you would go d5 this e7 square is very well defended by black so if you could try to quickly sneak in castles they don't really want to let black castle okay so d5 would have been possible as well okay so here we go 92 to chase the queen away okay knight f4 queen e2 identifying the weaknesses if he plays a move such as b5 how should we have gone about uh breaking down this pawn chain we should go a4 that hurts like hell because if he takes then he opens up this if he goes c6 then we can just slam it on b5 and this king is just going to be demolished here so that's basically the way to attack here instead he goes knight b it allows this move now if he if he would have taken on e6 we could have we could have gone 95 but we could have also just got knight 26 quite quite quite like in the game because his rook is gone and look at this move h6 that basically cost him the game uh well not written not only that but that was among the things that you know that that exacerbated the situation that's why you should be very careful as i said earlier about these random pawn pushes unless you have a good reason to do so bishop g6 here would have also been possible we could have gone after his queen but the simple approach is just to win a bunch of material and when more material and more material then open up the position by sacking and here of course making the simple decision to trade queens and capitalize on this huge material advantage once again you remain tactically vigilant until the very end of the game that's just part of the reason the chess is so brutal you can lose a queen just like that after playing a brilliant game it's happened to me a million times you know you you let your guard down for a second and uh you can manufacture a comeback with very limited resources which is why uh you must be vigilant you must respect your opponent and and you can never pre you know pretend that you've won the game or write one zero on your score sheet before the game is actually over because this kind of stuff happens [Music] you
