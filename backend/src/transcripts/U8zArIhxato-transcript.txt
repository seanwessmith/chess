okay it's too brute now he's playing the bird defense so against the bird a really good move in this position is actually bishop g4 which is sort of like the trumpowski now what is the idea of bishop g4 as in many of these openings you want to get the bishop outside of the pawn chain before closing things up with e6 now we're going to develop the knight to d7 and i'll explain why not knight c6 after the game we take the knight notice that he hasn't developed anything what pawn break do we want to prepare here for black what is the key pawn break to prepare and can we play it immediately yeah so we want to play e5 now the sam shanklin question as i always say can we play e5 immediately now a lot of a lot of you are thinking new because of queen 65 but remember white's made a lot of pond moves near his king which changes the rules of engagement for the center so if we play e5 and he takes the pawn we can deliver a very nasty check on h4 forces king to move and then we can castle along we'll have a huge lead in development his queen will be caught on the crossfire and uh we've only sacrificed the pawn so it's very important to always follow through on on this kind of question he's gone bishop b5 pinning our knight that's why we put it on d7 so that we could play c6 and blunt the bishop's control also enhancing our control of the center now we're just going to continue developing let's continue developing we don't need to do anything about the central tension we don't need to push by keeping the center open we are allowing ourselves to exploit our lead in development where do we want to put the f8 bishop where do we want to put or do we want to develop the bishop do we have an even better move we actually do so people are right but we we have a better move how can i find it i want everybody to notice that he's played h3 h3 has created a hole on g3 which is something you should notice what can we put on that hole we can put a knight there how can we put a knight there we can centralize it this also creates the threat of queen h4 which basically compels him to castle but that castles right into a fork we win an exchange and will basically be winning right out of the opening if he doesn't castle we can decide between knight g3 and a nasty check on h4 which i just mentioned so what i want people to understand is that when you're developing your pieces you don't want to just put your head down and develop automatically you want to also detect the holes in your opponent's position sometimes you can move a piece more than once in the opening if it means that you're exploiting a specific deficiency in your opponent's position okay let's see what he does well i needed to get more ice cream okay he's made a good move queen h5 now let's unpack this move for a second he's just attacking our knight if we go knight g3 he takes one knight with check and wins the other one so let's buttress the d6 knight by playing bishop d6 now sorry the e5 knight and yet again we're threatening knight g3 i don't see a good defense for him if he castles then once again we go knight g3 notice that the e5 knight okay so he's gone here now let's start let's let's try to understand what our priorities are in this position our number one priority the move that's going to devastate him like no other is if we can manage to put a queen on h4 right i know a lot of people are looking at discoveries one way of doing that is to go queen to f6 by threatening the check on f2 we are going to force this queen back and then we're going to relocate our queen to h4 what's another way of trying to get our queen to h4 what's another way of trying to dislodge his queen let's go queen f6 but i want people in the meantime to think about that question we could have gone g6 could have gone g6 attacking the queen forcing it back and then putting our queen on h4 that would have been a little bit more precise this move is perfectly good enough okay so he ignores the checkmate and the game is over so that's why i don't recommend these kinds of openings to players even in the intermediate range and we're 1500 so just to emphasize just to emphasize g6 would have attacked his queen if he sticks the queen on h6 actually that would have been a little bit nasty well now again now we can play queen f6 and he can't even stop us from coming to f2 if he tries to go g4 what move does he now allow and i'm sure this is not the only win by the way but but as an example what move is now possible we can go knight f3 and we can take his rook and we're threatening checkmate that's unstoppable because he has neglected the development of his king side okay we'll analyze this game later in the meantime let's continue next game okay let's go e4 and we have been playing several different openings now h6 is not a good move and the reaction that we've had against such moves is to prepare the control of the center with c3 which is what we're going to do here preparing the move d4 which we're going to play anyway i don't care that he's got knight f6 we're just going to control the center thank you derp bite for the tier 1. okay so how do we solve the problem now of the e4 pawn we have an intermediate move that we can make in order to solve the problem of the e4 pawn by the way we could sacrifice it that would be fine because we would open the e file for us and the common approach in this position is to go e5 now here i know a lot of people would rush to say we should take on d4 but let's think about this a little bit deeper what is the drawback of the move queen e7 the drawback of this move is that it puts the king and the queen on the same file so we actually now want the e file to be opened and we we want him in effect to take on e5 because that would set up a skewer nor do we need to go queen e2 we don't need to defend the spawn we simply need to prepare for the opening of the e-file by preparing to position a rook on e1 and we do that by killing many birds with one stone we castle in order to save his skin he's going to have to move his knight from f6 now and only now do we take on d4 notice that his knight from g4 is now stranded it has no squares so to add insult to injury we're going to just win his knight here now he a good player would play h5 but that doesn't really solve any of the problems inherent in his position we can still take on g4 by the way in that case okay well now he opens the f file for us now as i always say when we win material the most common mistake that people make is to forget the fundamentals they forget to complete their development and they run into problems uh but let's not forget to complete our development let's let's do that let's put in the time to complete our development let's go knight to c3 and once he castles we can also centralize our knight with knight to d5 that's a good move and then develop our bishop pile up on a lot of these weaknesses that he's created on his king side thank you tj rink for the prime appreciated my man appreciate it my man okay so let's centralize our night okay hopefully this is making sense to people another thing that we could consider doing here is to go knight f6 track and try to take his bishop out of the equation so that his king gets even weaker but there's no need for such extravagances we can just pile up on his h6 pawn this is sort of a classic method of attacking in such positions okay but now the temptation to play knight f6 has been raised because his queen is no longer guarding that square again what i want to emphasize to people is simplicity like the power of playing in a very simple fashion so we're actually not going to go knight f6 even though that's the move i would have played in a game we're just going to continue with our sort of conventional plan here and only now well okay so still we're not going to plan out f6 what would be the simple way to accumulate pressure on his king on his king's side let's say there's one more piece that we haven't deployed yet let's deploy it let's deploy let's deploy the last remaining piece which is the rook and i know that this might strike people as a very formulaic way of playing like okay where is the checkmate where's the sacrifices but trust me in order to master dania style you have to master the fundamentals of attacking which which is to say the art of bringing all the pieces in very patiently and doing the fundamental things very well okay now it's time it's the wax on wax soft method now it's time for some tactics this king on h7 is subject to a discovered attack sorry to a check by the knight on g5 but this check in and of itself is is a night blunder he just takes her knight but it could be used as a discovery down the f file by combining these two observations we see the move bishop takes f7 distracting his rook onto a square where it can be picked off with the discovery now some of you are looking at this and saying okay i get it why are you giving up two pieces for a rook isn't that good for black well no because look at his king his king is now encircled by our pieces we're still up in exchange on the next move we're going to take on g5 and basically checkmate him so how did i see the move bishop takes f7 what made me find it it's the fact that i saw that we have a check on g5 and one of the properties of this check is that it opens up the f file so if he has something on the f file that's vulnerable we can give this check in order to pick it off right you have to do this kind of observation all the time you have to constantly notice these sorts of things otherwise you're not going to find these types of tactics and and you know there were many formative books that that caused me to raise my awareness of this one little known book that i can recommend to people is called chess middle game combinations by peter romanovsky originally in russian romanovsky was a early 20th century chess master and he wrote a fantastic book on on seeing tactics so uh hopefully this game made sense to everybody let's play one more and then we're going to analyze let's play one more blitz game and then we're going to analyze all three we're going to play apache same rating as us right now okay so he's playing the sicilian we're going to play the open situation which i've been doing okay so he plays e5 which is called the kalashnikov variation it's a pretty common variation of the sicilian and black strikes in the center immediately but the drawbacks of this move are pretty evident right the drawbacks of this move are that it weakens these two squares principally square on d6 and square on d5 and we have to maneuver our pieces in order to exploit those and so knight b5 is the main line here and then we're going to bring up the other knight in order to access d5 the other weak square that has been created this is all theory by the way this is all theory and we have transposed into what's called the ceveshnikov now what we don't want is for our knight to be easily dislodged from d5 we want to keep this knight on t5 but what's preventing us from doing that is his knight on f6 so we're going to develop our bishop to eliminate it thank you socrates now and i'm sort of trying to explain why the theory is a theory this knight on a3 everybody should notice is very misplaced right it has no prospects so what we're going to go about doing is giving this knight some prospect particularly we want to maneuver it to somewhere civilized so we're gonna go c3 in order to deploy this knight through c2 it's not ideal but at least our knight is now doing something okay so this is the main line of the swashnikov so far he's been playing all the theoretical moves kudos to him now the other thing that people should notice here c4 is also a move by the way but it would weaken the d4 square but c4 is a theoretical move as well the other thing that i want people to notice here is that there's there's a pawn on b5 which is sort of sticking out like a sore thumb how do we go about undermining or perhaps trying to exploit the weakness of this pawn it's a very typical idea you'll see this also in the rye lopez you'll see this in a lot of openings yeah we go a4 to to try to break up this pawn and also deploy the rook via the a-file it's always nice when you don't have to move a piece and it already participates in the game i have read parts of reassessor chess although i wouldn't say that i've read the whole thing okay so let's see what he what he comes up with here all right so i think the theory maybe he takes the knight here i don't know then we'll take with a queen and the queen ably performs the task previously fulfilled by the knight uh maybe i should have supported my knight by playing knight c to e3 that's another way of doing it he takes and so will we and by taking he's also given our bishop a very nice square where where can our bishop now go to in order to support the knight well and c9 to answer your question we were waiting for the square to open up for the bishop development is not something that should be rushed all the time it's it's a priority but you should make sure that you're giving your pieces good squares before before you're developing now he's given up a pawn on a6 i think we're just going to snag that one if you don't mind that's a free pawn in my book now there is a little bit of pressure down the a file we should be careful about that particularly because this rook is unprotected but what i'm seeing is that i can later move my bishop back to b5 that bishop is going to simultaneously defend the rook on a4 so while this is something to keep an eye on it's not something to be overly concerned about okay so he takes we take as we know i don't really see where he's going with this i don't really see he could have taken with a rook but again i don't see a point to shy away from this tension i don't see even how he attacks this bishop another time and even if he does we have many ways to defend it we can defend it with our queen which is what we're going to do we're going to drop the queen back in order to lend some additional support to this bishop this guy is good though he's he's not going down without a fight but you can see that the cracks are beginning to show okay and now is a great time to show why we've deployed this knight to c2 there's a there's a move here that i call a glue move there's a move that glues together all of the disparate parts of white's position it stops the queen from attacking b2 it lends further support at the bishop and it just glues everything together very nicely that's the move knight to b4 as some of you are pointing out this is a glue move this guy is good as i said this guy is very good he's underrated but white is definitely better here okay b2 was also hanging out that's important f2 is not hanging because it's simply protected by the king let's see what he comes up with here okay now we have we have time for a simple prophylaxis what is the point of this move where is the knight going how do we stop it from getting there two questions let's answer them both the knight's going to f4 obviously how do we prevent it by going g3 right this is simple prophylaxis a good observation is that d5 square is also free we don't want to rush putting our knight there remember that the knight on b4 is fulfilling the crucial role of defending b2 thanks okay he's gone back excellent now we can complete our development by castling okay so he's gone f5 now you know a lot of people would be worried about this move oh my god he's opening the file but let's take a second and understand the drawbacks inherent in this move what is the drawback of pushing the f-pawn when you're castled one of them is that you by definition weaken this diagonal so what we need to notice here is that this check on c4 might be very strong in a couple of moves let's take on f5 let's if he takes back we're gonna make a discover check and his knight is gonna be lost i think he's noticed that so he's gonna have to give away another pawn he can't recapture on f5 well he did but this knight is defended by the rook this rook also defends the other rook which means it's overloaded by giving the check we are exposing the tension of the rooks boom and boom and we're up a night and we're up a pawn and we're winning so the the most important moment in the game was g3 this made him frustrated it made him frustrated he got impatient trying to create counter play and he fell apart very very quickly now he realizes it but it's too late okay let's capture the knight and now by the way if you notice the bishop and the queen they can combine in a battery threaten checkmate and the bishop on f6 is going to be lost as well because to defend against it he's got to give it up okay the art of attacking the king i'm not sure what book that's referring to okay he runs we're going to take it how do we continue harassing the king after it moves to f7 which piece can we deploy to attack the king and how can we deploy it also notice by the way the move knight t5 could potentially be a fork yeah bishop c4 or bishop g6 are both good now our goal here is to get the king onto e7 because that is a forkable square so we need to kind of assess all of the checks that we can make here including retreating moves in such positions people often misretreating moves and they are the art they are the glue that makes the attack run the bishop on g6 is cutting the king off from f7 as many of you are seeing good job guys queen h3 forces the king onto e7 that is literally the only move and that king walks right into the fork with the knight we won this queen and we won the game so the game is over good very very good okay and um you can see that we didn't do anything extraordinary we played the theoretical moves and he collapses quite quickly so very good kelly from sales gifting five subs to the community stoke in the fire really really appreciate that um legendary matrix gianlucille kendall jc one temper all getting subs thank you so much and 34.77 boys and girls incredible um really big fan of the glue metaphors i like blue moves okay so let's um which i think we actually explained the games quite well i don't think there needs to be any over explaining to do but let's just look at this game for a second now okay so boom this is all very simple now the move c4 here some people were suggesting is also very fashionable theoretically uh but the issue is that it weakens the d4 square so that move does have a drawback its strength is that you you get your development out faster because c4 occurs with tempo you you attack the pawn on b5 simultaneously i made a lot of night moves in the early going i did but he also made a lot of concessions which allowed me to violate some of these rules in particular he weakened the square on d5 and when you get to that level of 1500 you have to understand that these rules that you that you follow in a very linear fashion when you're a beginner you start to bend them very slowly and one of the rules you start to bend uh is that you you know you um you you can allow yourself to move the same piece more than once because opening theory starts playing a pretty big role and modern opening theory involves a lot of violation of of rules if that makes sense so it's sort of a negotiation between continuing to follow principles but understanding when to violate them at the same time yeah let's check the oh so somebody said we had high accuracy in this game let's see i'm curious now people were supplying the move so i didn't do much yeah 99 let's go so simple rules simple logic produces good chess okay um well every people were supplying the most to me i wasn't really doing much okay must be cheating that's right let's continue though one more pow mondatto 1577 and let's once again play the situation in the accelerated dragon which is the opening that i recommend to people in the 1500 range this is a move we've seen often knight takes c6 it's a mistake because he gives us greater mobility in the center greater ease of organizing d5 now we have some problems to solve the rook is hanging which means we should develop our knight and defend the rook at the same time yeah this is a theoretical line where they can go e6 and it seems like a lot is going on oh my god have we blundered he's discovering the attack on the rook in reality this is one of those lines where if you look a little bit deeper you find the black is doing completely fine because remember he doesn't have anything out yet so we're just gonna go f6 to block the queen's attack on the rook i know i said never play f6 but there's a reason why this is an exception and i'll explain that in greater depth after the game now one of the reasons why f6 is okay here is because the move f6 prepares what central advance what central advance is now possible with tempo because we played f6 yeah the movie five is now possible thank you t brown 03 for the prime yeah this is now possible and um not only is this possible but this is really good because we open up the bishop as well and where should we put this bishop we can put it on d6 for example we can also deploy our queen to b6 so it's actually staring at some pawns and potentially it's also permitting us to play bishop e6 to lend some support on this weakened diagonal that's exactly what we're going to do here in order to support this knight on d5 hopefully this makes sense okay now what should we take with and both both recaptures are fine but but according to sort of our way of thinking let's take with a pawn um here we go with this again let's take with a pawn because now we have we have a really nice pawn center we're going to castle to attack up to defend f6 we're going to castle to defend f6 okay bishop h6 so it seems like he's tossing us around but he's actually not uh he's just sort of he's making these moves that look active but the reality is we have control over the center um he has these two pieces that don't really do anything they're just sort of sitting there because our king's side is perfectly well defended where should we put our rook let's well we don't need to play g5 we don't need to kick his queen away from a square where it's already not doing much okay c4 okay now we can take on c4 and make a weakness or we can push d4 and we can expand our central control which is what we're going to do and then one idea is to play f5 and well g5 does strap the bishop but you've got to be careful about weakening your own king okay now well there's a couple of ways to approach this position we want to play e4 we can't do that yet so the simplest way to approach this position would be the simplest way to approach this position be just to play f5 and prepare e4 it's a little bit risky to introduce some more weaknesses in our king side but there's just no way that he can exploit them there's just no way that he can exploit them and um let's see what he ends up doing but e4 d3 is just a massive threat yeah he doesn't actually stop us from playing e4 that's partially why we positioned our queen on b6 that it guards d4 and allows us to prepare d3 okay how he could exploit it yeah maybe after the game yeah we could have also played a5 to sort of slow down the progression of his pawns but there's no need for that yet all right let's continue our pawn storm no need to no need to stop okay so there are some tactics here takes takes rook to e3 yeah so this is where this is where the tactics come in and the concrete calculation comes in so we have two ways to capture we can capture this bishop or we could capture this bishop the move that we should start with is the move that may yield the most benefits if it works which is d takes e2 attacking the rook has to go to d2 and in that position those of you who want to practice their visualization what is the move after d takes e2 rookie 2 to harass that rook and force material losses the move is going to be e3 right because if he takes e3 we're going to fork his king and his rook this is where concreteness transcends general appearances it looks like why are we partying okay so he gives up the bishop straight away without a fight now we're up a piece and now the win is very straightforward we can let's put our rook on a good square on an open file and now we can go go about playing down the d file we can triple on the d file and then focus on putting a rook on d1 which is going to be the simplest strategy and um we're in great shape here we're in great shape here and uh the royal triple but we would move our queen away from d6 in order to set up the possibility of putting a rook on d1 okay yeah load up alakine's gun that's also possible okay here comes ellicott gun the queen isn't doing anything and um this is not made because he takes and he goes rookie one so we should be careful about that but we can we can trade queens how can we force the trade of queens how can we force the trade of queens it was not made before either because he could have gone rookie one no no it was not made guys i did not miss mate because queen d1 he has rookie one immediately it's not made guys i saw that trust me i'm not i'm not gonna miss a back rank mate like this so this forces the trade of queens because if his queen leaves the rook then we simply take his rook and why is it good to trade queens here because we have control over a file uh and and okay now we're gonna play e3 just uh cement this past pawn we can play f4 later yeah so now we're gonna go rook d1 he's gotta go rookie one otherwise he's checkmated now it's a good idea to do this because we trade rooks and we've got to be a little bit careful our top priority is to is to support the pawn on e3 so we're going to go g5 okay we're going to carve out some real estate here we're going gonna go after this pawn and our secondary idea is to position the rook behind the pass pawn in order to preserve it okay let's move our bishop to f7 so that we can meet king f3 with bishop h5 check and dislodge the king from the pawn also that bishop is going to guard the e2 square so we're going to be able to push our pawn to e2 i mean i'm not really explaining my moves here on a granular level because there's many ways of winning such a position and i'm just making pretty straightforward moves okay he's good though he's he's playing resiliently and in order to win this we need to involve our king so let's go king g7 also if he goes h4 it's checkmate which is kind of funny he actually might go h4 thank you john cena appreciate it glad you're enjoying it this all most of this will be on youtube i don't put every single speedrun game on youtube because that would be cumbersome now we go h6 how should we follow up after king h4 what should we do what should we do we should take take on f4 step back to e4 and then we have connected passers then we have connected passers okay we're not going to let his rook take we're going to go bishop h5 and um yeah now it's very simple because the bishop has been charged with control of the pawn we can just move the rook to d1 and uh we can force the trade of rooks and then finally we can grind okay so he takes that's fine rook b1 takes and now we can just push our pawn forward that's fine i wonder who's going to win the ponderers we actually have to be careful f2 c7 we can't stop this pawn of course that would still be completely winning but we've got to be careful about that okay we can give up this pawn and win the other one it really doesn't matter just go around he should resign he should resign yeah and he does okay great that was an interesting game um let me see so i think one of the keys to the kingdom here was this move f6 uh you know you always say never play f6 but f6 does create certain weaknesses on our king side but on the other hand uh it it supports the building of a center and this is one of those other things i mentioned about weighing the pros and cons of a particular move and deciding that because he doesn't have enough stuff developed we can get away with something like this okay so it's it's always important to weigh the pros and cons of everything that you're doing particularly the move f6 so here we just can complete our development the queen b6 deploys our queen onto a really nice square what also makes this move good is the fact that he cannot put his bishop on e3 because that square is protected and um yeah we're in fantastic shape here now we put the other bishop on e6 we don't want to give away the knight on d5 that's our strongest piece and um basically that that that was what won us the game i think yeah and then then we just prepared the pawn storm and then we found the tactics if you've gone rook two in this position we would have gone e3 and uh he's in huge trouble because his rook well i guess he has rook t4 maybe but that then maybe we play up four actually and then again we separate his queen from his rook so this is just very very good good position for us we could have also taken the other bishop and and and kept our pawn chain but this is sort of place to the concept of transformation of the advantage uh so anyways guys [Music]
