all right we got an opponent 24 39 let's go let's go e4 [Music] and uh we're playing as candy okay so knight c3 is the move boy g-hub subbing himself thank you for the tier one okay so queen d8 is is one of the possible retreating moves by by the queen and uh the move here is of course to play d4 and to develop our pieces normally knight f3 bishop out to c4 we seek the most active squares for our pieces now b5 is already pretty weird and i'm not entirely sure you know what this move achieves other than create some weaknesses so let's complete our development let's castle now where should this bishop go where does the bishop on c1 belong in these kinds of positions so we just need to find the most active square and in my in my to in my view the most active square well y f4 i mean we can put it on f4 g5 yeah bishop f4 is a good move because it also supports the move knight e5 we're going to slam our knight into the center and the bishop does a nice job making sure that that knight is is more stable i also like the g5 score for the bishop so so why not white is slightly better here it's not not like black's position isn't terrible okay so he plays knight to knight to d5 now it's tempting to take the knight here but that would give him an improved center and uh this is one of those situations where you just have to keep the tension so we're just going to drop the bishop back and i don't mind it if he takes on c3 and seemingly ruins my pawn structure so after the game okay it won't yeah i won't have to do it after the game i'll explain it during the game why is this uh deficient pawn structure not actually as deficient as it looks well there's a couple of things first of all he's gotten rid of his knight which means that if we look at this bishop on b3 it now is operating relatively uncontested along this diagonal the second thing is and i've explained this on several occasions there is a visual deficiency in this pawn structure but on the other hand we have a lot of pawns in the center and they are defending each other so on the one hand this may look bad but it's actually a very solid pawn structure okay so we should play a4 we shouldn't let him uh trap our bishop let's go a4 and um rook bishop a6 okay so he clearly creates an x-ray against my rook what should we do how should we respond to this move very simple again no need to overthink it all right brandon i'll play one game and then and then i'll be ready for you yeah so simply rookie one and now you should immediately start thinking about various sacrifices and in particular what sacrifice or semi sacrifice am i thinking about here uh looking at these pawns on e6 and on f7 these pawns are quite a bit unprotected i mean they're they protect each other but that's right about it um so there's a very thematic idea here which is to take on f7 to remove the defender on the e6 pawn in fact let's do it knight takes f7 i'm going to do that pretty intuitively because at the very least at the very very least we are going to get uh two pawns and a rook for two pieces which is already a good amount of material but uh my bet is that we're going to get more than that if i play this correctly thank you software house for the prime because if we look around the board you guys should notice the rook on a what can we say about that rook well that rook is undefended which means that what are we threatening here in addition to just taking the rook what how what follow-up okay so he defends against that but what follow-up were we threatening we were threatening a fork on f3 yes all right now we really have a have a wide choice and we have to figure out what our priorities are now it seems to me it seems to me that it probably makes sense to try to get this rook uh and attack this rook as much as possible while we have the chance we don't want to take on f7 prematurely because that rook isn't going anywhere it's pinned so let's go let's go queen h5 let's get the queen out and let's put even more pressure on this rock hopefully that's going to lead to something good and this concept is a very important one the fact that we're not in a hurry to take the rook a lot of people would grab that rook first and think later but uh we obviously don't need to do that because we're not in a hurry and now um again we have several approaches to this position we are still not in a hurry so we can take other stuff first let's play a takes b5 first and notice that this pawn on b5 stops his knight from getting out to a6 or c6 so he's completely paralyzed on the king side we have three pawns now and um you know and bishop takes f7 is going to come at some point we still don't need to take we can still move our queen and we're still going to be able to take his rook at our convenience now we have a very crafty move with our queen very clever little move to e2 could somebody tell me what the idea is of this move why are we bringing the queen specifically to e2 and not to say g4 or h3 or d1 what are we accomplishing with this move thank you caulisten life yeah so we're looking out at that bishop he has to move the bishop but now we think about well what is he weakened by playing bishop f6 what is he left unattended or at least relatively unattended if we think about it we ask ourselves that question well notice that the queen is overloaded because on the one hand the queen is tasked with defending um f7 on the other hand it kind of has to take on c5 so dc is a very simple move here which kind of overloads the queen and uh he can take on c5 i mean i don't see a checkmate there but in the event that he does we can just bring the rook in and then we can take on f7 and just crush him in the center and on the king side so he can also play bishop takes c3 i know perhaps some of you are worried about this move okay so he does play queen 65. now notice that we still have not taken his rook and i look at the rook on a1 and i say this rook could be occupying a super juicy open file on d1 which we're gonna do and only on the next move when all of our pieces are in the game are we going to take his rook and go after his king we had other ways to win i think we could have taken immediately and done queen e8 and bishop takes b8 i'll show that after the game but i think this is the most clinical method because it ensures uh that all of our pieces are in the attack which gives us almost this kind of insurance right if something doesn't work out uh it's it's a good idea to have all of your pieces involved because then you're going to have quite an abundance of of resources in case what you wanted to do initially isn't as good as you may have thought okay so now we can do what we were planning to do on the previous move we take on f7 and now between these two checks queen e6 or queen eight which one do you guys think i should give well queen eight is not checkmate but queen e8 is the better move and the reason for that is a very simple one we want to put the rook on d7 but we can't he has got a knight on b8 that's guarding that square but we can actually just take that knight we simply win the night but the point of that move isn't so much to win the night although that's a nice um byproduct of that the point is to get that get our rook to d7 which is going to be the killer blow to black's king so black is absolutely busted here he's out of defensive pieces and his king is just toast not to mention he's now down in exchange so he just left his center unattended and that's what happens when you do that okay queen g5 we still have to be careful uh because he is threatening checkmate in one move now what would be the simplest winning move here and i always advocate for this rather than going headfirst into the complications we have a very simple move here that doesn't require any calculation and it wins the game on the spot so and the move here is well it's not f3 f3 is a little bit too passive if we look at this bishop we can notice that it's undefended the bishop on b7 is undefended and um we can either play rook d7 rook takes b7 but i even like queen between d7 and queens xb7 because that wins the bishop um you know and attacks the rook on 88 at the same time so queen d7 and her resignation from black brandon i'll be ready in just a second so that's basically that um and that was a nice game i mean that wasn't anything extraordinary but it was candy we developed all of our pieces okay we developed all of our pieces so so b5 is already a little bit dubious uh because while this move does grab space on the queen side it has a there's a negative part to it which is that it creates a backward pawn on c6 and it saddles him with these queen side weaknesses which actually later came back to bite him so e6 also i would probably develop my bishop uh behind the well in front of the pawn chain before playing e6 so he developed a little bit passively although he didn't do anything terribly wrong um 95 95 and here was i think the first critical moment i think a lot of people would be tempted to take on d5 but this you know this actually helps black bring another pawn into the center it shuts down the bishop look at my bishop now it's just biting on this d5 pawn and black builds up this very nice pawn chain and um you know white doesn't really have anything to show for maybe white is slightly better here it's very very important to resist the temptation uh to you know to do this kind of stuff to capture a piece just because it's uh it's tempting to do so okay so bishop g3 um and he takes on c3 i think this is actually a mistake i think this is actually a mistake because it as i explained it does two things both of which are good for white the first is that it leaves me with a very strong diagonal this bishop on b3 is now essentially uncontested along that diagonal which creates these tactical opportunities such as knight takes f7 uh the second thing is that these pawns are actually good even though they're doubled even though they're isolated uh you know i call this like shedding your skin we can play the move c4 in the future let's just let me just play a random move for the sake of illustration and the great thing about this is that i can then push my other pawn up to c3 and i can get the best of all worlds i can disrupt his his queen side pawns and still have that central pawn chain as a consequence of the fact that i have two c pawns so that's why i'm on a crusade to show people that double pawns are actually kind of good okay so we a5 is met with a4 and now bishop a6 is almost the decisive mistake i just think he didn't realize that these pawns although they protect each other are very much susceptible to this kind of a tactic um i think that my opponent should have probably done some damage control maybe gone queen v6 and tried to get this knight out of there as quickly as possible although black is already in quite a bit of trouble here so bishop a6 rookie one c5 and this is really our only chance to play knight takes f7 if we if we screw around and we could also play queen f3 that might have even been a better move but if we screw around too much if we play the move d5 what does black have here black has a very nasty little move which shuts down our bishop what move am i talking about well that and that's exactly what i'm getting too curious so the move is c4 and we don't want our bishop to be shut down so we really only have this one opportunity to get the bishop to e6 so that the move c4 is no longer effective now if he plays c4 here uh then he loses his queen or taking on f7 and attacking his his queen now another question would be what what would have happened if he taken on f7 with a king and although he doesn't lose the exchange here i mean the king is very easily checkmated with a couple of very natural attacking moves and his position just collapses here you should just see that visually there's really nothing to calculate here so rook f7 bishop e6 he plays bishop b7 once again if he would have played knight c6 white supply and win who can find the most technical winning idea how do we go about winning this and i actually kind of mentioned the correct idea already um but we can just apply yes so so we need to get the order right yeah queen f3 is good enough but even taking on f7 first and then playing queen f3 and picking off the knight so when your opponent has a weak kick uh in addition to looking for checkmate ideas always look for forks undefended pieces become particularly important when your opponent has a very weak king because that king is going to be susceptible to various checks and if you have an abundance of checks and chances are one of those checks might also be a fork that's why i was paying such careful attention to the fact that his rook and a8 was undefended so bishop b7 queen h5 and increasing the attack on his queen and now after queen fe we simply play a takes b5 we grab a pawn we prevent his knight from getting out to c6 or a6 the rest of the game is very simple we need to x ring the bishop then we take upon overloading his queen we bring the rook into the game and then the final stage of the game where we just basically take all of his pieces so very simple game we developed our pieces we seized our tactical opportunity and then we didn't rush taking that rook on f7 we only took it when we were absolutely ready to take it and we brought our pieces into the game first before taking that rook which made the attack so much easier to conduct uh bishop d6 oh bishop d6 is probably even better yeah uh oh you want to give a checkmate but maybe black has queen c8 here maybe black has queen c8 here and then of course you can't give this check because i'm just gonna take your queen um what do you mean b5 seems counterintuitive you mean eight takes b5 well not at all i'm just taking a pawn at the end of the day i'm just taking a free pawn that's all i'm doing so it's not terribly counter-intuitive to just take a pawn yeah that was a great game um and it just shows that if you really adhere to these basic principles you can be pretty good players and it doesn't always take crazy amount of creativity or imaginativeness to win these kinds of games we're doing the speedo into 2500 120 points of away okay so let's play ray lopez despite what i revealed yesterday about ray lopez okay so he plays a petrov this is called the petrov defense and there's you know there's a lot of good good lines against the petrov but uh one line that sort of flies under the surface if he plays the move d6 is the move knight to c4 that's a bit of an odd move because it seems to obstruct the development of the bishop but um the point is that the knight is very well placed here and we're going to get the bishop out to d3 not everybody knows this variation okay so d5 that's an interesting move okay let's let's get this knight out of here let's play knight takes e4 and then next thing is thank you for the prime and then this pawn on e4 can we can we deal with this spawn how can we deal with this pawn what should we do so so there's two two different ways of of playing this uh we can play the move d3 and and try to get rid of it directly but another good way of doing it is to play the move d4 and either he takes on poisson and helps our bishop develop or he has to let this pawn remain on a very nice central square so he does the second thing and the bishop can just come out to e2 remember not every piece needs to be scaling mount everest at any given moment this kind of development is perfectly good enough and this knight on c4 it's fine where it is because it's controlling it's controlling a lot of central squares it's nicely placed on c4 that's not necessarily a very typical square it's also defended by the bishop so if he plays bishop e6 which is quite likely then we don't really have to move the knight away okay so let's castle and this pawn on d4 we can see that it's only defended by the queen okay so first of all let's deal with this bishop where should this bishop go where should the bishop on c1 go should it go to d2 should it go to e3 should it go to g5 well it shouldn't go to g5 because he's just gonna take it it should go to f4 we're also blockading this pawn if he goes g5 that's very weakening i mean he might go g5 but okay he doesn't but that would be a very weakening move okay so now um i feel like this knight on c4 has overstayed its welcome and there's a very good night there's a very good night for this square there's a very good square for this night where what what am i talking about here that knight is being pressured i know i know that i said we don't have to move the knight yeah so e5 is one good square but even the e3 square i actually like the e3 score because from e3 the knight potentially supports the pawn move d5 which would grab more space he goes g5 i saw this move the bishop repositions itself to e5 which is a nice central square and he's he's really weak in this king so although he starts this pawn attack it's a very very double-edged sword what he's doing okay now let's make the move bishop c4 let's try to trade off his bishop and soften his king up even further uh i don't think he's worse here but it's definitely a bit of a tough position to play for black but he's playing it very very well so you know it's anybody's game right now it takes takes now our knight is is nicely centralized but if he plays the move bishop fc bishop d6 um oh he's played this really well uh for sure but um one way that we can try to exploit uh the weakness of his king whoops sorry is is to get the queen out to h5 so let's do that all right let's go queen h5 now he can take our knight in fact i think he probably will and bliss queen e7 okay so ideally ideally i'd want to preserve this knight he's threatening kind of to capture it well the move f4 allows g takes f4 and then if rook takes f4 then he takes on e5 so there's nothing wrong with making the occasional retreating move let's play knight to c4 and then an eventual idea whoops wow 11 wins and one loss this guy's good 11 wins and one loss so let's let's get the rook into the game he lost to a 1600 though in bullet though in bullet hmm yeah i'm telling you guys at this level i i keep playing these weird guys okay let's go d5 let's get this pawn into the center yeah i'm definitely getting the sense that i'm being outplayed right now but we'll see so let's go d5 queen g7 okay let's let's lock him up let's lock up the queen by playing c3 that game had 99 accuracy no yeah the pacing i i could sense in the pacing that something was a little bit off i can sense in the pacing that something is a little bit off uh it's like you know it's it's the five seconds of move kind of thing but it's fine we're gonna we're i mean i'm still i have a decent position i'm definitely worse now we're gonna get our queen back and then he's gonna probably play a6 let's try to disrupt the position with a4 so if it's five seconds of move how many moves do i have to survive to survive like 40 moves okay so of course he's gonna think on eight takes b5 and he's gonna think precisely five seconds uh let's go knight c2 let's try to get it to d4 yeah this is this is looking quite quite suspicious but we are going to try give it the old college try if i beat this guy then i will go down in glory no there's a lot of these people at this level unfortunately five minute games you we have seen that it's just it's just unbelievable honestly um the amount of people that um but we're not okay oh rook z3 ah without rook t3 um yeah i'm just busted here let's go back to d4 he's gonna probably play f3 yeah we we got him down we we boiled him down to like a minute and a half the problem is i'm pretty close to getting checkmated here i don't play against entrance but how do i know this guy how did how was i supposed to know that this guy is cheating well i don't know i don't know that he's cheating i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt we always do we always give these people the benefit of the doubt and i'm not going to make any claims until we check the game with an engine uh yes the pacing is certainly suspicious it calls for for checking him but you know i always bring up the analogy of imagine that you were the one playing really well you know would you want it if people accused you willy-nilly of cheating and i think the answer is no yeah it's the five second moves okay so i'm gonna play d5 here i mean i managed to play pretty well here i think given the situation how does he actually win this i'm not sure okay he's below a minute now if he goes to work out four i thought i can give him a check and then go okay he's got an only move here and he takes the same amount of time okay let's play h3 to stop checkmate no i don't think he's i mean i'm actually probably not worse here i don't know it's just the pacing is so weird it's literally every move is five seconds but i think i'm fine here okay let's just go queen g3 to prolong the game as long as possible because i know i'm not gonna get checkmated um i know i'm not going to get checkmated within the next like five moves and i have a feeling that he's going to lose on time or at least i'm going to try to make him lose on time i mean just flag him sounds very easy but when someone's playing this well it's not that it's actually not that easy i'm trying to not get trackmated at the same time okay here's another move we survived another move oh king h5 okay so let's just go b4 yeah he's not gonna make it at this rate king h5 king h4 look at that idea no he's gone unbelievable and you know what else is oh and there's a mouse slip oh my god we got him ranja moma thank you all right let's analyze i'm looking yeah baby strong oh gee 90 92.6 but his last couple of moves messed with the uh let's see [Music] i mean he's either really good or he's already i mean he he played most of his moves were best oh okay rook f6 is a blunder though which is a really weird move nobody would ever play that yeah and then he started playing best moves again wow king h5 is best okay yeah yeah yeah it's um definitely very very very suspicious and and that's honestly why we should probably stop the five minute speed run it's very sad but it's just how it is unfortunately
