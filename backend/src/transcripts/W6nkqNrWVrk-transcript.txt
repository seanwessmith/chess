[Music] chess lebanese salah 2120 let's go e4 and we are white again i've been white in four games in our own speaking of the french he's done it so i am going to play what i actually normally play against the french which is called the tarash defense i will talk about this move after the game and he takes on e4 that is the rubinstein french it's what andrew tang plays it's a very solid opening uh it's not like that good and knight f6 is considered to be quite inaccurate and the reason why is because he has to ruin his pawn structure very early now there's nothing that we need to do specifically here we'll just develop our pieces knight f3 and let's think about where we want this bishop to go where should we deploy this bishop the move is bishop d3 and what we're going to try to do is root out this bishop on b7 this is his only strong piece so if you're thinking ahead if you want to get rid of this bishop or at least contest it what idea can you guys come up with that may allow us to do that because his bishop can can get very annoying particularly if i put castle and f w nietzsche and your quick queen e2 is the move not only are we insinuating well we can play bishop a6 but mainly i was thinking of bishop e4 and um well the question is sorry can we play bishop a6 let's calculate a little bit bishop a6 if he takes and then he takes on d4 who can visualize that position and tell me what move white has in that situation bishop a6 captures captures and then he captures on d4 that's a type 1 undefended piece which we can fork by playing queen a4 i will illustrate that obviously after the game in the interest of time i i have to make some moves so we actually can trade the bishops what happens if i do it anyway at this level you got to start questioning basic assumptions right and you got to start calculating variations more intensively that's just part of the part of the process you can't reason your way out of everything uh sometimes you need to just plunge in get your hands dirty and and that becomes increasingly the case the higher rated you get so he's gonna have to decide what to do about this trade uh he can take the bishop but that would get my queen to a nice spot he could support the bishop on b7 and i would definitely take it and then i could potentially strike by playing d5 using the pin so we'll see what he what he decides to do he's thinking no plenty of people mentioned queen eight four oh crap i saw this move now he came up with a very clever idea he's winning upon he's switched up the move order of what he's done and he wins upon i did see this and why did we go for this anyway because look at his position first look at his king his king is caught in the center the board is wide open so i made a judgment call that my compensation what i have in exchange for the pawn here is going to be sufficiently weighted to warrant giving up upon maybe i'm wrong that's a pretty risky judgment call to make but a pond is not such a big deal to where we can never come back even if this turns out to backfire he can't he cannot castle right because we're stopped even if he could even if he finds a way to castle short which is quite likely his king is still going to be weak there and that's what the battle is going to revolve around okay um what should we do here how should we and we should definitely yeah so we should absolutely continue our development we can do that in several different ways we call it bishop f4 or yeah definitely followed by rook d1 that part is obvious um but i actually like the idea of getting the bishop out to f4 a little bit of a more active square and if he goes bishop d6 i kind of like the standoff that happens between the bishops i kind of like it because that adds some spice to the position and the other thing which may look irrelevant is that if he ever castles short keeping the bishop on f4 will keep the avenue open for a potential rook lift we had the bishop on e3 uh we wouldn't have been able to lift the rook it goes rook a rook to g8 potentially sort of pressuring this pawn okay so this guy is very good obviously uh and now we are going to go well let's see well let's go work do you want any i don't see the danger yet he's going to go here and then we're going defend the pawn on g2 defend against checkmate okay no i don't believe we're in the range of my rating right now um if you add a thousand points then we won't be so how should we defend this pawn without making additional weaknesses to our king side so f3 is possible but that opens up a diagonal i actually kind of like f3 though uh but that's yeah let's go bishop g3 let's uh let's drop the bishop back intercepting his rook well i've been sweating and i'm gonna lose eventually because i'm also talking through the games which does you know it does make me a little bit slower now we need to lift our rook up in order again to add some some tobasco sauce here there's two ideas with this move the first is potentially to go to c3 the second of course is to double rooks using this main artery toward his king so we're trying to do here is deploy all of our pieces and and get the attack started against black's king which is now permanently stranded in the center he's moved his rook which means he's forfeited his right to castle aren't we just losing more puns well we're sacrificing them right i don't care about pawns here i'm keeping my eyes on the prize uh so we actually could play fg and open up the f file but i'm gonna play hg here because fg also creates some weaknesses in the range of our king and i wanna keep my king very safe i don't wanna have to worry about that okay rook g5 lifting up his own rook that's an incredibly good move actually and um what is he threatening here and what should we do about it this is a a brilliant move so he wants rook a5 trapping our queen which means that we need to play a a move that that has that in mind so let's go rook to f3 to evacuate or offer the queen in evacuation zone 2 to d3 for example and then let's see what he ends rook c3 would have led to rook c5 again after we have a lot to discuss here and we'll look at some of the concrete variations after the game um and um okay rook a5 now according to plan we drop our queen to d3 we attack two pawns at once but he's i think he's foreseen this yeah he has so now well there's a couple things we can do right first thing we need to ask ourselves do have we deployed the rest of our pieces and the answer is no right uh rook to e1 would create the pin against the pawn on e6 deploying the last rook i realize that i'm leaving all these pawns hanging for most of the game there are tactical reasons why he can't really capture them and even if he could if i sacrifice two more pawns that's not really going to change the makeup of the situation i'm going for checkmate here um so let's okay we got to drop our queen and i keep tempting him into capturing more pawns uh which i think is actually going to be good for me let's see if he doesn't he he's just incredibly good um extremely underrated but i think he's legit so we're gonna go queen g5 here involving the queen and trying to penetrate to g8 okay let's see what he does okay rook uh queen to d2 what should we do how do we avoid the queen trade and if you give a check on g8 then you allow king e7 so what we can do is we can intercept good job nanuka we can intercept the queen by playing rook to e3 and we're actually threatening something very devilish right now we have a quite a pretty threat and let's see if he sees it he does which does not surprise me but um just because i kind of talked smack about puns doesn't mean that we don't want to take them if they're lying around on the table and well here they are we can take on h7 and that queen can swing back to h4 and continue the attack we're just trying to continue poking and prodding and uh and hoping eventually that something will give attacking is is is is an art not a science and now i'm going to deploy my queen to g maybe come to c8 you know i'm trying to poke and pride get him low on time that's all very viable okay that's another very good move by him let's give it a check yeah he's outplaying me now let's drop the queen back the worst thing that we can do here is trade queens that is the absolute last resort right we don't want to trade queens okay so let's go check and if he goes queen f6 what we're gonna do and wow he spots that as well so here just give me a moment let me focus yeah this is my territory but this guy is actually unbelievably strong good shotgun i'm winning yeah so okay good game um yeah that guy was really good really really good and um i have to say yeah his defense was absolutely stellar well yeah at some point i i have to step step up um and i don't think i was ever losing per se but i i did not expect the attack to go as poorly as it did so let's deconstruct it and um and then we'll end there thank you for the hundred bits of lasagna yeah let me check i'm just curious very quickly what yeah i'll check the percentages uh probably uh we i mean i played terribly but yeah so it's um 90 for me to 88 for him um so we both played pretty well i mean yeah okay a lot of people are underrated at this at this level so anyways now knight f6 is not considered to be the best move now um knight d7 is is the best and uh now knight f6 so the reason is you want to be able to recapture with the knight uh not not the pawn or the queen both of which contain uh their drawbacks right if if queen takes f6 then we saw this in one of our games right we all of a sudden trap the queen with oh 1000 bits thank you innovative and the queen is no square so that happened in an earlier game we played but he took with a pawn which does have the benefit of opening up the g-file we saw that he later exploited that oh fischer sub your your chest lebanese saw nice so basically i guess the bishop a6 was wrong um and what should we have done instead in retrospect if we wanted to defend this pawn what should we have done what should we have done c3 right creating the pawn chain and then patiently either bishop a6 or bishop b4 now i saw this move uh and the idea is you interpose the move or remember if he would have taken here first and here second we would have gone queen to a4 forking the knight and the king so he decides to take your first of course we cannot take the bishop because he takes the queen now he takes on a6 intermediate move and queen takes part so i had to calculate it up to this position and concluded that because his king is so stranded in the center um white white is in good shape but i was wrong i made the wrong judgment call and there was a very specific reason that i made the wrong judgment call my mistake and i'm learning from this i i failed to notice one very specific thing i overestimated the role of the d-file i thought that i would be able to get a rook to d1 quickly and win the game what did i miss what did i not what did i fail to sort of account for fully what defensive idea not the counter play on the g file that wasn't dangerous the idea of bishop d6 that bishop on d6 is solid as a rock and once he puts it there it shuts off that main artery to his king and the fact that he's got bad pawns and the fact that he's in castle just isn't that important so what i tried to do now is bring as many pieces into the game as possible and once the bishops were traded that's just not something i anticipated he brought his pieces out the d file stopped being relevant he started b he started just controlling it now one thing i wanted to point out right at no point could he have taken the pawn with impunity queen takes c2 allows rook to c3 and now i take on c sub uh and and he's under devastate so i just wrote g5 is the only way to preserve the advantage that's a brilliant move so i go rook f3 to evacuate my queen rookie want to deploy my rook and here although what black is two pawns up objectively black is probably winning the king is still under some fire queen takes f5 by the way looks tempting because the pawn can't take the game but remember he's got a rook there that's guarding that squad that spot okay so queen g5 rook fe3 of course uh avoiding the queen trade now could somebody spot my threat i i had a very very pretty idea and let's say he takes on a2 who can spy the tactical concept here [Music] yeah you guys all are all sharp rook takes e6 he's correct now we sacked the rope to open up the king of king d7 then we win the queen and the rook if king f7 this is checkmate and if king f8 this is the nice part um it we're actually it's the mate is not that easy here but we give a check another check and made on e6 kind of pretty line so typical sacrifice but nonetheless uh salah was on on top of that and we won one of the pawns back he got it back and eventually we got this kind of position where black's got three connected pass pawns all of them extra extra but i think salah in time pressure he allowed some activity so what should black have done i think what black should have done here is try to trade pieces as quickly as possible so in light of that what move would you propose for black hair esteban gc thing for the sub or k1 yeah it kills it kills the play because the reality is black can win with rook d1 here and just go for the checkmate but even if you didn't do that even if you drop the queen back that's also fine because you eliminate all the counter play but in in time pressure he allowed queen f6 and now things get very complicated after rook c3 are no longer worse king c8 tucking the king behind the pawn shell was the last chance to preserve a big advantage for black but after king c6 i drive the king into the open and then i slice off the uh you know the defense of the rook on c6 winning winning a full oh i missed made in one actually that's pretty funny i i missed made in one with queen takes a seven i basically pre-moved in my head queen takes c6 so not my best performance i'd say but uh not to take a single thing away from chess lebanese sally played like a monster um he played like a monster and um he you know he did a very good job fearlessly going for that position which i'd evaluated as it's better for white but um you know that was a key mistake and what what i take away from this game is not to you know to spend longer evaluating the compensation i think i have right try to recognize things like a square on d6 which would shut down the main source of counter play can i square rook 81 was preferred of her rook after one well because now if you go rook after one i always advocate to think about the other rook now the rook on a1 is no prospect whereas if you go rook 81 then this other rook could sit on e1 and x-ray the king um why did you go bishop f4 instead of bishop well by that point i want him to play e5 because that pushes out a pawn that creates weaknesses and uh that also creates a hook and i could attack that hook by playing f4 in the future so i want him to send forward his pawns um queen b7 but what is that really i guess i should have done this but he can go rook d8 and i wasn't in the mentality to like try to win back the pawn i thought that i have sufficient compensation for it oh after this yeah but queen b7 queen d5 at the very least he's got forcing an end game or again you can go rook d8 and if you play queen c7 i guess he can capture and win back the pawn with rook c8 so to me this seemed a little bit too um to vanilla okay so since your queen dominates the queen side yeah but harvey the problem with that was that it would be too slow right that's that's a good idea in theory but it's it's just not gonna work out because the thing is one two three four i mean there's like five six moves and black has these ideas of opening up the g file it's just not gonna be not gonna be swift enough if that makes sense okay but um by and large that's how the game went good job to my opponent and our first 31 2100 and uh he gave me a run for my money for sure here we go lemon buffalo okay dolphin dobrin 357 so let's play an accelerated dragon okay so bishops bishop f3 oh sorry bishop c4 and knight f3 uh we've tackled this many times at a at a lower level it's not as common at a 2000 level uh and basically we already know that black's main strategy is to prepare the move d5 now queen e2 is a very subtle move he's preemptively pinning the king so d5 would would meet with e takes d5 uh and that would not be a good result because then i wouldn't be able to capture back because of the pit uh but we shouldn't panic here and we should be very careful about playing bishop e7 because that would allow him to clamp down on us with e5 so let's play d6 in order to take the sting out of e5 and now just continue developing normally that doesn't mean we won't play d5 we still might play d5 and it's okay to lose the tempo because white hasn't placed his pieces in a very threatening way so d5 here would be a very sensible move in fact we're gonna play it no problem playing this move uh e x c x thank you for the prime now what should we do who can tell me a good idea in this position how should we go about playing this position so knight a5 is possible we can go after the bishop um we could also go b5 and expand on the uh queen side but i want to make a move that a lot of people would look at and kind of roll their eyes i'm gonna play rookie a thank you jackie why am i playing rookie and i'm going to explain the the sort of the psychology behind this after the game but the mover kid is sort of a general improving move i'm kind of waiting for my opponent to to put his cards on the table before devising a strategy now here's the thing we ask ourselves what the drawback of the move c3 is and what i'm seeing is that it weakens the d3 pawn but can we get to that pawn well that pawn is on a light square how can we deploy this bishop to aim ourselves at that point who can tell me very quickly before i make this move yeah b6 bishop a6 that's right okay knight g5 i guess he wants knight h3 i guess we can chase that knight away first let's get it out of there and then play bishop a6 now if he goes okay so he goes f3 what should we do now that this is already a very serious mistake he doesn't fully appreciate the idea of our previous move so we now have all of these sources of attack on the pawn so all we have to do no not c4 remember keep your eyes on the prize don't confuse uh exploiting weakness with elimination actually helps him d take c4 is the is the move this is a very instructive moment and now what should we take the pawn with the queen of the bishop and this is a good example of not falling for general principles but here prioritizing concreteness we take with the bishop uh because we pin his queen to his rook we win the exchange and upon our position is now winning but we need to play swiftly and precisely to not let him back into the game so we saw our plan worked like a charm bishop takes f1 now after king takes f1 here's what i see the knight is a type 2 undefended piece which means it's only defended by one other piece that's the bishop how can we use that factor to deploy and further activate some of our pieces so knight e5 would be the obvious move but what i like here is c4 in order to redeploy this bishop to c5 i think i've said deploy too many okay this guy has completely fallen to pieces uh has completely fallen no he he plays like it he's he's not like provisional or anything he actually does does uh keep his rating i don't know what what the deal is i think he just panicked okay so we're just going to trade bishops here we're going to complete our idea bishop c5 and now i'm going to do something kind of fancy which way would you guys take which just out of curiosity who thinks that they can decode what i want to do here okay guys we can move on from the fact that he's playing badly there's there's nothing i can do about it pawn to open up the b file love the mentality everybody is saying it now no problem how should we unpin ourselves rook edith c8 remember that the best way to solve a p pin is to defend the pinned piece with what i call the penny you know there's like the uh you in english you add the double e uh to refer to something that's on the receiving end of something so then the knight is the pinned piece and i found that there was no word for the rook so i've developed this word penny the work is the penny p i n e e p all right of course the penny is okay this is winning very exquisite yes exquisite the penny pasta yeah i'm gonna get the peanut paste and i'll see the that [Music] okay i think this man can resign this move had an idea what is the idea of this move who can tell me i didn't just play this move to screw around what was the idea of this move stop knight before so you can play c4 bingo excellent you guys are on top of things can we go rook c5 no because of 97 great count of course we can we're still completely winning but there is no need to give up and that's something i want to make very clear i see a lot of people getting in trouble because of this now even at a high level i sometimes see people go up a lot of material and then they'll just start arbitrarily giving up material to trade more pieces and that's fine we've done that many times i've emphasized the importance of that idea but you don't want to take it too far it's okay to give up a pawn uh if you're up a queen it's a give up an exchange if you're up a rook but only if it's necessary you don't want to do that if it's not strictly necessary because what often ends up happening is you're not left with that much extra material and you overestimate its value and i've seen people get in trouble because of that so um i just wanted to emphasize that point okay we can actually pre-move this he has no way to defend against the checkmate unless he gives me this check yeah oh my god i should have moved the rook it doesn't matter okay let's just prolongs the game yeah i'm sorry only because he's not resigning uh i have no problem with this but okay finally he resigns finally he resigns okay sorry that was the wrong game okay so what happens here now i've shown you guys why a move like bishop e7 is bad and i've even shown you guys the stem game where this was played and black got himself in very serious trouble to to remind you guys there was a very beautiful game played by t ground petrossian which served as kind of the classic illustration of why this particular structure is very bad now conceptually the reason it's bad is black white is this clamp on the d6 square why does this clamp on the d6 square and that clamp is actually quite a bit more unpleasant than it appears i froze my computer's frozen the game that really convinced people of how bad this type of thing is is petrosian against pacman that was a different opening but guess what black played here what move did black play here black castles and what did he allow who can tell me what move and castles was wrong black should have played d6 this will be familiar to us in a moment luneck bachmann was a gm but he allowed e5 he didn't understand why this was bad it is true that black breaks through the clamp with d6 but now black has all of these weaknesses that are remaining as a result of it petrosian goes after them and he won the game very easily and he wanted playing on these dark squares it's very important to recognize this if you're a sicilian player be very careful about allowing that that's why we played the move d6 okay so d6 bishop e7 castles castles and here d5 now i want to make it very clear that some people would not play a move like this because we've already played d6 and they wouldn't want to lose a tempo tempi are relative okay a tempo is not does not have intrinsic value um and because our opponent is playing so passively we can afford to spend another tempo on d5 you don't owe it to anybody to like try to be consistent in a certain way so c3 what is the drawback weakens the pawn how do we exploit it deploying our bishop to a6 and of course he played f3 now what should he have done here he probably should have played e5 honestly and and at least closed off the avenue to the pawn and here you know we have a lot of things we can do we can go b5 and and d4 or c4 i like black's position but it's it's obviously very much a game and of course after f3 he gives up everything here and now c4 right exploiting the type 2 undefended piece knight a5 would have been a little less effective because of bishop c2 so oh why rookie yeah yeah yeah i wrote this down i even wrote this down why did i play rookie 8 what is the psychology now let me explain this from two angles now first of all what does rookie a do what what exactly does this move accomplish well it accomplishes a couple of things right it x-rays the queen so if he ever takes you guys can see why the rook would be meaningful here in addition it creates the little f8 square for the bishop that could be very helpful in a variety of positions or even the night you know that could be helpful in a variety of positions and above all else i'm basically waiting for my opponent to show me how he's going to position his pieces this is what's called a healthy waiting move it's a useful waiting move but it still is kind of a waiting move and i didn't want to commit to a particular strategy for example if i'd gone b5 he had a nasty move a4 cutting into my my little pawn majority on the queen side so it's this sort of game of cat mouse where i'm almost waiting for him to commit to a plan so that i can choose a plan in accordance with that i think something like c4 was objectively probably strongest but i wanted to illustrate this concept to you guys what's an unhealthy weighting move h6 h6 would be an unhealthy waiting move because it would create a weakness on the king's side a hook that my opponent can then use it would in effect backfire by helping him make a plan b6 yeah b6 would be fine but i wouldn't really see a point in putting the bishop on a6 if this pawn weren't weak okay so yeah so e5 he could have done and that closes the position up but now black can try to attack on the queen side and i can position my bishop to f8 or even knight f8 knight g6 does that make sense to everybody so don't take this too far okay you should only do this if you're quite sure that you have the time for this you can afford it but i think this was a good time to illustrate the concept of a healthy waiting move let's continue you
