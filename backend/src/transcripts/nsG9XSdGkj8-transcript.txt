somebody like caruana does he have a coach yes he does he has several coaches these are people apart from this team of seconds who actually give him exercises and teach him and people don't understand that because how can carawanna's coach be 2600 right isn't he 200 points below caruana yes he is but at that level and at my level your coach doesn't actually have to be stronger than you if you're a 2500 gm you can understand the game at a very very deep level and you could still be a specialist in determining what fabi's mistakes are and what his weaknesses are and and using computers you could enhance that knowledge it's not all about how good you are you have to be a baseline level of good but after that it's all about understanding of the game i hope that makes a little bit of sense and clarifies [Music] things playing at 1200 and uh let's play another sicilian which we have been experimenting with now yesterday uh yep uh west26 i see your question i will be sure i've written it down and i will be sure to address it after the three games okay what did i tell you guys again uh bishop c4 is very popular at this level but the logic behind it is is that you play e6 and you blunt the bishop entirely it's just staring at granite and in addition to that you can play d5 with tempo so all of this is is really good now he plays the open sicilian so he has an element of correctness to his play but again look at this bishop it's just doing nothing it's it's an empty developing move and on top of that sometimes the bishop belongs on d3 he's giving us a beautiful pawn center and he actually is making a very typical mistake this move if you're playing the sicilian you have to sear this into your memory how do we refute the movie five those of you who've done some puzzle rush this morning should be able to spot this quite quickly yeah quinn a5 forks upon so whenever your opponent puts a pawn on an undefended square like this particularly when he hasn't castled okay and he's adding insult to injury because now we're attacking his king and we can also take on b2 this is turning into a disaster for white but one very important thing to point out when you're grabbing pawns like this you want to make extra certain that you're not abandoning your developments okay that's exactly how these short games are played is you start grabbing the pawns you fall in love with your position and you completely forget to continue and complete your development so let's actually do that and that's not a glamorous process completing your development is often a process that appears to be rather lame but but it's not thank you bandidad for the thousand bits how should we do that and this is a very important position actually so bishop b4 is good bishop b4 develops with tempo and if he goes rook b1 we can slide the queen back to a3 uh we do have to be careful about some tactics here where he takes on b4 and gives us a discovery against the queen but since he doesn't really have any pieces active uh we don't have to worry about this we'll we'll be able to deal with it but i'll show after the game some of the things that you have to be careful about when you uh enter into a situation like this if this makes sense uh thanks again banda dad another thousand bit bomb he goes rook b3 we're going to drop the queen back and another thing that we need to be careful about you see that the bishop is x-raying the queen this is the type of situation which you need to be super cautious about because it could result like i just said in a discovery discoveries are among the most scary and the most feared tactics on the chessboard and for very good reason uh and one way that he could effectuate a discovery is by playing a3 distracting our bishop and then removing the night somewhere the reason that this isn't as effective is because our position is super solid we don't have any targets in our position uh and and his pieces are too passive to support some sort of crazy discovery but this is an important position reishidan with 16 oh my lance an amazing mod and now gifting 16 more subs stokes the fire and i think we've reached 1900 we're at the 20th century where should we go with the bishop should we take another pawn why or why not and if not where should we go very important moments well when i ask the question like this most of you probably know that you should not take the pun because i asked we should drop it to e7 believe it or not if we take the pawn we actually lose a piece and here we go he discovers our queen but this is nothing to fear thank you american uh one eleven for the prime now you ruined the the round number and we're gonna drop the queen back to well actually let's see so he's attacking our queen we need to move it um where should we move it where it's not entirely backward but it's on a nice square where it's protected by a pawn shell let's get to c7 because we're also guarding the d4 the d6 square he can't get like a bishop to e6 i realize that this is uh the type of position we haven't really talked about yet very much and i'm going quickly through some of these details this is a very important moment if we move the rook he slams his bishop to d6 and he cuts the lifeline between our queen sign and our king side we want to be very careful about that situation so how should we prevent the bishop from getting to d6 while not giving up a rook bingo that's also why we put our queen on c7 i was going to mention this but instead we uh made it happen uh thank you again everybody wishing me happy birthday let's trade the bishops although we could have played c4 and uh let's just grab some of the center no rocket science here we're up two pawns he's got no compensation uh and now all we need to do is complete our developments and continue expanding in the center and we'll be in very very good shape how are we going to do that specifically well that depends on how he plays kind of a cute move here would be queen d4 from his side trying to get his rook to the seventh rank in trading queens in that case okay he's on rook b3 play has gotten much tighter but i'm trying to illustrate that the principles i abide by are not fundamentally different from those i started with where should we plant this bishop and with what idea should we do that where should we land where should we oh my lands this bishop so so there's really two candidates there's bishop d7 but there's also bishop b7 we're gonna go bishop b7 and a lot of people i know are wait a second aren't you isn't the bishop staring at the pawn well it is but what i'm thinking is that later on i'm gonna go d4 i'm gonna open up the bishop right and that bishop is gonna be breathing we can't do that immediately because the bishop's gonna hang so let's reposition the bishop on a defended square so that we could go d4 is a trade good for us here it certainly is we're up two puns we don't mind a trade of bishops uh we certainly don't mind an end game there is one thing that i want to get done here you see that his rook is on the b file i don't like the fact that he's got control of the b file how can we prevent him from bringing that under full control what should we kind of do uh before we do anything else and there's two things that need to be done in a position like this the first is to go rook ba what is the second sort of russian school of chess take care of your future self kind of move and first we're gonna go t4 and take the bishop but in general in such positions it's a good idea to do what just to make sure that nothing goes terribly wrong in the future we take the opportunity to make some luft very good and we are going to make some luff by playing g6 why am i not playing h6 because the queen is guarding that's h7 square and now we're going to continue to expand in the center so for that reason i think g7 is a more uh you know is a more sensible square to open up and now what should we do what should we do in this position how do we respond to the tension that he has created a very very natural move we should definitely push and create two connected passers and let's push it even further and now we open up a queen so dark salvation 87 thanks for subbing with the prime again i know that i'm not explaining everything at the granular level that i was earlier but play has gotten tighter and i warned you about this uh for that reason i will be a little bit deeper after the game what should we do fork d3 that's why we put our queen on d6 he's lost he's busted he's got to lose one of these two pieces and the game is over okay we have a very cute move here a lot of people would reject d take c2 because our queen is hanging but let's look a little bit deeper than that we can actually still take for the reason that uh we will be able to promote with check and i'm trying to find a more beautiful win there but no this is good enough we're gonna promote with check and we're gonna be up a rook now let's just get the queen to d2 threatening the ladder checkmate okay one check and it's gonna be made on the next move because uh yeah very good okay so uh one more game and let's now switch to two games at a time because the games have gotten a little bit more complex there's a lot to talk about and i have a lot of stuff to lay out for you guys so so that the next set of games are going to be a little bit more understandable so let's play one more game and then we're going to talk about them okay uh slash nine and let's go e4 no i'm playing random people in the pool and here we see a sicilian i think for the very first time and uh i'm gonna play the open sicilian which is good night butter thank you so much for the for the support and and just just an honor so have a great night okay so he already has made a mistake the move d6 is not how you play the sicilian you want to take d4 instead why is d6 a mistake why does this allow what does this allow us to do um it's it's a weird move it allows us to expand in the center and kick his knight away and now he is nowhere good to put the knight if he puts his puts it on e5 he ruins his pawn structure very early if he well and he does and we're going to take it now a lot of people would play knight c3 i think that's a positional mistake when the position is transformed in a way like this we want to ask ourselves we want to develop more purposefully and this pawn on e5 is weak how can we use this knight in order to attack the pawn where should we put it a lot of people want to play the move c4 but i actually think that's not the best thing we can do let's reserve that square for what let's reserve that square for the knight either knight t2 f3 or knight t2 c4 i would prefer to put the knight on c4 because if we put the knight on f3 he could pin us with a bishop on the other hand that would leave open the possibility of giving a check but all of that is a moot point because right now he is attacking the e41 how should we continue how should we continue in order to reinforce the idea of of bringing the knight to c4 or f3 this is what i mean with purposeful development we're at a level now where we can't just develop our pieces to the same squares every game let's support the pawn with c4 which basically means that yes we're gonna have to put the knight to f3 our development has to react more dynamically to the to the necessities of the position thank you to you thank you nemo uh for the birthday wishes and we will do something very soon uh and uh just an honor to have done so many call-ups with you thank you nemo for the six months okay so he's castled what do we do what do we do we can grab the pawn yeah let's grab the pawn i would personally have castled first and i will explain why after the game i will explain why after the game this is a little bit iffy because okay knight d7 is not the best thing to do now we have a choice between trading or dropping the knight back let's actually drop the knight back and the reason why is because in addition to a space sorry in addition to being an extra pawn to having an extra pawn we have a space advantage and when you have a space advantage you generally want to keep more pieces on the board there's no reason to lighten the load for him by trading the knights this knight on f3 is very nice because it's it's pressuring e5 and it's tying down his knight to e5 by tying down his knight we're also not allowing him to develop his bishop he's made a good move here to untie his knight but there's many ways to play here there's many possible plans uh one plan is to start expanding on the queen side and how should we first let's play h3 before we do anything else let's play h3 to stop ideas of bishop g4 the way that you would expand on the queen side is by preparing the b4 pawn push how should we prepare that pawn push what should we do in order to prepare the b4 pawn push let's go a3 we're at a level guys where the plans that we execute are no longer one move plans okay they take two or three moves and that's okay that's just part of getting better at chess okay so he wants to sack on h3 which is actually not a dangerous idea but i want to show you guys the power of prophylax well actually no this is such an empty idea that we don't even really have to do anything about it okay let's go now rook c1 to x-ray his queen we've gone before we've introduced an another source of pressure and he has sacrificed his bishop a lot of people would be scared by this sacrifice why am i not scared and what do we want to do about this well actually this is not a bad idea but in order to defend against it we have to create an escape route for our king and we have to realize that he really doesn't have any threats other than to give us a check on g4 the way that we will deal remember if we move the knight away then we would give up this bishop so let's go rookie one for two reasons the first is that we open up an escape route for the king to the center king is usually safer in the center in these kinds of positions because the center is closed the second thing we're preparing to do is bishop f1 bishop g2 knight chief iv does not prepare for mate that's what people would think and that's what scares people but he's not actually threatening checkmate this knight on f3 is guarding h2 at this level the margins of victory are much narrower that's just the reality and i mentioned this yesterday you can't be afraid of phantom threats you have to determine whether or not he's actually threatening anything if the answer is no then the answer is no again this guy is playing extremely well for his level extremely well and i would be very impressed if he would play a five here which he does now we're going to bring the rook into the game to reinforce the knight and and we just have a lot of beef here on the king's side he doesn't have enough pieces with which to truly attack again i am very impressed with how he's able to play this now what should we do in order to bring this rook over to h3 what do we have to do what do we have to do we have to move the knight away the reason most people would not move the knight is because they would be scared of the check on h2 but guess what why would we why did we move the rook to e1 we move the rook d1 precisely to take the sting out of the check on h2 we simply slide the king and now we get the rook to h3 get out of here not only does the queen have to move away from h5 but in addition to that his position just begins to collapse because once the queen moves away he exposes the h7 pawn we can take that pawn and then we can come back to g5 we have our own h file that's open now i don't care about winning a pawn here i care about opening that h file so that we can actually start to attack ourselves let's get the knight back and now the time has come to open up the board his position is sufficiently weakened to where we can afford to open up the f file uh and and our pieces stream in and just deliver checkmate in many different ways yeah this is um this guy is very good but he started to collapse what do we do rook takes f5 how do we continue we take tonight we simply take the night now we're up two pieces his attack is evaporated and as often happens phil jackson legendary coach of the la lakers he made this point in basketball that if you shoot a three-pointer from the corner and it's missed it often results in a dunk at the other end of the board at the other end of the court uh and i won't go into the details of that it's actually a fantastic point and i'm a big basketball fan so i find that to be a very instructive point but it's a similar thing in chess right when you do one of these attacks and it backfires an attack by the opponent often results in an attack by the opposing side when it fails because of the sacrifices literally and figuratively that you make uh when and of course of the bulls of the sacrifices that you make when you're attacking you open up your own king you do all this stuff like player 5 when the attack backfires one of the silver linings at the end of the road is that you can turn that attack around and attack your opponents thanks again for the incredible support today we're going to go back to e5 here and try to work a little bit more on mastering these basics now he goes for their eye lopez we have faced this exactly once and we go a6 people probably already know that bishop takes c6 leads to the exchange variation he's playing the main line of the red lopez white is usually supposed to castle he goes d3 which is a very solid and very sensible sideline now we're going to go b5 to get rid of the tension on that knight here we can either develop our bishop to e7 which is the more solid move but we're going to develop it to c5 that is the more ambitious line but you guys know me i like the ambitious options and we're going to cement that bishop by playing d6 okay so he's actually playing this well nothing crazy and i mentioned earlier the similarity between the rai lopez and the italian well here you see it right this is a very similar position to what happens in the italian now do we take the pawn here do we take on d4 or do we drop our bishop directly what do you guys think okay people are saying take i'm not sure why why can somebody explain the case for taking what is the case for taking on d4 no we don't we actually don't take uh and and the short reason and i will explain this after the game short reason behind not taking uh is is what our opponent did a couple games ago right you yields better control of the center for white that e4 pawn is operating uncontested if we take on d4 part of the reason e4e5 has withstood the test of time is because fundamentally if you think about it in a very granular level you are occupying the same amount of center that white is and and giving away that center is something that needs to be done very very carefully in addition you open an avenue down the c file and i'll talk about that later so i talked about one of white's main ideas in the italian black has exactly the same idea what am i talking about what should we do next what should we do next and the is thinking in the right direction we should definitely think about starting an attack on the king's side but the reality is the center being closed is a blessing in disguise and the reason why is if you look at this bishop it's just staring at the pawn if we go c6 we do him a solid by opening up the bishop and it will once again begin operating at its full potential the move d5 that he has made is actually very premature because it's opened up our bishop and it's closed off his this knight can go to f4 but let's not go there immediately let's be patient in order to attack on the king side we do need to open something up but what exactly is it and how are we going to open up that king side to get more of our pieces involved let's think about it that way maybe somebody can just name the idea we want to push the f on two squares in order to push the f on two squares we want to do it very carefully the move knight h5 is the typical way of repairing f5 there's a small tactic with knight takes c5 okay so he's gone h3 which is usually a very bad move in these positions because he's actually weakening his position even more and the reality is uh we don't even need to play f5 i think we can get away with not doing it at all uh because of the move h3 he's created a hook on which we can as we already know sacrifice our bishop and the reason i put this knight on f4 and not the others because now we can still play f5 at our leisure when the time and the conditions are right but maybe we can just get away with not doing it at all in fact we're sort of eyeing the sacrifice on h3 as a potential way to rip apart his king side we'll see what he does uh this depends entirely on how he chooses to defend but the move h3 and this is something you can apply in terms of defending you want to be super careful about these kinds of moves that voluntarily make weaknesses near the king let's go let's take it but then the follow-up move is going to be a very important one once he takes on h3 we don't actually want to take back with the knight we want to include more beef in the attack what does that mean what move should we play after he takes on h3 yes queen d7 is correct we want to recapture with the queen and that is a crucial cog in the machine here if we just take on h3 greedily we might end up with not enough pieces in the attack we've already seen this idea before very similarly at least uh in in one of our white games that's the magic of chess you can borrow ideas across openings across colors uh and across uh opponents and tournaments and all of that stuff that's why it's so important to analyze your own games partially because not only do you figure out your weaknesses but in addition to that you also uh you know you get so much better at understanding uh ideas and your your database of understanding grows wider and wider now he's made a very good move here and actually was hoping he would make it because this shows us why we got to be very careful about sacrifices like these and why sometimes that is unnecessary he has found the correct defense bringing his queen in i anticipated this trust me on this and this is the moment when a lot of people would panic and they would say damn you know the attack didn't work we're lost we didn't check made him on g2 guess what we have two puns for the piece we still have a beautiful knight we still have the possibility of organizing an attack and i want to make it very clear that when something fails in chess when you find like you want to attack you feel like you're on the cusp of delivering mate and then something happens it goes wrong and your our opponent finds a defense you want to be very calm and you want to be very realistic about understanding exactly how bad the situation is and the situation here is not that bad we still have some pawns for the piece and we still have a huge attack we just got to bring more pieces in that's all we have to do and now we're going to play a five to sacrifice upon and we're just gonna try to open some more stuff up here some more files some more avenues for our pieces uh he goes 92 okay so he's actually once again playing very very very well and surprisingly but he's allowing me now to open up that f-file uh and now that pawn on f2 is gonna get caught in the crossfire and predictably he makes a big blunder he doesn't realize the significance of that pawn of that file being open we see first of all the x-ray between the rook and the queen which immediately leads us to the question can we move our knight away and win the queen we can knight h3 is this square defended it absolutely is by our queen that we slid to h6 how did i find this move well i remember yes or sarah wants comment right the queen is often best in a supporting actress role it can be just as effective from behind as it can be from the front we have one a queen we still keep all of our attack going strong and the game should end very very soon okay so he now blunders f2 and the position collapses okay boom boom and he's just going to lose all of his pieces so we can play this relatively fast a very good defensive job by our opponent here who found that idea of bringing the queen uh into the defense so kudos kudos to my opponent for for awesome plane okay and he resigns let's analyze and then we'll wrap up for today okay so uh just to recap a couple of key moments early in the game the reason that we don't take is that we give him amazing control of the center and how is that control manifested well he's threatening e5 and that move will exploit the pin that he has just orchestrated remember that in such positions the move g5 is going to be very dangerous by definition because of the possibility of that sacrifice so so this lands us in completely unnecessary trouble particularly since we can simply drop the bishop back and if we count the defenders and the attackers we've got two defenders on e5 two attackers which means this is perfectly safe and yes you can trade queens and at this higher level you have to open yourself up to the possibility that you will have end games uh and that's not something that you can entirely avoid in all variations that's a foolish way to be the move d5 is very tempting but it's a mistake thank you cami this is a mistake because he blocks his own bishop as i talked about and he actually helps us improve our own knights my knight wants to be on g6 and he's basically helping us get there anyway uh and here we go knight h5 to prepare f5 and to get our knight to f4 now if i were playing black okay and and this was a classical game i would not sack on h3 what instead would i do what would black do and you already know that this is the idea but this would be probably the best move the black has f5 definitely f5 to open more stuff up but let's say that you wanted to prepare bishop takes h3 can somebody find a very sneaky three move idea that actually prepares bishop takes h3 and it would be a little bit of a stubborn idea i don't love it but just to give you guys some practice thinking about plans and maneuvers how would you prepare yep very nice potato for president bishop d7 queen c8 building a little battery and then we could take on h3 the problem with that idea is that it's a little bit too slow and it gives white a chance to bring in some defenders one thing he could do is he could drop his knight back to g1 and beef up the security on that pawn but we could play f5 here now that we've sort of compromised white's defensive position but that would all be too complicated i would just play a 5. so our opponents actually did find and we got a donation oh we got another hundred bucks from vp bombazi uh another incredibly generous supporter of my stream for so long thank you vp you're the best and another 100 bucks dropped on me this is unbelievable support today it's raining raining from the sky and uh uh this is awesome this is this is awesome thank you vp so much for your long-term support this is not the only hundred dollar donation he's made uh so thank you so much appreciate him hi man okay um so how yeah very well-deserved vip now if we did play f5 uh we got a question about how we would continue this attack well there would be several ways to do that and this would depend almost entirely this would depend almost entirely on on what white does thank you ultier for the tier one man this never ends uh one way would be to pile up on that file perhaps build an alekhine's gun uh knight takes g2 would be on the cards at some point in order to isolate that knight on f3 if he moves his knight away then we bring our queen to the square that has now been freed up by the knight i want to emphasize that there is no single monolithic way to attack okay thank you for the converting sub pinky cliffy diffie we've got the fireworks going strong again um and here we go now there is no one way to attack our attack must depend on three primary things okay uh and and if people are interested in truly improving you can write this stuff down i think it helped me i owed this to some of my coaches who helped me understand this thank you women's gm adriana an honor to have you in my stream as well thank you for the sub one of them is pieces an attack has to have pieces involved okay it's very hard to attack with a single piece the second thing is weaknesses eventually you're gonna have to create weaknesses near your opponent's king that have to be used in a strategic way uh either weaknesses that you can checkmate on or weak pieces or weak pawns right and the third thing and this is what people forget about is reaction right you want to react properly to your opponent's defensive moves and when you're attacking you want to ask yourself what is the drawback of my opponent's move what squares does it now leave open where which i could use for my pieces a great example of this would be if he moves his knight back from e1 maybe it's no longer as effective to get to the file but now we have the g file so so these three things when properly combined can give you a lot of attacking ability anyways i don't want to belabor the point here thank you rad broga for the hundred bits uh we had several questions what about e4 e4 would be a great idea get that knight out of there and then go queen shoot for perfect absolutely uh i would be a little bit hesitant about e4 because it would leave this night undefended by a pawn and i like my pieces to be defended by puns but but that would be certainly something to consider um now our opponents actually found a very nice defensive idea queen f3 and instead of panicking we just drop our queen back and we're saying okay this knight is still very strong now we're going f5 to open more pieces up open more files up what would have happened if he takes on e5 how would we continue attacking here well there's several ways to do it we could bring our rook to e8 and prepare e4 and open even more files up and try to overextend some of his pieces and one other very important thing and this is truly high level stuff right this is for the higher rated people but everybody is welcome to take a crack at it you're attacking one of the things that people forget most often is that they get and this is a way of sort of showing tunnel vision this is this is a form of tunnel vision when people attack they get too fixated on checkmate they forget that one of the byproducts of a weak king is that you can use that weak king as a springboard to to also win material winning material is a very natural conclusion to a lot of attacks it's not only about checkmate the weak king is not a liability only because it can get checkmated but also because you can use it to deliver checks as a way of actively transferring your pieces to squares where they can deliver forks and pins and skewers and that is exactly what plaque can do here to win back the piece let's find the sequence let's find the sequence knight h3 and knight g5 bingo and everybody sees it this is awesome awesome to see pin oh sorry fork attacking the queen attacking the bishop and the game is over uh because once we take the bishop material equality has been responded guess what our rook is going to lift itself over to h4 just wanted to share that piece of advice we're going to expand upon this in in great detail once we get you know a little bit up there but but the concept of winning material when you're attacking is oftentimes uh missed by a lot of people again this might seem a little bit you know vague but i promise that we will build on this advice as we go along okay so he went 92 we opened up the file he should have taken with the queen here what would we have done had he taken with the queen thank you and let's not forget whose idea this whole speed run was what would have happened had he taken on e3 no this is not 2 000 plus stuff it's stuff that is applicable by anybody but how should i put this i would say that there is bigger fish to fry when you're 1200 than to try to like actively apply this advice uh but but but that doesn't mean you can't do it and and i wanted to yeah absolutely robert i'm gonna keep a close eye on your answer though yeah i don't think hess can get this he's he's i i don't think he's known for his tactics i don't know why anybody would commentate with someone like that really do you guys have any idea who would ever commentate with someone like that queen g oh yes chuck mccheck and checkmate amazing job bye grandmaster has yeah so knight h3 and the knight takes f2 and now his king is entirely exposed and queen h3 is is gonna be crushing so this would have been the results of taking with the queen but here of course we win the queen um here of course we win the queen so oh right queen takes c4 and 92 oh he was oh actually we're serious so knight takes e2 and you go into the end game see i couldn't tell actually this is a very nice idea queen g6 check man this guy actually knows what he's talking about who is this guy i've never seen him before um this uh this is quite the surprise uh hes seeing some tactics come on come on man yeah this is very nice so here we win back the piece and we go into an end game up i think three puns uh now knight h3 knight f2 is also of course crushing because of this but white can get into the end game uh also down a bunch of pawns so this would be also very nice very nice idea queen 26 thank you so sillam rm for the tier one he's almost playing like a gm but he took with the bishop and made our job very easy goodnight h3 just uh winning the queen and uh the rest was very easy and that's what often happens you lose one piece and and everything collapses the move c takes d4 is is the main move and this leads to the openstacilian black has black has many variations here yesterday i played the accelerated dragon there's also the sveshnikov or black play z5 there's the rouser and all of these are full-fledged position full-fledged sicilian lines they all have their own pluses and minuses thank you son of zoo for the twitch prime um and let me re-enable the alert box uh now he played d6 which delays the capture and allows us uh the possibility to play d5 and kick the knight away he goes 95 we take the knight and this is where i introduce the concept of purposeful developments the structures that you get at a higher level are going to be a little bit more unusual you're not going to get the same openings every time because people play different stuff and you've got to be able to dynamically adjust your play and your development particularly particularly your development to exactly what it is your opponent is doing don't just generically play knight c3 because that's where you usually put the knight try to approach the situation concretely and logically okay the pawn on e5 is weak it's doubled it's hard to defend how what is a good piece that acts kind of like a screwdriver that acts like a chisel okay it's the knight where can we put the knight to attack the pawn we can put it on c4 f3 but daniel doesn't doesn't this take two moves okay didn't you say you should only develop each piece once right that's the basic principle but the higher level you get as i've said the more principles that you violate strategically because he himself has not developed any pieces we can actually afford to burn another tempo and put the knight on a better square okay so bishop d3 now we go c4 we don't want to give up this pawn this pawn is the reason why we're better right it's a bone in his throat we go c4 and we eliminate that square from the knight but remember we still have the f3 square knight f3 knight takes c5 we just snag upon go back to f3 we don't want to trade knights for no reason okay so here we go h3 we prepared before everything here is very simple and this is the moment i wanted to focus on um oh jeremy why would i castle instead of snagging the pawn so basically if we snagged the pawn i was a little bit concerned that he would start bothering me down the e-file and i thought that if we castle uh maybe that's just a little bit safer we don't really actually need this pawn for our advantage but now that i look at it i think taking the pawn was a good idea i i don't agree with with what i said earlier i don't think that would have been dangerous uh so i prepared before here which is a very typical plan in such positions i'm trying to set my pawn advantage in motion and for that to happen i'm going to have to get rid of one of his pawns getting rid of his other pawn is going to be very hard because it's easy to defend with the rook and so for that reason i'm trying to get rid of this one okay let's say that you saw this move and you said all right you know what i know that this attack isn't dangerous but i'm going to defend against it anyway how would we go about preventing bishop takes h3 if we happen to be afraid of it if we have if he happened to be afraid of it we would go king h2 all right and the king would lend support to this pawn if he takes we simply take back and he simply has no follow-up the move g4 i would caution you against that is a knee-jerk response be careful so that the medicine isn't worse than the disease here he can take on g4 and the attack is actually much stronger than it would have been if he takes on h3 right he gets a tempo with chuck uh the reason that i didn't play king h2 and this is a very advanced thing so i know that there are higher rated among you and um you know i i i haven't forgotten about you guys why did i not play king h2 uh there is a specific reason and then there is a conceptual reason there is something i didn't like about the placement of this king which is why i didn't do this i almost did can somebody name either of these reasons specific and conceptual yes so the bishop on d6 is is x-raying the king i hate putting my king in one of these situations when it gets x-rayed uh and you might look at this and say well i don't care about the x-ray he's got a pawn on e5 what does it matter uh this is completely blocking in the bishop and so is this well that's where tactics come in tactics are a way of making stuff happen that might seem impossible and can somebody find a tactic to try to open this bishop up what what can black try to do uh to get this pawn moving and deliver that discover check you can sack on e4 remove the pawn now he can remove the bishop and guess what he goes e4 now yes this is not a disaster for white you can just move the king and at the end of the day you're still a pawn but i'm not trying to be that specific i'm just trying to show you guys some of the conceptual reasons that go behind my intuition that's why i was a little bit reticent about king h2 another thing i could have done here is gone rookie one this is a very high level deep move rookie one is a great example of indirect prophylaxis direct prophylaxis would be king h2 this means literally stopping your opponent's threat indirect prophylaxis is a way of allowing your opponent to do what he wants to do but taking the sting out of it entirely how do we take the sting out of bishop takes h3 with the mover q1 well i actually played this move in the game so you guys know what the idea is what would i do now to fully throw water onto the fire and extinguish the attack entirely now we would go bishop f1 so this move in and of itself is a little bit awkward right the rook gets onto a closed file but the point is not to improve the rook's position the point is to involve the bishop in the defense and if he doesn't take on h3 we can shut down this idea permanently by playing bishop f1 i think that this would have actually been even better than what i did right i played rook c1 here to get the rook onto a file where it x-rays the queen but i i should have probably gone rookie one just to operate with a higher margin of safety now this is important because h2 is covered some people were very afraid of this but if you look specifically at the squares then you can see that that there really isn't any uh threats here and an attack is is a function of the weakness of the king and the number of pieces that participate in that attack uh and and if not that many pieces are participating in the attack then there's no magic here it's going to be very hard to make stuff happen particularly because we've involved one two three defenders in the attack uh and here comes a fourth defender and at this point we locked the attack down completely by the way just to mention after sorry for the jumping around uh if we if he played queen h2 check after knight g5 then we just drop our king away and this is why the bishop is so good because it guards h1 and it guards all of these squares and it also supports rook h3 which by the way would have trapped the queen so you know attack is a very double-sided thing it's not that your opponent is only having all the fun all right that was uh that was a mouthful but hopefully this makes uh some sense to people how do i see this well i can recommend to some of the higher rateds among you there is a very good chess book called secrets of chess defense by one of my favorite uh romanian grandmasters miguel maher and he's an amazing instructor i wrote his name in the chat he wrote several amazing books i can highly recommend secrets of chess defense i can also recommend looking at the games of tigrand petrossian particularly the book python strategy petrosian and i've talked about that before has this reputation as as a boring player very positional makes a lot of draws but guess what if you if you want to get better at chess you have to master the skills that are not as glamorous as attacking and sacrificing and one of those skills is prophylaxis and defending on a larger scale and one of the best ways of learning how to do stuff is to watch people who do it a lot better than you do and i apply that constantly and it's responsible for a lot of my growth and improvement as a player and i think as a coach as well there's a lot of coaches i think who are more experienced than me and better than me uh and uh i look up to them one of them is miguel marin and you can learn from them and the same goes for specific chess improvement uh and and these books are i would say a little bit higher level if you're a beginner i would say that you should focus more on tactics calculation recognizing basic patterns and once you get 1300 or so then you can consider incorporating other types of training such as prophylaxis and defense uh okay and i wouldn't say under 2000 it's not necessary if you're talking about the book do you have to trust your opponent hasn't calculated an attack yeah you should never trust your opponent you should always assume uh that your opponent might have blundered something that that doesn't mean you shouldn't disrespect your opponent you should assume that your opponent has something up his sleeve but at the same time you shouldn't take your opponent's word on anything and that includes sacrifices and attacks and all that jazz uh because people are capable of not only bluffing but honest mistakes your opponent may have thought that that the attack works but he might have just missed uh he might have just missed uh you know some sort of specifics within the attack some sort of option there and you should always open your mind up to that okay um let us analyze recognizing your opponent's resources by veretsky i have that book i wouldn't recommend it to anybody under 2100 honestly i think there are better resources for people in like the 16 1700 range now let's get to the first game that i played in this series in which he played bishop c4 this was a pretty one-sided game uh because he blundered upon by playing e5 and once i took this pawn and the other pawn the one important point that i wanted to make is that these situations have to cause you know you have to be cautious in them right because he's got the possibility for a discovery if the king was on e7 he would have been able to win the queen whenever a discovery is in the air you should make sure that you know there's no sudden night move that that causes a lot of trouble and looking at this i actually see that i did indeed miss the move knight b5 uh this move would have threatened knight c7 and attacked my queen and there's no way to move the queen away and also defend against knight c7 so believe it or not this actually would have been very strong now i don't think black is worse here i could have sacked the queen and i have a lot of stuff for the queen i have a rook and a piece and two pawns but the reality is uh white's probably the one calling the shots here so for that reason if i were playing a classical game i would have just gotten my queen back that is the first order of priority you guys already know from many of our discussions that the queen is one of the biggest liabilities in the opening when the queen is out here alone with no support from any of its pieces uh it it can turn into a huge liability because of the necessity to respond to all the threats and so oftentimes evacuating the queen becomes the first priority and that's that's what should have been done queen b6 uh okay so after he missed this opportunity i think things stabilized in quite a big way and this is a good example of a situation in which he's got no good discovery if he goes knight d5 i just take the knight with the queen he moved his knight away and moved the queen away and the rest is very straightforward just occupying the center developing the bishop to its best square and doing so with an eye toward the future we're not just willy-nilly putting it on any square we're putting it on a square so that once we open the diagonal the bishop is going to be doing the most that it can okay and the rest was very straightforward we take the b file away from him we make some luft we make some air for our king and and the word luft by the way means i think literally air in german uh and that's how we refer to moves like g6 which create a little bit of a hole for the king in order to avoid future back rank checkmates
