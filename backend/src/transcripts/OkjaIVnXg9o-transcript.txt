this will be on youtube yes all of the speed runs will be on youtube but i'm releasing them slowly to give people a chance to watch okay so again we see a perk and i really met the perk in a disreport i didn't know that the the this many 1600s played the perk and um okay let's go with the austrian so jose wanted me to play an austrian attack which is f4 where you arrange thank you cj hamster where you arrange these three pawns like this and basically the austrian the austrian attack builds it builds a big center and and what you're not trying to do here with white is you're not trying to attack on the king's side yet you're you're banking on the center and you need to develop your pieces with an eye toward toward supporting the center as much as possible so that you don't overextend yourself so that you don't bite off more than he you can chew and so the move bishop c4 would be a mistake here uh and a very instructor and fall into a tactic that we've talked about several times uh which is knight takes e4 and d5 i'll show that after the game so we actually want to put the bishop on d3 i know some of you might be looking at this and say what is the bishop doing uh but again not every one of your pieces needs to be you know ascending mount everest at every moment it can just be lending some support to the center and guess what because we've positioned our pieces in a healthy way we can expand uh even further let's go e5 let's expand a little bit further because that's the point which which pawn should we take with this is actually an instructor which font do you guys think and we can take with either pawn but this is actually a very interesting moment yeah so so okay so this is really interesting we can take with the f-bomb right and and the argument for that move would be that we open up the bishop and if we open up the bishop that means we can try to quickly run our h-bond out up the board and checkmate him and we're going to try to do that just for fun but if you want to know what i would have done in a real game i would have taken with the d-pawn and after the game i will explain exactly why so you guys have something to look forward to so here goes knight g4 okay uh let's let's let's get it get rid of it get out get out get out i don't want you there and let's get our bishop out of course gotta get our bishop out and look look where i'm putting it i'm putting it on a square such that it over protects the pawn and this move is part of the reason why i would have taken to the d-pad but in this position it's not good or it's not as effective because this is why i put the bishop here what can we now do how do we react to our opponent's attempt to break up our pawn structure the principles to capture toward the center but it has a lot of extent well no if we disregard it then he can take our pawn and attack the knight so we can just push uh if we go queen d2 then he can take our pawn on d4 break up our pawn chain and if we take his knight then he takes hours thank you for tuning chess coach for the raid of the party 19 appreciate it okay queen b6 uh so he attacks the pawn but um this one we can disregard because our control over the center is so overwhelming that we can just accumulate the pressure and we can do that with queen d2 we attack the knight and if he takes on b2 then he's probably going to end up losing a piece and if he does that i'll show you guys how uh but uh yep so first things first he's attacking our rook so we cannot take the knight yet he's gonna take our rook with chair we gotta move our rook first now queen yeah why not now what should we do now and this is the key move uh because if we take our the knight on h6 then he's gonna take back we take and he takes on c3 with check so we gotta ask ourselves the logical next question which is can we preemptively defend the knight somehow preferably with tempo so that his knight doesn't escape our clutches and the move rook b3 presents itself the queen has to go back and now we have our loot we have our knight and uh we're up a piece and the rook nicely defends the knight on c3 he's got no fork because that bishop guards the square and uh okay so he goes 1995. um we have a choice of several good moves here we can we can transition into winning a rook that would leave him with us yeah let's do it that would leave him with a strong bishop right it would leave him with a strong uncontested bishop but we are up a rook that's that's a huge material advantage and also remember that we can just castle short so we can we can escape the immediate danger to our king by castling short and uh well actually if he takes back he might give us a check on g3 i think he probably will my guess is he's gonna yeah which is so which is completely innocuous by the way and actually not a good move because the bishop isn't doing anything here and we can use it as a well kind of as a pawn now how should we go about winning this position well what jumps to mind is the fact that our king is is quite clearly in a little bit of a tough spot right it's not very safe so the thing that we really want to do is trade queens and for that to happen you might notice that the queens are making contact with each other through the lens of this knight through the x-ray of the knight where can yeah knight e4 we can move the knight to e4 which accomplishes two things notice now that he put his bishop on g3 and that's exactly why it's wrong because in addition to dealing with the the tension between the queens he has to also defend the bishop so he basically has to either well he basically has to preempt bishop takes e4 he basically has to either trade queens disaster because we're up a rook or he's got to drop his queen to c7 which allows me to root out this bishop and you know that's a another disastrous trait so that's it we we trades queens and we're up a rook okay now let's operate step by step first of all well first of all let's improve our bishop and let's get this bishop out of the picture then we're going to bring our king up okay well yeah he gives us the bishop but but if he moved the bishop we would have brought our king up activated the rook cemented our central control with c4 and won the game after that okay so well it's not that he had well by the way if he goes bishop c7 white wins on the spot here with what move what what does white do here yeah full board awareness is super important like understanding that and i blundered a piece like this so you know if you guys think that i'm like this immune to these kinds of blunders i'm not i once wandered a bishop in exactly this kind of way where i didn't realize the rook on one side of the board controls the square on the other side of the board um and you're like daniel i call bs on this okay i've actually shown this game excerpt once before a couple of months ago but i can show it again this is one of the only times where i actually full on blunder to piece in a tournament game my rating was 2076 this was 2006. and uh you'll see exactly what i mean this is actually i think quite an instructive example and uh there's a quick story that goes i've told this story before but um well stories aren't meant to be repeated just give me a second i'm setting up the scene a little bit here thank you uh lmao nice for the sub appreciate it there we go okay so yeah so there we go yeah i'll show everything don't worry all right um so this position occurred now this tournament was not actually san francisco let me change that this was in los this was in los angeles this was in los angeles yeah this was in los angeles so i had the white pieces it's just a position doesn't matter i i was um i had just turned 11 uh 13 days prior and uh you know we have a complicated position he's got a good night he's got bad pawn structure uh and i've got some pressure going down the a7 pawn and can somebody guess what move i played here with with white could somebody guess what move i played here yeah bishop takes a7 so i thought okay i thought okay uh he wants to take the spawn so let me take his pawn and he'll take mine and then i'll get my bishop back and great i'll eventually get control of the a file maybe the bishop will come back to d6 so i play bishop take say some my opponent kind of looks at me weirdly and i'm like okay maybe he's surprised i didn't play rook a1 but rookie one may be queen take c3 i think i didn't like this uh and and then he writes down and this was back when people used to write moves on the scoresheet before playing them i think that's kind of against the rules now or at least it's discouraged and he writes down rook takes a sun i'm like rook takes a so and i started thinking okay so he wants to sack the exchange and and he's going to try to checkmate me on g2 but he's i mean what the hell is this i mean because i now have a past pawn and then i look a little bit further and it's like rook g takes a7 i'm like oh my god he had a rook there and this is exactly the type of blunder my opponent made right full board awareness lack of full board awareness but here's the funny thing i actually made a draw i'm literally a piece down for no compensation but i actually made a draw which is the most nerdisky thing ever he even forced a queen trait i have no idea how i drew this position well i do i do actually he sacrificed the knight for no reason he played perfectly but then he he sacks a knight in a completely winning position thinking that he promotes a pawn but he doesn't and i managed to hold the position so anyways i managed to hold the position but but the fact remains i i i wanted a piece in one move like this okay back to the speed one sorry for the detour all right so yeah so who didn't see the rook and that's kind of what what our opponent is here it's very common so let's go go through the game this is another very instructive game we played the austrian attack the austrian attack is frequently considered and the funny thing is in the game that i just showed you it started with e4d6 that's a funny coincidence the austrian was first played in the year 1850 by john cochran john cochran was also the first person to play some other opening we were discussing like a day ago he was a british player very very strong uh and and he knew this guy knew what he was doing and it was played throughout the 1800s but just a couple times and then it really gained steam about 50 years ago but nobody really played the perk in the 1800s because people didn't give up control of the center like this right it was laughed at uh and the idea is just to get big control of the center and now you want to defend the pawn bishop c4 by the way uh there's knight takes e4 and d5 breaking into white center and and it's just bad uh we've discussed this before this this happens in a lot of different openings and that's why we play bishop d3 and we go e5 and this is the critical moment oh yeah johnny cochran right um yeah i just watched people against soj actually so why d take c5 right and people are looking at this move thinking like this violates all the rules you're not taking toward the center and you're keeping the bishop kind of closed so let me try to explain and the way that i'm going to explain this is by explaining why i would be worried about f takes e5 it's not so much that i love the move d e although i kind of do and what i love about this move is that i'm prognosticating a situation where i'm going to put a rook on the d file and it's gonna x-ray the queen very painfully and i can really do some work down this d-file that i've opened up for myself so no this is sparkling water i'm not drinking a beer at 12 22 a.m before bedtime um so that that's just sparkling water but the mug takes e5 if he had gone 98 believe it or not i would actually be a little bit concerned here because if you look at this pawn chain it looks very good but he's actually threatening to break up the spawn chain with a move c5 and he made this move in the game and we were able to neutralize this move by putting a bishop on f4 and preparing to go d5 against c5 but uh this is as you guys can see a little bit flimsy there's a sense in which this is just a tiny bit flimsy and perhaps we've bitten off a little bit more than we can show so i'm always worried about these kinds of pawn breaks and i don't like to allow them and so for that reason d takes e5 is a little bit safer both moves are good take the advice of capturing toward the center of the grain of salt thank you vic scorcher i appreciate it take that advice with a grain of salt because it's got a lot of exceptions it's among the rules that are that are i would say violated perhaps the most it's not i don't think it should even be a big piece of advice i think it should be like uh something that's accompanied with an asterisk so anyways and the dark squared bishop mr shelby can go out to e3 which is perfectly fine and by the way it stops the d7 knight from coming to c5 which is also good which means that the bishop is going to remain kind of locked in okay so what else happened in this game so boom boom boom boom queen d2 attack now he should have moved his knight to f5 he probably didn't want to allow this very ugly pawn structure in front of the king which is what makes it important we would have castled look at how beautiful white's position is center we can go g4 to make the king side explode that would be the idea and uh this would be crushing so he takes and now the chemo is rook b3 right if we take on h6 uh we win the piece it seems but we give up the knight with check otherwise we would have had knight g5 mating him so we go rook b3 this is the kind of stuff you always have to look for when you have a situation where two pieces are kind of hanging you want to see if you can defend one of them with tempo and then we take on h6 and by the way some people might be wondering why we didn't do this seemingly winning another piece isn't that better than winning a rook winning two pieces but the problem is he can make an intermediate move capture our knight and we're only up a piece for a pawn i guess which is worse than being up a rook the good thing about this is that we've eliminated his strongest piece so it's actually not entirely obvious thank you big score show he should have just taken on f8 right uh because now we if we got 94 he at least can move his queen back without giving up the bishop thank you dolphin big score show throwing out those bits appreciate it my man and uh after 94 the game is over because uh because we basically either force the queen trade or we force him to give up his bishop um yeah but the thing is he's easy it's it's like you're um you know how what analogy should i i'm trying to think of the right analogy for explaining why this is not that important it's like you're you know you're fighting a a boss in a video game you know those video games where you fight a boss at the end and you know you're deciding which of his toenails to like shoot at but the the like huge monster is not gonna feel a little slingshot thrown at his toenail i know it's a weird comparison we're up a rook so it doesn't matter this bishop could be in my grill it could be well it could be in a place where the sun doesn't shine it doesn't matter why it is so the rook is such an overwhelming material advantage in the end game that barring some sort of crazy difference in peace placement it's not gonna matter where you put the bishop thank you blunderbar for the tier three blunderbro with a tier three sub appreciate it man yeah it's like david is fighting goliath and david is like man should i should i aim my slingshot at his like second toe or his third toe like goliath is not going to feel any of that thank you nicola for the thousand bits my man ah appreciate it and thank you big scorcho for another hundred well definitely i was proud i wasn't just proud of charlie i was well that was one of my most memorable days in the past year so we had one more question which is why did i not yeah queen c1 would have been possible but the downside of this move is that it would make it harder to castle long so if if you compare queen c1 knight f5 takes takes here we would just love to castle long uh to be able to attack on the other side of the board as it stands thank you nicola for gifting to photochest as it stands uh we can't do that and as we showed in the game uh queen takes me two is nothing to be afraid of okay so let's play one more hey photochest and let me just take my sweatshirt off one sec yeah so why didn't we play b3 precisely for the same reason that we didn't play queens to it because we don't actually need to defend the spawn because if he takes it he loses the knight which is exactly what happened um okay so that is that game let's play one more and analyze it of course he's easy my pleasure yeah we've got tons of incredibly generous supporters which i am incredibly fortunate to have okay let's go well it is what it is uh ex kyle people just have to live with it okay we are uh seeking a game we have one against zek 007 okay so knight f3 that's the first instance of this move we face let's go d5 um we've been playing the queen's gambit which is a little bit boring but it also allows us to emphasize application of regular themes so he plays the london and actually a an underestimated move against the london is just to copy it people don't do this enough they play e6 all the time but if we just copy the london moves uh we're going to neutralize the music now here does anybody know what typical move is often made when we have a standoff between the bishops what what typically do we do when we have this standoff yeah bishop g6 is right good job uh and i'll explain after the game why it is that that trading is trading is not bad uh but it's it's subpar so we can do the same thing it's a boring position but you got to be able to play these that's part of chess this is as much a chess position as anything else and now uh well we should castle we should definitely castle and and develop and then we can undermine the night how how do we undermine the night what typically another very typical moment in london for black uh which in the idea is to is to um yeah so c5 is right undermining the knight and staking a bet bigger claim this and also you're kind of paving the way for the development of the knight to c6 and our ultimate aim is to smoke out this knight from e5 that is the pride of white's position that is the knight that we are trying to target and we're going to apply methodical pressure to this knight but he's gone g4 so let's unpack this mode for a second it's not a good move um and the reason that it's not a good move is because we can actually win a pawn here but we need to get the sequence of moves right so what is defending this pawn there's two pieces defending pawn on g4 there's the queen and the knight and we have one attacker on this one let me draw it with a different colored arrow actually i can't so we have a knight attacking g4 and we have a queen and a knight defending it hypothetically if we removed both of his defenders from the pawn on g4 then we could win it so we could first take the bishop and then take the knight or but if we take the bishop he'll take with the knight and the queen will remain a defender of the pawn so we first take the knight that's one defender and this reminds me of a movie scene i'll show you guys after then we take the bishop i know exactly and i've shown this before i know exactly what to show you guys after this knight takes g4 boom goes the dynamite and we have the pawn and we also are attacked now some of you might be asking i know a lot of people are thinking this isn't it dangerous to open the g file which is a direct artery to the king the answer is no because because he doesn't have any pieces in the attack and also because here's another pawn and this knight could throw its body against a rook that lands on g1 it would just be biting on granite so as long as we're careful uh his king is also super weak we should we should so let's actually do that let's drop the knight to g6 so that if he puts a rook on g1 uh that rook is going to be entirely neutralized also we can break through in the center with d4 especially since his king is still in the center which is what we're going to do let's break through with d4 while his king is still in the center let's strike while the iron is hot thank you domain appreciate it that was very satisfying boom boom boom and trust me guys i know it's a show so which pawn should we should we take upon if so which punch should we take you guys already know the principle about king safety and pawn structure we should definitely take this one to introduce and let's go after his pawns with queen a5 going after his newly weakened pawns now let's we shouldn't expect to to mate him in the next five move okay so he's he's just hemorrhaging pawns here here's another one now we're three pawns up we shouldn't expect to mate him anytime soon but we're up a million pawns and even a queen trade would be entirely satisfactory here given that we are up three pawns uh now a good move would be to go c4 attacking the knight he he might go rook c1 in fact he probably will i've anticipated this and there's a hidden idea okay no actually he doesn't um now we could trade but we can make a very clever move you guys ready for a very clever move here's the thing that i'm noticing what i'm noticing is that if he takes on c6 i know that looks like uh it might be bad for us because it ruins the pawn structure but if we play b take c6 we'll open up the b file guess what's on the b file white's king there's one small problem which is that the bishop on g3 is covering the b8 square on which a rook could potentially appear so we need to both lure him into taking r knight and if possible uh impede the bishop's control of that square we can do that with the movie five exactly good job now if if white is knows what he's doing he's probably he shouldn't take this knight that would be disaster immediately but there's a high probability he doesn't he he can't resist the temptation i think he will the fact that he's thinking is telling me that he smells a rat but on the other hand if he moves the knight away then our position remains whole yeah he moves the knight away but now we have a tempo what do we use this tempo to do we can use this tempo to bring another piece into the game such as a rook to d8 and uh yeah it's a good move it's you know one of many possible moves and now we can stick this rook right into his grill here on d3 that's a typical typical move where it's supported by a pawn and and now this where is this knight going there is one square that i'm seeing which is the juiciest square of all time forget that i have any pieces on that where does this night belong name a square and there is a currently a piece on that square but we'll get that piece out of that school no not before no no no no think think big think oh that square is a family fork against the queen the king the queen of the rock what are our next two moves likely going to be knight t5 queen a5 like boom boom simple chess here comes knight d5 if he goes e4 then yes then yes we might have to put our knight on b4 which is the next best thing by the way and wait let me think about this oh we have a beautiful move we have a beautiful tactic here now we're thinking about where to move this queen and the ideal thing is if we're moving this queen to deliver a fork against his why don't we sacrifice this queen for something and then we win his entire queen back and then we'll end up up a lot of material presumably now i'm oversimplifying this and i'll explain the full extent of the calculations after the game but we can take the rook queen against three pieces here that's actually super nice three bucks from sucher thank you and the reason this seems like a big mistake is because his queen can take on e1 that's where calcium that's what he does but i've anticipated this what can we do what's the idea yeah so we play rook takes d1 luring the queen back to a forkable square where we fork it and pick it off and we're up in exchange and four pawns in the end game i think that's enough to win the game that's it that's all there is to it and we're just gonna push our pass pawns here again identify the region of the board where you have passpons let's get this rook into the game and push them while activating all of your pieces we don't even need to activate our king here because we have an abundance of resources with which to win the game there was probably something even better in terms of delivering checkmate but this was the simplest yeah because now we can basically play on automatic hundred picks thank you oh italians have a very vast history in chess okay let's get this pawn pushed let's get these pawns on the road okay let's not give up our rook let's give a check king a2 we can continue pushing if he takes we can take with the knight because what we really need to promote is this c pawn the c pawn now has a direct path to heaven although maybe not but yeah he can you can give up his knight for it okay now we're up a full rook and now we're going to start pushing the pawns on the other side of the board his bishop is just going to be completely overwhelmed okay so let's first push this one then we're going to push this pawn and we're going to checkmate him on b2 his bishop is going to be completely well he's probably going to go e6 yep now his bishop is overwhelmed covering this one and that this is what's called trousers and now it's checkmate bishop literally can't cover both at the same time now um what we did in the opening here now bishop g6 what is the idea what is the idea of bishop g6 the idea bishop g6 by and large is that if if white takes the bishop you play hg and you open up a very nice little h file for yourself big score show gifting too you're still thank you and that basically gives black a very very nice source of tension already as early as like move six uh now why is it not an ideal idea to catch around because he plays cd and and the queen immediately gets a very nice avenue to come to b3 and apply pressure on the b7 pawn and then very quickly white's going to get all his pieces out on the queen side black's queen side is going to get under a lot of fire here so um so this is just a little bit nasty uh and for that reason you want to keep the tension now the move g4 is is obviously very premature and this idea of capturing one piece it's like you're standing in line at a buffet and you're starving but there's a bunch of people in front of you taking forever to get food onto their plates and you want to get them out of the picture uh so you take one and then you you know blow the napkin off of another person's plate and then finally you're at the front of the line and you play knight xg4 and there is a movie scene that captures this idea perfectly and i think you guys will appreciate this let me find it yeah it's working now we can watch that other movie so mr bean gets in line and he's yeah so he he knocks the fork off of one person and then he blows the napkin off of another and now it's a very funny scene because and now he's at the front of the line and now you guys will never forget the idea behind the move bishop takes e5 bishop takes e3 right you're mr bean you're removing the defenders one by one of the pawn on g4 and that is kasparov behind me yes but if you take on d3 first then the knight takes so the order of operations please excuse my dear aunt sally is very important so we take take take he should have defended the pawn with knight f3 at least preserving one pawn but he didn't he actually forced us to take the other one now we open up the center and let's fast forward and the movie five is actually very important right because we're luring him into taking on c6 so that we then get a rook on we can pre-move this move rook b8 it's going to be either checkmating or winning a bunch of his pieces or both um so he drops his knight back we stick a rook here get the knight over to d5 and now the key move uh queen takes c1 oh by the way uh if if he had gone roxy one trying to win the pawn like forcing our queen away where would i have put the queen what was the idea what was the queen d3 check so the idea is to use this pawn now as an anchor for the queen and trade queens and remember we are up three pawns that's a huge advantage and we can even give up one of them if it means we get into an end game so this is a simple sort of a simple decision probably not the best move but it's simple enough and it does the trick now the move queen takes you so again if he takes with the knight or if he takes to the rook our response is the same we go knight c3 check and actually for extra credit we would flick in another check just to get his king out of the picture and then we would take the queen he would take hours and at the end of the day we'd end up a piece up the same thing would happen if he took with the the rook but he took with the queen and this is where it's super important to calculate until the end of each line rook takes d1 is the key thank you rich and pure for the prime getting the queen onto a forkable square boom pork winning everything so that was the the game well i appreciate that people enjoy this one
