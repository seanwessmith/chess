okay we got guys guys let's let's practice innocent until proven guilty because i will not stand for random accusations just because he beat me which is which would be ridiculous let's check the game with a computer and then we can make some judgments all right i don't want to i don't want to hear bs because we haven't analyzed anything yet i don't care what he is but imagine if you were 1300 and you actually did play the game of your life would you like somebody to just with one throw of the hand say that you're cheating because i certainly wouldn't so let's check it with the stockfish [Music] all right so five minute games and let us get started hope everyone is ready we have been experimenting with the accelerated dragon sicilian okay we're white against richard let's go e4 okay so he plays the modern which we've seen quite a bit recently and the purpose the modern basically contains its essence in its name it's an opening that really came into business quite recently and and as i mentioned in my youtube video yesterday like 150 years ago people would laugh at this because you're giving white control of the center uh but the reason this is a hyper modern opening is because in the 1920s a group of people came around and they said wait a second let's let our opponents control the center and then we're going to attack this center from a distance king's indian modern all those are part of sort of the hyper modern openings now he goes c5 that's a move that is a move and we're going to take the spawn now sometimes black tries to take this knight and he triples our pawns but in return for tripling our pawns he gives away a very important bishop thank you both of you for the sub so queen a5 attacks the pawn and attacks the knight twice which one of the two should we defend we should definitely defend the night i don't want to let him fork my king and my rook that's that's not good so let's just defend this and that you know simultaneously we're developing a piece in the meantime he's using his queen a bunch and and capturing pawn so this is already a very dubious line now we're going to centralize our knight with knight t5 and we're aiming potentially for this c7 square uh this is actually i think the best way to punish this line this is theory uh although i haven't brushed up on it in a while there's a lot of tactics that will happen uh and and if you're watching this you should already be looking for ways to get the queen onto a square where you can for oh this guy has nerves of steel bishop takes b2 now we can move the rook away and that's entirely possible and let's move the rook away there's no reason not to let's get rid of this threat first and then we'll think about ways to harass the queen now what is the purpose of our play what are we trying to accomplish well our ideal scenario is to get the queen onto a square such that knight c7 is gonna fork the queen the secondary scenario is to get the queen on a square where it doesn't control c7 then we win a rook so bishop b4 comes to mind as a way of chasing the queen away from its control over the c7 score but after queen c6 there is a crucial move that we have to find in order to dislodge that queen and priority number one comes into play when we do that um priority number one comes into play when we do that uh because if we already are primed to look for ways to get the queen onto a forkable square then we of course see the move bishop b5 that's very easy but you have to know what you're looking for and people don't do enough of that you have to set your priorities and set your objective of your calculator what are you trying to find in the first place that way you're not just grasping at straws okay he realizes that he's in trouble he can go queen d4 then we'll just take the queen and win the rook he has no other choice he either gives up his rook or he gives up his queen a great choice queen d4 is technically best because after bishop b5 his queen is trapped you can go to e6 and then we fork him anyway thank you unclear well this is what i live for and i'm not done yet i might go until my flight in the morning okay um so he's thinking he realizes it and that is why i and i always say this but i don't recommend beginners to play these kinds of openings because it's it's and my my russian professor made this analogy about learning russian it's like driving a bus okay you're learning how to drive and you're like man you know i want a kind of car that helps people who learn how to drive uh and let me get a nice bus i'm gonna learn how to drive a bus before i learn before i know how to drive a car uh now is driving a bus impossible absolutely not it can actually be pretty powerful if you know how to do it if you don't know how to do it it's a hot mess back home to san francisco uh and i don't know if this analogy is a little too far out but i think it helps people understand why these kinds of openings can be good at gm level but hard to play at a beginner level or same can be said with manual transmission worst invention in the world okay uh bishop he resigns and it done for unfreezes brief f sorry it briefly oh what if he plays bishop c3 and we just take it we take it because our knight defense e3 and now we win the rook two we win everything uh so again remember to count the number of defenders and attackers that's all there is to it right one two and basically he only has one uh y4 y4 hd that's what we like to see thank you now was bishop takes b2 a good move bishop b2 was terrible i don't actually know what black is supposed to do here but at the very least the very least trying to at least you know you know draw you at least you know what does kasparov do i think knight a6 maybe to control the c7 square although i can't take the knight but now at least i don't have a light squad bishop so c4 is not off limits anymore but how do i know that bishop takes b2 is bad how do i know that so quickly the reason i know that it's not magic it's intuition i can just sense that because he hasn't developed any pieces and i have this tactical idea in play he's going around grabbing pawns and moving the same piece again and again chess is not a magi well it is a magical game but it's also a logical game and when you violate this many principles you're bound to be punished nine times out of ten you know there are openings there are exceptions with modern computers came openings where you violate a bunch of principles and you get away with it but those are rare like the poison pond and the night orf and you have to know them extremely well any questions about this game any questions about this game i don't play subs during the speedrun i play random people in the pool okay why did you decide to move the knight instead of developing other pieces well the reason i decided to move the knight first of all i'm already ahead in development so i can get away with this second of all i see that the c7 square is very weak for him and i can stick a knight there and deliver a fork that is number one number two i see that a queen is in the vicinity of that square so not only can i deliver this check and win the rook but potentially i'm already seeing tactics where i lure the queen onto a forkable square this is too juicy not to play but i mean if you play knight f3 that's fine white is still slightly better no problem it's just that knight c5 is a little bit more ambitious so i'm pretty old okay 15 minute games cesar is what i would say okay um what if he pushes upon to get your knight away well if he pushes the pawn to get my knight away let me call up the game then you don't have to move the knife and this is one of the biggest weaknesses that beginners have is the knee-jerk reaction he attacks the knight let's move the knight we got him with the knight no we don't because there's a queen we can set an equal or stronger threat we can still go bishop before attacking the queen queen moves up to c6 what is y2 can somebody remind me it's the same idea that we had in the game bishop b5 notice that we have not moved our knight okay because the queen is tangled up that's why you don't bring your queen out in the opening because you can can be easily attacked knight c7 and you win the queen okay next game that was relatively simple mr mr pink okay so let's play the king's indian for the first time i've played the queen's gambit thus far let's play king's indian which is my opening the opening i have played for basically all of the time i've played chess probably since the time i was 1700 i used to play the queen's gambit now what is the purpose in one sentence of the king's indian king's indian is a hyper modern opening right it really came to being in the 1920s when people realized that controlling the center with pawns isn't everything so black makes a modest claim to the center but if fiance's bishop which is good night is developed naturally you castle quickly all those things are great and in terms of controlling the center what you do is you prepare this move e5 because e5 is a very weighty uh way to control the sound how do we prepare e5 what's the best way to prepare e5 in a manner conducive to our development there's two main ways to do that in the king's indian rookie 8 is not the best way to do it because remember the key principle guys do not assign a task to one piece if you can assign it to a piece of lesser value so let's just play knight c6 and prepare e5 this way that is a principle that really does hold up a lot of the time if you can assign a task to a piece of lesser value do not assign it to the rook or queen because the rooker queen should be reserved only for the very important tasks such as winning a lot of material now the movie four does not work because he takes we take he takes but this is exactly the kind of position where we would assign the queen a task and the queen could be used to prepare the movie for he has has to play e4 himself and that kind of blunts the bishop now look at his pieces they're all staring at this pawn where's she knight bd7 is also good where should we put this bishop where should we put this bishop and that's a very natural move although usually the bishop is not developed here in the king's indian but what would be the point of rookie 8 then the rook and the queen are just biting on granite yeah let's go bishop g4 active development yeah bishop on d3 creates fork problems he has to go back good job on by him to go back let's bring a rook into the game everything i'm doing so far supernatural just bringing pieces into the game now we have to decide whether we trade bishops or not and i personally don't see a reason to trade the bishop but where should we drop this bishop back should we go back all the way to c8 i don't know why we would exchange here i mean let's go to e6 let's just go back i don't think there's a big difference i think both moves are fine and now i'm going to display one of the key ideas of the king's indian one of the key ideas of the king's indian is the preparation of the f5 pawn break that is the reason why so many people like the king's indian and the way to do that is to remove the knight from f6 notice that i'm not just putting the knight anywhere i'm putting the knight on a square where later it can make its way to f4 let's chase the bishop away if it goes to h4 okay it goes to e3 and now we can accomplish the main idea of the king's indian which is the move f5 beginning the king side operation we got nemo with a rape party at 390. thank you to you thank you nemo for the for the big raid you came at a great time because we are doing my speed on my instructional speed run we are in the middle of a game thank you so much black to play here we need to preserve the bishop we need to preserve the bishop because if we allow him to take it he's going to put his bishop on c4 and this is where i want to share something very important do not be afraid of retreating moves people have this pathological fear of making a retreating move and you absolutely shouldn't fear that he's playing extremely well now he takes f5 as a great move let's take bishop takes f5 and he's gonna probably fork us with queen b3 but the good thing about our position is this queen is kind of bogged down on b7 this gives us a very important opportunity to make stuff happen on the king's side how can we make stuff happen on the king side particularly since the knight is hanging well this is where we have a tactical idea that tactical idea involves intercepting the bishop's defense of the knight on g5 what move am i thinking about yeah this guy is uh this guy is playing very well but we'll see what do we do how do we intercept the bishop's control over the night we need to call jimmy garoppolo here he'll definitely find an interception all right we take on f4 we're attacking the knight he's attacking our knight the pawn on f4 is very strong can later push to f3 shattering the defenses around white's king we are down a pawn but what do we have in return for the spawn we have a big attack against this king we have a pin against the pawn on g2 what tactic does this immediately call to mind what tactic does this immediately call to mind it's a football reference bishop takes h3 he cannot take the bishop because he's pinned we also create a pressure point on g2 okay take stakes bishop f3 would be very strong here okay do we trade we are attacking so we shouldn't trade let's go back to f8 in addition the rook and fe what is it doing here it might seem to you that it's simply biting on granite but the reality is we have the possibility at some point of playing the move f3 what do we do in such a position we have several pieces that are not doing anything in particular the bishop on g7 where can it go where can this bishop go in order to be somewhat employed not f3 because he takes with the bishop in the interest of time i'm gonna play fast this guy's super strong so we need to play a little bit fast let's go bishop e5 okay knight t4 now let's open stuff up with f3 let's open stuff up with f3 now very good player we need to drop this bishop back the reason we need to drop this bishop back is to pave the way for the queen to make its way to h2 he's does our bidding for us now let's go queen h4 let's prepare to infiltrate via h1 he's he's very very strong i mean he's extremely underrated and he's actually outplaying me right now so i'm actually focused you guys will have to let me focus for a second i did not anticipate this from my opponent he started very badly now he's playing extremely well oh no this guy is uh this guy's beating us i'm sorry to say guys after a very poor opening yeah okay this is uh this is very interesting we will check this game but um yeah this this guy this guy got the better of me here in this in this key key battle in the game no not a smurf definitely not a smurf but outplayed me in the worst position is pretty impressive c5 yep let's take three seconds on a force move queen d4 and rook g5 perfect play okay we will check let's let me reserve my judgment although you guys can read my lips and let's take three seconds on a mating move between f6 okay we will we will check the game i don't usually lose to 1300s but there are exceptions okay pretty impressive 1300 ladies and gentlemen oh my lance so he plays a bad opening knight a3 i mean bishop d2 but this is actually computer let's see let me do this properly and check stockfish on my chest space okay wait wait wait guys guys let's let's practice innocent until proven guilty because i will not stand for random accusations just because he beat me which is which would be ridiculous let's check the game with a computer and then we can make some judgments all right i don't wanna i don't wanna hear bs because we haven't analyzed anything yet i do wanna give people the benefit of the doubt okay i don't care what he is but imagine if you were 1300 and you actually did play the game of your life would you like somebody to just with one throw of the hand say that you're cheating because i certainly wouldn't so let's check it with the stock fish okay now i'm what i'm gonna do is i'm going to include stockfish one second so we're gonna skip the first couple of moves because black is much better e4 here was strong okay so we're gonna start here okay e4 was top we're gonna do the top two moves bishop e2 was the top move so anyways um basically starting from this point look castle's a stop top top top top okay he made one in accuracy which is knight g5 but after that track takes takes top top brook 81 a second top top and that king f1 is a crazy king f1 i actually found this resource f3 bishop ca which is strong king f1 is the top move which is incredibly suspicious just to run like this straight under bishop a6 knight e6 is also good top means first first choice of stock fish now even knight c7 just grabbing a pawn and seeing that you could run back queen c6 two queen a6 queen a4 queen 84 we found queen a4 rogue d5 also okay i mean he really made it obvious at the end very obvious at the end um because yeah queen a4 is what makes it obvious because of all the moves you could play here up a piece he chooses a random queen move i know man this is crazy but we will they will investigate and make the appropriate conclusions i knew this was going to happen at some point just because this kind of stuff happens but let's not get too worked up about it let's not get too worked up about it i will report him and chess.com has an unmatched algorithm and they will give her the benefit of the doubt if indeed he played honestly sorry i can't beat stockfish that is not among my talents okay so we're gonna play another king's indian hopefully this one works a little bit better so my opponent is again playing a very weird opening and uh again in the king's indian the purpose is to prepare this movie fi and um another way of doing it is actually to put the knight on d7 um one second thank you mr hoopkiss for the sub now the funny thing is and this is a typical king's indian tactic we can play e5 we can play e5 uh and he could have taken the pawn and i will show after the game why black doesn't lose a pawn so let me write this down now do we want to open the center with e takes d4 who can tell me why or why not we should open the center using the kind of logic that we have discussed at several points on the speedrun so we should because his king is in the center very good uh tarik his king is in the center our king is not that is a crucial observation which basically tells us that if we open up the center we can perhaps better exploit the fact that his king is still in the center now how should we exploit it exactly well fact of the matter is the pawn on e4 is pinned which means it cannot move which means that what move comes to mind in order to try to win that pawn d5 is correct good job yale work and if he castles he gets forked okay he goes e5 good move but now the spawn is very weak how do we go about winning the spawn 100 bits thank you thank you how do we go about winning this pawn where should we put this knight now by the way the knight is not being attacked we are not moving the knight because he's attacking that we are moving the knight because we want to win the pun very important so there's no confusion now we're going to win a very important central pawn yes he's going to get to castle he did a good job not you know not panicking but he's going to be down a very crucial central pawn our bishop is going to be super strong and he's in very big trouble so in any case yeah i take c5 and we're going to remove knight takes c5 we don't want to now generally this king's indian bishop we do not you do not generally want to give away a fiance bishop that's that's a good rule for some of you guys to learn the fiance bishop is very important because if you give it up you create a ton of holes along uh the moves that you kind of board out with the move g6 so you would only give the fiance bishop away for a lot of material and even then sometimes you don't what should we do here how this bishop is annoying me now knight takes f3 does not win a piece knight takes f3 does not win a piece because he takes with the knight and that knight simultaneously defends the bishop 24. so how do we try to get this bishop onto a square where it can be captured by this bishop let's go c5 and chase the bishop maybe he moves it back and then he blunders a bishop what should he do he should play knight takes e5 or bishop takes c5 but that gives away a crucial bishop in his own right and then our bishop on g7 is going to be uncontested which is exactly what we want okay very good knight takes e5 our bishop is now uncontested and incredibly strong along the long diagonal we're up upon we have a great position out of the opening and he plays a weird move rookie too now let's take his other bishop so that we have two bishops against two knights in an open board awesome stuff where should this bishop go think about exactly what this bishop should be doing what should it be attacking where should it go i know a lot of people are probably going to say g4 right now but it's a lot more effective for the bishop to come to f5 i talked about this two days ago i think on the speedrun where rather than doing something general like delivering a pin you want your pieces to be doing specific things here the bishop is attacking a weak pawn and that weak pawn is very hard to defend because he's so passive we're gonna take on e1 if he takes to the queen we take the pawn if he takes with a knight well then he has to bring another piece back all right thank you for the pawn now what do we do in this position to win we're up two puns a lot of people struggle to win positions like these there is a checklist of items that you can go through the first of these items is whether or not we can create a passpond when we are up bonds by definition it should be easier for us to create past funds can we create one particularly because bishops are a lot better than knights at managing past pawns we have a pass spawn on the d file but we can create a better one on the c file why because if you look at the bishops and what they're doing specifically what squares are they controlling boom boom they are controlling c3 and c2 both squares that the pawn wants to go to so the red carpet for the pawn has been unraveled if we tried to push our deep on it would have been much harder to push it further uh in part because the bishop is in its way c3 c2 comes with tempo and then we can use this bishop to control the promotion square and promote winning a lot of pieces very simple the knights are dominated knights are very bad at stopping past pawns remember that principle now a lot of people would play c2 here but could somebody tell me why c2 might be a little bit inaccurate what does it allow white to do uh which may prolong the game for a couple of moves red fury you deserve a sub for that very good he might take on c2 now yes we're open exchange i don't want to give this pawn up just for an exchange i want to win this queen so what should we do we should go rook c8 very patient move bring the pieces into the game 91 he's defending well he wants to take our bishop i don't particularly care about that and actually we can make a very tactical move here let me make the move first and then i will explain it afterward i can play c2 i know you guys are whoa whoa whoa see we're blundering the pawn you're allowing him to take a bit what are you doing i will explain it there is a tactical reason behind the smoke the tactical reason behind this move is that first of all if he takes my bishop then i take back okay so in this position there's multiple ways to win the game uh can somebody name one of them and i would recommend that you think about this by trying to understand where the queen on dc on d8 belongs yes zazy gifting to redfear thank you we should take the knight and what move should we make now to end the game immediately bishop h6 very nice you guys bishop h6 wins the game on the spot i actually didn't even see that the other move would be queen d1 same idea dislodging the queen from c1 guess what we did we gived up the we gived up we gave up the theme keto bishop and we gave it up for very good reason we gave it up in order to make a second queen that is a worthwhile cause to give up our king's indian bishop it gives itself up for the greater good he correctly gives this queen up for the rook and for the pawn but it doesn't matter we're going to combine the queen and the rook to win this knight combine the queen and the bishop rather to win this night and that game is going to be over kinetic energy our pieces are full of kinetic energy here and kinetic energy is exactly what we need and we win the game now the move c2 uh when he resigns which i'm anticipating because we are about to win his knight as well it is gg okay how do we win this position well the easiest is to go after this pawn and then promote our password we don't even need to go after that pawn we could straight away make a pass pawn uh by the way i would not recommend people pre-move in such a situation because he does have a knight i also see a lot of people in such a situation giving up their queen for the last remaining piece there's no need to do that you don't need to like eliminate all of your opponent's pieces he's only got a knight that's not a big deal here i can pre-move v2 because he was pinned he's probably to go here i have a feeling he's going to go there no knight f4 mate very good now let's jump right into the move c2 why did i make this move the move knight takes c2 seems to refute this because if i take and the number of defenders equal the number of attackers and so this is just a trade and we lose our promoted fund so can somebody tell me what it is that i had in mind here i want a couple people to think about this to tell me what the move is in this position as i open another lock that moves indeed queen c7 and the move queen c7 wins the pin tonight on c2 because he cannot bring the other knight to reinforce it and so i will simply win a full piece and i also have a pawn and the rook is arrested or trapped because the bishop is completely circumscribing it that's the king's indian bishop for you ladies and gentlemen how did i find this move how do i think of a move like c2 like what is the process and i know a lot of people are wondering like great i see the point now tell me how the hell you found this move first of all be under no illusions it is not the only move in this position we could have also dropped the bishop back and attacked the rook and then attacked the rook again and in this position what could we do to get a screen out of c1 that would be the alternative way to win this position and then i will explain the process behind finding such a move circumscribing not circumcising it's not bishop h6 because the pawn isn't on c2 yet here we have to play queen d1 we basically force the queen out of c1 it can go to f4 or whatever but then we go c2 and in this case we go c2 again now in order to help you guys understand how to find such a move i will refer to my good friend sam shanklin i call this the sam shanklin question sam shanklin question is named in his honor good friend of mine he's grand master former u.s champion from the bay area i've known him for many many years the sam shanklin question it's not that he invented this but when he teaches at camps he always has a lecture on this topic and i think it's a very inspirational topic and the topic is when your opponent prevents a threat when you have an idea and your opponent prevents that idea or you feel like it's impossible the question you have to ask yourself is what happens if i do it anyway you have to ask yourself what happens if i do it anyway because that alerts it awakens in your brain it basically passes the membrane which tells your brain i can't do something because that square is defended because that piece is hanging because this is threatened and it allows you to consider moves that you otherwise wouldn't consider and this is a great example of that your brain tells you that this is impossible because this blunders a pawn but if you stare at this position for a second most of you stop queen sisab it's a it's a weird kind of paradox but it actually really works and i can give you many examples of when i applied this success that's not the only way to find c2 but that is one thing that you can do to lighten your tactical load sorry that wasn't the actual position um the actual position was this one although it doesn't matter so knight e1 prevents c2 that's the purpose of knight one what happens if we do it anyway ah i have queen c7 winning the night i hope this makes sense to you guys i can give you plenty of examples but i want to keep the speed run rolling i can let me actually look up my games for a good example oh i can give you an example against sam shankland uh one of the few games in which i've beaten him he is a much stronger player than me and he has speed me many times so be under no illusions that but i have a good good example of a game against sam many many years ago where i actually applied this principle i didn't know it exactly by name but i i did uh sorry something is wrong with my stream sorry my stream is going crazy i don't want this okay there we go finally i get to be a speedrun live my pleasure one moment please ladies and gentlemen this is a very this is one of my favorite yeah 10 bucks from bill bill thank you so much bill bill with a bomb i really appreciate all of these donations all of the bits all of the subs that's really awesome and again i this this means so much to me so thank you everybody okay so i'm just again chess space is very finicky when it comes to obs you guys will have to be a little bit patient thank you eric for 500 bits let's go this is too much guys thank you so much eric and finally i am ready to show you guys to see this is a great great example it's worth the wait this is one of my one of my proud moments jam jam with a thousand bits uh-oh we're going in in increments of 500 now all right so finally we can switch to the chess-based scene neritsky against shankland no these ratings are not mistaken i was 1900 sam was 2100. yes that did exist we are playing in 2006 and we reached the position that is in front of you now in this position i found a really really strong idea and i found this idea by applying a very similar logic uh to the sam shanklin question slightly different but i'll explain now how do we look at a position like this material is equal and it doesn't seem like very much is going on there is no peace and balances both sides have a knight in a bishop black has some pressure going on on the queen side right he's got he's got some some ideas down the a file maybe but white has i have my own assets i have a very nice blockading bishop in the center and i have some action here potentially with uh with some f5 pawn breaks so basically i was thinking about going g4 and f5 but it is a little bit weakening so i decided not to do it but then i i thought i i basically made a wish list and and this is something i recommend to people uh very strongly to make a what does the wish list mean it means you look at your pieces and you say you know if i could put a particular piece on any square i wanted what square would that be because that can again awaken in you the sort of tactical instinct so this knight i wasn't happy with it's on c5 it's got a lot of kinetic energy but very low potential in it what is it doing like it's not really doing anything just sitting there you cannot take the pawn because that pawn is defended and i thought where would i want to put this and where where do i really want to put this knight there is a very juicy square somewhere in black's territory that i can potentially get this knight to well i want to get ooh i want to get here and why do i want to get it i'm going to make why the hell do i want to get here well because this is a beautiful knight and if he takes it lobster pins are made coming up one order this is amazing for the attack black doesn't have his fiance bishop he talked about this but i can't get the knight to uh to f6 because both squares are covered respectively by the pawn of the queen and then i ask myself the sam sam shanklin question rather than abandoning the idea you ask yourself what happens if i do it anyway and which move did i play which move did i play in the game it's not knight d7 i'll give you that hint that does blunder the knight and a lot of you have already said the move it is 94. very good 94 is correct because if d takes e4 then that pawn was defending the other night i take the other knight and white is much better here i don't get to get the knight to f6 but look at what happens look at how many weak pawns he has now this pawn is oh i want to highlight it sorry this spawn is weak and this spawn is weak now his bishop is terrible so this is a horrible scenario and if he doesn't take then he's got to allow the knight to f6 and so this basically won me the game sam did have a resource here that would have preserved a solid position for him which is the desperado sack knight 65 i believe but he missed it and actually uh the funny thing is i didn't even immediately get the knight to f6 i first sorry he went h6 i went h4 and h5 and then i got the knight to f6 he took it and i basically well i didn't made him but the attack was incredibly strong i'm actually threatening now to take on h6 with checkmate and this is all because he doesn't have that bishop and this is all because of this pawn and he finally gave his rook up for it but i got a winning end game i won't analyze this in depth but you guys get the point the sam shanklin question ladies and gentlemen very very important in order to find creative tactics does the bishop have to take my knight well if he doesn't take uh that was the lesser evil relatively speaking uh because if he doesn't take then i'm basically gonna lift my rook up and i'm gonna have some queen sack ideas um in any case there's many games where i can show this but let's go back to the speedrun and let's continue with the next game
