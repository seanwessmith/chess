i was playing the u.s championship in

2000

uh i think this was 14. on the rest day

of the us championship which is a day in

which no games were played it allows the

players to catch their breath usually in

the middle of the tournament

there's usually some sort of

get-together that's hosted uh by

one of the organizers just to let the

players chill a little bit and and in st

louis next to the chess center which i'm

sure some of you have been there

there is a a big house that's owned by

rex and

that house is used to host sometimes the

commentators you know some people

dignitaries who come to st

louis it's a big big you know stately

house

uh and the sort of rest day party was

held there and yasser was there playing

blitz with maurice ashley

um and you know some of the players were

there fabi was there

you know it's it's fun you know it's

intense but it's fun we're all competing

but

we're all trying to be friendly uh and

you know some drinks are served and it's

very important during a tournament to be

as healthy as you can possibly be you

know no shenanigans

uh but i allowed myself a a drink uh on

the rest day which is

rare but you know just one but yasser

who is you know

i know that he's rooting for me and he

always has been

he's coming around 15 bucks from the

crazy fool and he looks at me holding a

cup and he's like

and you know yasser is so chill he gets

super intense

he's like that's that's not alcohol is

it and and he's like dead serious and i

get

i get like so red and i'm like no that's

just sprite

uh but but it was just funny that you

know yasser is very chill but i know

he's he can be intense too and i mean

that in a very good way

okay let's get started uh let me get my

notebook ready

so i can take notes and uh answer

questions properly

or should i shall i say properly let's

go e4

knight f3 okay but okay maybe some

italian

some some italian chess very good but

okay

we can play fried liver okay but i think

we will play simple chess g3 okay

supports up one castle here very nice

but okay this is boring chess but it is

very effective to illustrate the

principles of chess we go c3 now to

prepare d4 this is typical theory

but okay i see ukraine

this is a typically named inaudible okay

so this is uh let's get serious

uh i'm supposed to be instructive people

say i'm i can be a good teacher so i so

i gotta i gotta hold that reputation

uh okay so this is the mainline italian

uh the mainline italian has become

incredibly popular recently i only

played it once

in my life since i became a gm i played

it to beat my only super gm

yakivenko so i have a good experience

with it

i don't have a great handle on white's

main ideas but

what are the essentials of of this setup

right why am i doing what i'm doing

the pawn on c3 is as you guys know

helping to prepare d4

i can't play d4 yet and what i'm going

to do in this position

is i'm going to orchestrate a very

typical maneuver you guys who play the

ray lopez i'm sure you know this

this knight from d2 is going to go to g3

what is the purpose of that the purpose

of that

is that the knight will have access to

this incredibly strong square on

f5 uh it doesn't mean i'm going to go

there immediately because there's a

bishop on c8

but i'm going to threaten that and he

goes knight r4 now the second idea of

the italian

comes into play do you remember i played

c3 i just talked about this

how do i defend against this threat in

the most efficient manner what do i do

uh and and this shows you how flexible

and how resilient of an opening the

italian is we go t4 we intercept the

bishop and we do it with tempo

this move is useless we can actually

play h3 and do something productive for

our position

and chase the knight away he gives us

the whole center not a good idea he

probably wants to go here he's attracted

by this move at tempo

but i've already talked no he's not okay

so bishop a7

uh and okay this is annoying the hell

out of me so let's get it out of there

and uh let's complete our maneuver that

we started with knight g3 don't forget

to do that

okay goes he's playing already well i

mean our opponents are already playing

pretty well

uh and these wins are not going to be

that easy so how do we continue our

development

such that we do not obstruct any of our

pawns and any of our control over pawns

so where where should we put this guy um

e3 d2 what do you guys think

we can actually put it on e3 and and

this is a typical

idea in the italian uh it relies on

tactics but in this game just to keep

the simplicity i'm gonna go bishop f4

which is not my favorite move

but it's fine uh and i will explain why

bishop e3

is generally the way that this is played

because e4 is actually untouchable

okay um we haven't really completed okay

well bishop b7 first of all notice that

he's relinquishing his control over f5

not only that but what he's doing and

this people might not see

right this king is actually really

really weak it's not really surrounded

by any of his pieces you guys can see

that all of his pieces are kind of

clustered on the queen side

and we can prepare a very typical

sacrificial idea

to blast open uh the king inside now you

guys might be seeing bishop takes h6 but

can this move be prepared can we prepare

to take on h6 so that it comes with a

lot greater effect

and if so how and again this is this

idea is entirely within the range of

typical

now a lot of you want to go knight to

five but i'm greedy i don't want to give

this e4 pawn

i don't want to give away the c4 pawn i

want to i want to prepare it in another

way and i'm going to go queen d2

uh and knight f5 would be fine actually

we can give the spawn up anyway and take

on h6 and i'm sure that's good

but i wanna i wanna avoid any kind of

complication

not only that but notice that when i

take on h6 i'm gonna have a queen that

lands on h6

i said many times that you need to

employ the queen only for the most

sort of big balls tasks this is a pretty

big boss task i mean you're trying to

check me the king

i'd say this is good enough to involve

the queen wouldn't you

the knights are performing right now a

defensive role

that's great they are supporting the

central pawns but they might just as

well when the king side opens perform an

attacking role

when i climb a little bit in raiding

i'll talk about kinetic and potential

energy i think i talked about it already

in previous streams but i'll talk about

it again in the context of the stream as

we take on h6 as flind

uh and and taken h6 he's completely

busted here look at his king it's it's

wide open

now knight f5 is going to be incredibly

strong because he has no defense to

checkmate he has to give away his queen

in the game and look how quickly we

didn't even do any attacking

as my coach would say prepare slowly

attack fast this is what that means

right you do all the necessary

preparations

so that you don't have to go crazy when

you're attacking you can just

make easy moves and by the way i had an

even better way to prepare queen g7 what

would it have been

it wouldn't have even allowed him to

give up a queen

while the pawn has pinned the f-pawn has

been what would

what would it have been

no no he didn't say anything

i

knight h5 yeah knight h5 would have been

even more precise it doesn't matter i'm

completely winning because we are up a

queen and we're mating him

i think that's good enough thank you

eric uh

i think that's good enough intro light

thank you for the prime let's go knight

g5 he's pinned and we're gonna prove him

pre-move checkmate uh this is pretty

straightforward attacking uh okay mate

i'm not gonna go over this with a fine

toothed comb

um at this point this is just standard

attacking practices

this was actually a really good game um

and it's a very instructive one in terms

of illustrating some of the main ideas

of the italian

which i'm going to do after the game in

the meantime let's continue playing

uh and i will do some sub sub events on

my main account so i knew i'll play you

and uh let's continue with e4 let's do

another italian i think well okay

i don't know guys why it is that the

philidor is so popular at this level i

wasn't aware of that

uh and i don't particularly like it okay

so he's playing like the duke of

brunswick against morphe and perhaps the

most famous game of all time

does anybody know how white should

respond to this move

this is this is following the famous

opera game which probably over 50

percent of you know

it's also one of the most overrated

games of all time now the idea of bishop

g4 is to pin the knight the problem is

he has to take the knight in order to be

able to recapture the pawn this is

exactly how the morphe game went

what did morphy play here uh and it's a

very natural move

i bet morphy made here in order to

develop a tempo he plays bishop c4

are we doing this to threaten scholars

mate no this is

this is not how it went right the guy

playing duke of brunswick played knight

f6 and then morphy played queen b3 i

think

uh we could play queen b3 anyway but

then he's going to go queen before check

and he's going to force the queen trait

so let's just focus on developing

i am angry i can't recreate it so let's

keep developing

okay let's just keep developing we are

still overwhelmingly better we have the

two bishops

uh his queen is obstructing the

development of his bishop i mean he's in

very bad shape here and we're just going

to keep developing

he continues to push his pawns out i

don't know why he's not concerned about

this

all right so how should we accumulate

the pressure we've done some of the key

development moves what else can we do

for our position here to take care of

our pieces uh and remember

we don't always have to develop all the

pieces in sequence donald

trump i i agree with that approach rook

b4 b5 would be very

very creative idea i like that but let's

let's play more stereotypically let's

get the rook to an open file

uh to restrict his king even further oh

man he's asking for it isn't he

queen f6 do we trade queens obviously

not where should we slide our queen to

think about the pathways to the king

where should we put our queen uh this

would be

tempting but it doesn't actually

threaten anything right because both of

these squares are covered

can we try to threaten a square that's

not currently covered

i see some of you saying h3 and that's

exactly right or jeff i would play queen

g4

the reason why is because we're not

making the tempting move that looks the

nicest

we're trying to actually get the queen

over to c8 this square is uncovered

the other thing we're trying to do is oh

oh man oh my lands this was

not the greatest yeah okay mate okay he

just resigned okay he thought i'm

rubbing it in his face by not moving but

i'm just trying to involve everybody in

the process

and and before i go to the next game i

just wanted to

to to clarify a couple of things here

why did i not play queen d3 so first of

all

i wrote a chess.com article a while ago

called queen the supporting actress

and i had the privilege of training with

yasser sarawan a couple of years ago in

st louis i did a three-day training

session with him and he actually

revolutionized my perspective on

some of these things including the role

of the queen

and yasser yes daniel so

first of all yes so what yasser said

is is that very often

this reminds me first of all of a story

so okay but

seriously because i want to keep things

going smoothly and this will not be a

long stream

yasser said that the queen we often

think of it as the main attacker the

queen is the main attacker it's the main

the big balls character

not always true the queen is sometimes

best in a supporting role

and i made this analogy to napoleon

stuck in russia

consider the queen to be your main

general right queen is remain war

general

are you going to send out your main war

general into the battle of sumter or

whatever first battle you're fighting

um is it going to be doing the frontline

fighting

or is it going to be in the shadows

directing the conflict it's not a great

analogy because the chest is not war

and blah blah blah but you get the point

the queen is often best in the shadows

because it has

long-range capabilities it doesn't need

to be in your opponent's face

we've talked about this theory that's

why very often we want to play moves

like queen d3 we wanna we want the queen

to be first you know we want the queen

to aim at the king

it's not always how the queen works best

by putting it on h3 we're putting it on

a safe place where it's shaded by

by some of the pieces and pawns and in

addition the queen is a lot more

effective

here aiming for c8 and d7 then it would

be on d3 where it's aiming for d8 which

is covered quite well by our opponents

uh i don't want to belabor the point

here i think people get it but just

wanted to kind of

emphasize that that's the case you can

search up my article if you want more

about this called queen the supporting

actress that's how yasser called it

one more game and then we're going to

autopsy the last three mate

71 from slovenia i think okay let's play

the sicilian again

we played this italian once yesterday

i'm gonna play it again and he plays

bishop c4

now listen up and i'll talk more about

tournaments and everything later i

promise

this is very commonly played by

beginners against the sicilian it is a

literal transposition of the italian

against this italian the problem is it

doesn't work the same way

and there is a very simple reason why

the reason why bishop c4 is not as

effective

in the sicilian as in the italian

usually why is it

exactly you can play e6 you can blot the

bishop and furthermore

you can play d5 and occupy the center

with tempo okay

now i have the center get out of here

and look at this bishop just staring at

my well-defended pawn that's not the way

you want it to be

now we can just develop our pieces

normally and we've got a great position

i'm playing quickly here

this position how do we continue

developing and we do so

the same way that we would in any

opening you don't need to think of the

situation as speaking another language i

mean

we just develop our pieces actively in

the same exact way we could have also

played h6 by the way to stop his bishop

from coming out to g5 but the reality is

this bishop's development is a lot

he's asking for it again what should we

do what would i do here

you guys have seen enough of my my

psychopath games

to know what the heck it is i would i'm

sacking the knight here i'm not gonna

let him get away with this stuff okay

probably unsound

and that's the reality of it probably

unsound but look at his king

look at the pin and uh we need to be

very careful here for black we don't

just want to willy-nilly throw our

pieces at the king

that's not how you attack uh the move

knight t4 believe it or not he can

actually take on d5 and simultaneously

defend the knight

so we got to be very careful here let's

do this anyway because it's the point is

not

to win his knight the point is to

orchestrate this tension on his knight

that can be then

used as currency okay well he doesn't

see it

for the record bishop takes d5 uh would

have defended his knight i'll explain

how i would have proceeded then

he goes king g2 which is a big mistake

what should we do

in order to transform our attack into a

material advantage

very simple move um

bishop takes knight it's a fork against

the queen the knight defends the bishop

and let's take stock we have a queen for

two pieces and we have a couple of pawns

on top of it

we're probably not gonna be able to

defend this pawn but that's fine let's

try to remove the last remaining

defender on his king right his king is

somewhat protected by his bishop

what can people suggest to do and i know

some people probably are thinking d4 but

remember my key piece of advice here

when you're up this much material your

top priority is not to defend every

single pawn which is not to say you

should be giving them away willy-nilly

but honestly that should be very low on

your list of priorities okay what should

we do now now that we've removed the

bishop from f4 the bishop has been

replaced with a knight

knight's far worse defender and we can

actually bring our queen we can pin the

knight attack the pawn

and obviously we can play g5 and just

snap this knight off and the game is

over

all right a very simple attack uh and

now

some of the key rules of attack are

displayed

by which i mean we we should bring all

of our attacking pieces and we shouldn't

try to rely only on the queen

and ever i mean i really like the fact

that everybody's just finding moves here

so

this is awesome you guys are i know that

some of you are

paying attention actively and

concentrating and i really appreciate

that

it's an honor uh to have to have people

like that and and i know

everybody's busy so thank you i i this

means a lot to me people are really

actively engaged and that's awesome okay

uh regarding the discord yeah i've been

really slacking

but as you guys know i've been really

pushing the content production

production recently this this takes time

for me to prepare

uh and i'll try my best to keep that up

as i stabilize

okay uh well thank you note again the

honor is all mine and i appreciate it

truly

but i'll talk about that later let's do

the autopsy on the games and then we're

going to continue

now this first game we played the main

line italian most people

play the fried liver for the record the

fried liver

does not win it is not it is a good

opening i mean gm's play it

but what should black do in this

position in the fried liver uh for those

of you who play one e5 with black do not

take the knight

the pawn on d5 you already know this you

should play knight a5

uh and this leads to some you know very

interesting complications black

sacrifices upon

if you want more about this i did a

session with nicola which will continue

as well where we talked about this at

length

black is compensation for the pawn in

what form well black is an initiative

right black is attacking all of white's

pieces he's pushing his funds

we're not going to delve into the

opening intricacies here just suffice it

to say the position is about equal

by modern theory uh opinion and uh it's

an interesting line

uh but the mainline italian is uh has

had a resurgence recently obviously it's

been around since basically the 1600s

uh but but but it's a very uh it's a

very rich opening and

it's it's an opening that i'm kind of

sick of seeing at the high level because

the game's in a draw very often

it's similar to the rye lopez in several

different ways how would i describe a

position like this what would you

what would you pay attention to there's

a couple of things to notice here blacks

both sides are very solid

um both sides let me check discord

aquila ooh

tequila in russian wow nice that does

look very nice

so both sides are you know very solid

here very solid structurally white

is supposed to have maybe a little bit a

little bit of something because of this

idea of going d4

i'm not gonna delve into the details of

this

uh i will say what is the best for e4

players right lopez every time i

personally have played the rye lopez

a lot longer than i played the italian i

used to play the attack well actually i

never played the italian i played the

scotch

so when i was 14 1500 and when i come

home in a week

i will i and i forgot to do this the

last time but i will get

out some of my old score sheets and i'll

show you guys

some of my oldest score sheets from 2003

2004. i've kept all of them

uh and i used to play the scotch and

after the scotch i played the rye lopez

which is

a different kind of opening than the

italian right it's similar in some ways

and it's different in others it's just

it leads to different types of positions

uh and

and it's hard for me to summarize in one

or two sentences what the differences

are contained but there are similarities

and there's transpositions even

from the italian to the rye lopez the

one thing that i want to say if you do

play the italian or the rye lopez

in this position you can play the move

bishop e3

very common idea also in the rye lopez

why is knight takes c4 impossible can

somebody tell me an

extra credit two reasons why knight

takes e4

loses the game or loses a lot of

material i did insult your parakeets

codex i didn't miss your question the

lolly i will get back to it

codex i sorry i missed your question

initially but i'll get back to it knight

takes e4

very careful we've talked about this

scenario

black can take on e1 with check and then

he takes the bishop so careful one is

this

boom boom folkovich no way for black to

save both pieces and then there's

another fork

well actually okay i'm lying to people

i'm meant to say queen c2 also forks but

black can go queen e8 and defend both

pieces

and then now you're gonna have to go

bishop d5 anyway so the reality is both

of these are

reliant on bishop d5 um let's move on to

the second game

which was which was a very quick one now

morphy against duke of brunswick

is one of the most famous games of all

time i know that um

most of you have seen it before i think

it's one of the most overrated games of

all time

it's also called the opera game why is

it called the opera game because it was

played

during a production of an opera paul

morphy

went to europe to play the strongest

players in the world at that time

because he'd beaten everybody in the

united states he was invited by a

dignitary i think from austria to to

attend an opera

and uh anybody who's been to i mean i

respect opera greatly but

it's got some comfortable seats and

about 10 minutes into production of

norma

which i don't remember who the composer

is but i knew that was the opera

um so now you know more about the opera

game than anybody else

um it was during production of norma uh

and

morphe turned to duke brunswick who

invited him so i'm bored

let's go to the popcorn stand except

it's the 1800s you don't serve popcorn

with opera

let's get some beer okay they got a

glass of beer during the intervention

let's play some chess

that we can all agree on so they sit

down they start playing a chess game

duke brunswick and his friend

uh count isaward a second austrian

dignitary

sits down with paul morphy and they

start bellini okay

and uh they were not very good and

that's part of the reason i think this

is a very overrated game this is how the

game started in this position

count and duke played knight f6 which

allowed morphy to slide his queen to b3

and

fork these two pawns and the game went

on for them i'm not gonna show the game

our opponent play queen e7 which is

probably even worse because uh

it obstructs the development of the

bishop and it allows our knight to get

to d5 with temple now he's going to burn

another tempo to stop her knight's get

from t5 i mean so this is just

a humongous material advantage and

really the most important move of the

game was here

the move queen h3 we got a donut oh

chewy with 50. picture this as a

birthday card from your

game well thank you chewie for the uh

for the 50 bucks the support today has

been incredible

uh as has the viewership and and the

the the community so thank you chewie

for 50 bucks and all of your support

i appreciate it very much thank you

thank you so much

th the right move for black here would

probably be 97 but now the bishop can't

develop

the poor bishop on f8 uh is always

blocked by some pieces and now we can

try to get our bishop to c5

capture that knight and get our queen to

see it notice that he cannot move the

other night because he's always gonna

get checkmated i mean that's what he

tried to do

and he got checkmated so uh you know

this is

this is just a horrendous position and

that's why i don't recommend the

philidor

uh because because it's an opening that

in order to play it properly

you have to really know a lot of theory

you have to you know you really have to

analyze it well and you can get into

this kind of trouble

so this brings me to the final game

and um this is uh the move bishop c4

which

uh here in charlotte we call this the

scholastic variation

and and the reason we call it the

scholastic variation is because

a lot of kids particularly they they

play the italian or they play the

bishops opening

and they they uh assume not illogically

that

this would be a good move against the

sicilian and it's it loses a lot of its

effectiveness

oh loli yes sorry codex my bad i might

totally my bad sorry about that we had a

very

good question from codex about the an

opening called the lolly so

a beef when it gar challenged me i was

talking about this position where

there's a very famous move knight takes

f7 this is the classical way to refute

uh the fried liver and recently it has

been determined

that the move d4 is also very good

okay and uh this is not what people like

to hear because i'm basically saying

you're not supposed to sack the knight

you can just play t4 and explode the

center

uh but i believe according to modern

theory and i'm checking right now in

chess base

now how would i check such a thing and

let's make a quick detour for me to

explain this let's say that i'm a gm

whatever

i have a question which of these opening

lines is better what do you do

here's where i go into chess base and

let me share with you guys a chess-based

board and show you exactly

how i would determine to determine this

and how i would analyze

how would i analyze an opening which i

don't know assuming you have chest space

i know not all of you have chest space

i don't recommend it to everybody but um

i'm going to share the entire

chest-based board with people

and i'm going to just expand this so

that so that you can see the notation

and so that you can see stockfish when i

open

it so just please bear with me for a

moment

okay so

let us just a little bit smaller

and then this a little bit bigger and

let's make this smaller and then this

bigger

and then this bigger okay this is not

going to be the best uh

capture but you get the you get the

general image of it

and i'm gonna make my camera smaller so

you can see okay so this is this is

chess space and there's more things up

on top here which i'm gonna display for

aesthetic appeal

i mean this is what the entirety of the

program basically looks like

uh they basically copied microsoft word

in a certain sense uh and and they did

that deliberately

sorry i'm just trying to expand this to

include everything and it's not easy

this is fine now one of the greatest

features of chess space

is the reference button and the

reference button allows you to see

all of the recorded games that have been

played in a particular position

as you can see uh nike five has been

played

36 well d3 is the main move 36 000 and

it gives you a bunch of statistics about

every move that has been played

percentage and it's always from white's

perspective so white wins 54.4 percent

of the game which is normal for white

uh you can see the best players you can

see frequent players

and you can see all of the moves here so

i mean if you go down the list there's a

lot of crazy i mean somebody played

king e2 probably hikaru uh okay no

montevani played kingy too

that's probably some sort of a a mistake

because this guy's a reputable i am

uh okay so that's a that's good to know

but anyways

we go to the fried lover and to address

codex's question

knight a5 is the main move knight takes

d5 you can see has been played four

thousand times and white scores

overwhelmingly in both knight takes f7

and d4

so i we can see that knight takes f7 is

the main move but this move d4

uh is a recent a recent move we can see

that it's been played a couple times in

2020

it's played a lot in the late 2000s uh

so and white scores overwhelmingly well

which basically tells us that this line

needs to be investigated that's actually

how you find rare lines

if you see that the line has scored so

well that probably means

uh it deserves investigation uh even

though

uh it might be very rare and it might

not have been played by that many good

players

we can also click on elo white to see

the highest rated player who's done

something here we see

a short-plated hubner a lot of gm's

thank you for the 400 bits sriracha

i'm good and now we involve our beast we

involve stock fish

and stock fish will tell us a lot of

what we need to know

about the lime this is stock fish 12

this is the latest version of stock fish

and stockfish has a function called

depth

and depth is essentially how many moves

ahead stockfish sees the higher the

depth

of the more informed the opinion about

the position you get the more reliable

it

normally when i'm analyzing an opening i

want to let stockfish reach depth 35

before i really trust its evaluation

as you can see it's giving an evaluation

at approximately depth 32 of plus minus

which means that white is clearly better

thank you lily

and the evaluation is going down

slightly uh

and uh you can see that white is much

better here but we would go back and see

knight takes f7

and we would let it sit here and we

would analyze and we would basically

just see the evaluation i mean this

isn't rocket science

at least initially the evaluation is not

as overwhelming as we might think

um and and what happens when you're a gm

and you're trying to analyze this is you

essentially look at all of the moves

that have been played by humans

you list them you say he takes d479 main

line bishop e7

and on top of that you always include

stockfish's main move because you assume

that people prepare for this

and then you basically use stockfish to

create a file right if this isn't rocket

science

um this is how i would do it i would

just create a file by analyzing all of

these lines and trying to figure out

white's best continuation and eventually

i'd get a sense of if this line i would

rather play and i would do the same

thing with knight takes f7 which is of

course more fun

uh and and he would do this as well so

this is not the most interesting thing

but to answer your question codex i

think that d4 is considered right now to

be a little bit better

than knight takes f7 it's a little bit

cleaner and it's harder for black to

actually play

and the purpose of d4 is that you open

up the bishop and in this position

you can see the evaluation white is

winning and the reason that white is

winning is because he's got this

incredibly strong knight he's got all

these files i mean the king is just

caught in the crossfire

of this position and now you play knight

takes f7 and this is much stronger in

comparison

because you've got the e-file uh in

comparison to taking immediately when

the e-file is still closed

which makes it a little bit harder to

attack um so

so so hopefully this gives people a

little bit of a sense of how how people

analyze it

at a high level now once you create the

file you memorize it right if you're a

gm and you create a long file

i mean let me show you an example of

what my file looks like okay and i'm

trying to demystify this

to people because i i hate this this

this entire uh school of thought that

the gm's

you know do this abracadabra like magic

i do the same stuff that you guys might

do i just do it maybe at

a slightly deeper level but that doesn't

mean you know i'm doing anything special

so if you just give me a second i'll

find a

non-compromising file that i that i have

made

and um okay so

i i will reveal some of my preparation

here which is okay

which is okay uh this is my file

all right oh i know where i know where

to find some of my files that i can show

you guys if you just please bear with me

for one moment

um and i know people might be excited at

this

but i want to open something that

doesn't feature anything

that anybody else recommended to me

because that would be unfair to that

person

yes i found it here it is there we go

okay so let me show you a file from 2015

and i was already a gm so

it's it's not like this is that old

so let me just replace this

all right okay there we go i need to

make this a little bit smaller so you

can see everything

okay

so this is my file on the

chigorin which is an opening in the rye

lopez

and i'm analyzing this from black's

perspective so trigoran is one of my

main lines

um and uh i this is the official file

that i made

uh from black's perspective in the

trigorin and you can see it's just a

chess-based file it's also

can be transferred into a pgn file this

is the chigorin by the way it's the line

of the rylopa as the black and play

uh and you can see a couple of things

here you can see that uh i'm i'm

inputting a lot of text

and the reason that i input text is that

when i'm reviewing the file

five years later uh i i want to know

why certain moves are played i don't

want to re-go through the process of

determining

why certain moves are made i want all

ready for that to be explained

so that i don't have to constantly

redetermine what the ideas are

you can see the d5 the old main line

okay that's good to know which means

it's probably not going to occur as

often now

blah blah blah and not the most popular

move so you can see

and in these positions i'm making a long

text note

really to explain the ideas so i'm

saying this is my recommendation it

might trigger and file for white almost

everyone takes on d4 automatically

leading to a typical e4 d6 pawn position

which blocks excellently coordinated

pieces

and the better this is written the more

easier it is to read five years later

you don't want to look at a file and for

it to have some sort of crappy text that

you wrote in two seconds you want to put

a lot of effort

into this stuff uh and and one thing

that i would do is if i were to go

through this with modern stockfish

i would see that there are some mistakes

because computers have gotten stronger

and i would update this if i haven't

updated it

but you can see that my main line goes

through move 34.

uh and i know that may seem impressive

but it's not that i want to do this it's

that i have to do this

because this is how deeply people

analyze nowadays

and it ends in equality which is of

course what we want to do if we're

playing black

and and this is just a an example of one

such file

um i'm not a specialist in the opening

so i don't have

as many as i should and i haven't

updated them as diligently as they

should

thank you badour uh when we got a whoa

we got a fifty dollar donation from

this is incredible badur jabava is not

only

in the chat but a 50 donation from grand

master bharat or jabba i was going to

show you my jumbava variation file

um and uh that's a little bit recent so

i didn't want to leak that

but badour with 50 bucks uh and

wishing me happy birthday and honor to

have him in the chat

and to have him watching my stream

really so thank you so much for

a huge privilege to have so many strong

players in

in my chat consistently uh thank you so

much

and nicola with 2 000 bits as well thank

you

i can't even keep up with this okay um

and badur of course recently has started

to stream he's he's awesome

uh fymit thank you for the prime

and uh this is amazing thank you so much

uh everybody

okay so back to the speed run because i

know everybody's excited to continue

i think you get the point this is what

opening analysis looks like i went in a

little bit of a tangent there but

hopefully people find this

you know find this helpful um

yeah definitely zay-z i'd consider it

the reality is

the more you memorize the better uh and

the more you understand the better there

is no

limit or like target that i that i reach

when i'm trying to memorize files i'm

trying to memorize as much as i can

but hopefully this shows you guys why

chess is a full-time occupation

they don't show this in the queen's

gambit okay when beth walks in to play

borgob or whatever

and they did this the same the way in

the old days and they just had files

that they would write down in notebooks

it's the same analysis

i wouldn't be as extensive but it would

was the same process

and this is the non-glamorous part of

chess work that nobody

really appreciates entirely i think and

i don't mean this in an accusatory way

but but the reality is uh this is not a

glamorous process it's very very

cumbersome it's very boring at times

if you think i'm not bored out of my

mind when i'm you know sitting with

stockfish for 10 minutes letting it sit

and think about a sort of boring

position that may never occur

of course it's incredibly boring for me

but it's necessary work if you want to

get better

so just wanted to give people a window

into how this stuff works
