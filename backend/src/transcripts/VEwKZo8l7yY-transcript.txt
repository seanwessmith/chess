okay so let's play the c3 sicilian which i've been advocating uh four players of really all levels it's a great opening and he immediately plays d6 allowing us to control the center uh takes d4 which is not a great move and the reason why is because he allows our knight now to access its natural square on c3 this is the alpine situation so nothing extraordinary we should just continue developing and if he goes bishop g4 we have a trick that i've already illustrated in a slightly different context it's happened once or twice oh g6 i mean he's really playing with fire here taking his time to develop the pieces so there's probably speaking two approaches we can go for his throat we can start pushing our pawns in the center hoping that good things are gonna happen uh white is not winning by any means or we could develop sort of old school let's do the old school approach now black now wants to develop the bishop to g4 so what should we do about that this is not a move that i play lightly because it is kind of spending a tempo but it's a very good idea to restrict the development of his bishop i see a lot of people just playing h3 out of general considerations but you shouldn't do that you should only play h3 um if if there's a specific reason to end it now bishop c4 here would be a very typical mistake um why is bishop c4 a mistake and where should we put the bishop instead who can tell me we've seen this several times before not knight a5 it runs into knight takes e4 and d5 i'll show that after the game and so we can develop the bishop to d3 or to e2 i'm just going to go out to d3 in order to lend some reinforcements no probably goes knight b4 not a problem we can just drop back to e2 and look at this knight on before it may look nice but we can always just chase it away with a3 so it's not that i've lost the tempo it's almost like we have both lost the tempo um but i don't mind my bishop on staying on e2 so i guess the joke's on him now we don't want we don't necessarily need to go a3 immediately that that knight is not causing any damage to us i want to make that point very clear i see a lot of players they look at a piece like this and just because it's on our side of the board they think it's dangerous well a knight alone is not going to cause any trouble because there's no targets on the queen side right we could have also played d5 to try to remove the escape square from the knight and threaten to win it with a3 but there's a reason i didn't do that um and i'll show you guys why after the game okay so he closes up the center and goes 94. what should we do here a key question obviously should we take the knight yes or no and don't try to read my lips you know i don't ask a question for the answer to be something specific we actually should now there's a drawback to this mode which is very clear which is that if you look he now has a very nice outpost for his knight but here's the thing look at this pawn on e4 how is he going to defend it he's not so he's losing a very important central pawn uh now you guys might be like wait a second can't he defend it with bishop f5 or queen d5 he can but that's purely temporary both of these moves can be dealt with very straightforwardly if bishop f5 we can go out to g4 chasing the bishop prying it away from the ledge if queen d5 yep we could have gone bishop c4 and done the very same thing to the queen now it is true that we have weakened our king side and i've talked about the situation right where you have to make certain concessions at this level uh in order to make other gains that's just part of the process and you have to make the judgment call when it is worth to do something like weakening our king and here why have i judged that it's okay because uh two things first of all black has no pieces really on the king's side and second of all i've got all of this beef over in the center so i'm really not worried um so what should i do now should i take on e4 and there's some really cool tactics that that that arise here so we can play a3 but actually i can't take on e4 and this is a very important moment tactically speaking hopefully he takes on a2 to allow me to demonstrate why i believe this is a good move um let me just write this down in case he doesn't so he trusts me so after the game i'll be able to explain that okay so now we need to kind of figure out what our priorities are well first of all knight c2 i wouldn't say that it's really a threat because well because the bishop is protected in fact we kind of want him to take our bishop so let's let's clarify the situation a little bit let's bring our pieces out onto better squares uh and let's force him to just uh you know decide what he wants to do so that can be done with a move a3 i'm not doing this to defend the pawn i'm doing this to ask the knight a question where is it going to go um i don't want him hanging over me if that makes sense right if he goes knight c2 i'm just gonna go rook c1 he takes my bishop no problem i'll take back of the pawn now what benefit does white have from this trade why does this trade actually benefit white i mean doesn't it weaken my king even further doesn't it ruin my pawn structure we've talked about that first of all it opens up the effo but i want you guys to notice one more thing it and that is the center we talked about this on several occasions right optically you look at the pawn structure you say yeah you know three pawns in the center two of them doubled not good but if you look at it another way they all defend each other it's like a big conga line and that's the best kind of center to have okay so that's why i'm always preaching about not jumping to conclusions in regards to pawn structure and what it looks like it might look ugly uh but it might contain you know a good heart so let's see what he does i mean his knight is hanging he can okay so he takes he acquiesces and the other good thing is that if rook takes c1 queen takes c1 we couldn't have done this earlier because this pawn would have been hanging but now the e3 pawn defends it so so we're in very good shape okay so he's gone bishop d5 uh he attacks our knights we can we can move the knight but we can also keep the knight in the center which is an idea that i like how can we keep the knight in the center we need to defend it what do we defend it with we can defend it by bringing our bishop out to f3 deploying it to a nice diagonal keeping the knight centralized and creating this bishop standoff now remember when we see a standoff we need to assess immediately the sort of weakness of this bishop this bishop is a type two undefended piece it's defended only by the queen this queen could easily be removed so i'm immediately looking for discovered checks such as knight f6 check in fact i need to consider knight f6 here and wait a second i'm connecting the knots for a second knight f6 immediately is possible but that's not the best move here's what we can do we can take on passant and now who can tell me what white can do rook takes ca queen takes it and now just as the doctor ordered just as we talked about i takes f6 check we win a second pawn and now we have a full center of black has no pawns there two extra puns and we're completely winning in the end game rook takes f6 okay so i know that opposite colored bishop end games have a reputation for being quite drush not entirely justified i mean if you're up two connected passers that doesn't you know i'm not worried that there's obstacle bishops but what should we do how should we proceed here it's actually not that easy i need to think for a second myself okay so boom i'm calculating a variation okay so what we need see i thought about queen f3 uh but but it allows queen c1 check so e4 is the very classic move but e4 weakens the d4 square okay i don't really like that idea so here's what i want to do i want to contest the c file i want to contest the c file how should we do that well actually what i'm going to do first is is move the king out of the way okay i'm going to go kg2 my idea is that now i can move my queen out of the way and if he gives me a ch and queen c1 is no longer going to be a check so this is actually not easy to to figure out a way to plane but i'm going to go queen f3 and here's the whole idea queen c1 is the move he would have formerly had forking the king and the pawn now he doesn't have it now he can check me on c2 but i would have easily covered that okay let's freeze his pawns on the light squares so that later we'll be able to attack them with a bishop five gifted thank you so much tree poker i really appreciate it excuse me i really appreciate it so what is our plan here our plan is just to very methodically very carefully push our past pawns particularly the e pawn and this is the whole idea the queens are at a standoff the queen trade is obviously just losing for black because in addition to everything else we can go after these pawns that's why we froze them now we go e4 and e5 very carefully and what we can also do is okay so e5 here would blunder the bishop how can we defend this bishop in an active way while also freezing his position basically queen f7 is what i was thinking actually the problem is you can go back to c8 but then we can drop our bishop to b3 and cover the c2 square okay now we can go e5 and we are simply winning we can let's actually move our king in closer to the center now we switch roles right the king defends the bishop which means the queen is free to move and it also means that we can go e6 and let's go bishop c6 and let's prepare the queen trade on e8 first we can push the pawn out now we can go queen e8 and the game is over because even though he succeeds in blockading these pawns now i go around and i take all of these funds and be four pawns up in the end not an easy game these guys are good okay these guys are good and they resist well but i think positionally that was that was a nice game okay so let's quickly walk through what happened now c3 sicilian right d6 is not the best move although i've played it myself with black you need to know what you're doing here and the move here is not f6 uh remember can somebody remind me why is c takes d4 conceptually speaking not a great way to play ah dominique myers wait why are you not vip dominique myers needs to be vip i'm gonna make him blush okay gives white the big center but not only that there's something very specific guys very specific look at this knight where can this knight now go okay the c3 that is a big development square for the knight if he keeps the pawns here at least this knight can't develop to c3 while d2 is a relatively clunky uh clunky movement you got a choice well then i might ban you okay so by the way the cool trick if he had gobbleshop g4 we can go d5 and if he goes 95 what very common idea does white have who knows this idea it seems like we can't move the knight because the queen is pinned but remember the only pin in which you actually can't move the pin piece is a pin against the king boom boom check knight d7 is forced to avoid checkmate and in the end of the day white is going to be up a full piece there's many openings where this kind of stuff occurs i would say most famously in the queen's gambit my brother played a game um years and years ago he was 1500 and he actually taught me this trick where you go knight pd someone oh no i blunted the pawn oh my god i can't take that oh joke's on you and i takes d5 and checkmate to the queen because this is forced and black is up a piece for a pawn poop male rock thank you for gifting to bed woofer uh so there's i can give you a million examples of this okay so he didn't do that h3 to stop bishop g4 and aichi for e3 bishop d3 just developing now if bishop c4 knight takes e4 and d5 and mark veretzky one of the most famous chess coaches of all time unfortunately passed away a couple years ago and he was known for training very strong players but he made a recommendation if you're very serious about chess improvement i would actually potentially recommend doing this i know it's very clunky and it's very time consuming if you can start a notebook just like a real physical notebook uh or you can do it on the computer and what you want to try to do is collect tactical themes okay i know that sounds weird let me explain tree poker thank you for the dear yo ten two one subs big boy donut right there tan tier one subs from tree poker thank you so much basically you collect tactical things so every time you play a game and either in analysis or in the game itself you've noticed some sort of cool tactical idea that you think might be generalizable such as this one or such as this one you basically note it down in your document right or in your notebook and you can describe it however you want beretzky recommended actually printing out for even before printers literally drawing on this notebook the diagrams or cutting them out with scissors every time you saw one in a book and then you would revisit that notebook and you would have all you know in front of you a very extensive list of tactical themes that occur in your games which you can learn and review thank you shapes for the prime okay uh what is a notebook a notebook is is something that you write and i still like handwriting i hand write everything so i hand write notes from the speed run and that's it anyways back to the game so this is all very simple okay um that comes later so takes takes knight t2 right does this make sense guys now the pawn is weak if he goes queen d5 we would go bishop c4 get out of here now what if he goes f5 what do we do what do we do if he goes f5 oh i can show it after the game yeah what is writing sorry for the chewing trick question fork what do you check when you fork two pieces whether one piece cannot move and defend the other piece knife d5 defends against the check if you go bishop c4 black and defend the knight with e6 always check for that okay when you have a fork unless it's a night fork in a night in the situation of a night fork the two pieces literally cannot defend each other by definition if you have a fork with anything but a knife then if you think about the meth one piece could slide over to try to defend the other piece particularly a fork where you check the king and another piece can that other piece move aside and block the check thank you doctor lono for gifting look at that 2am hive jpy gifting five to the community thank you so much this is ridiculous so you would take on poisson and with the pawn okay he played here we dislodged the bishop take the knight take the plum force the knight to decide create a massive pawn center and what else was important in the game and there we go as soon as we make this move stand off oh that might be in the notebook as well bishop on d5 type 2 undefended peace defended only by the queen can we dislodge the queen yes we can we can take his rook he should have taken my rook to keep his queen firmly in control of the bishop on d5 oh no not again not again it's bobby boucher getting five stops to the throw community water on the fire what did you start tree poke or another five thank you poppy boucher so much um well bishop d3 wouldn't create the standoff right this would be like bishop opposition but curious chimpanzee gifting five subs to the community holy spokes oh my goodness what are we doing ladies and gentlemen why couldn't knight take oh yes thank you for reminding me why couldn't the knight take on a2 great question okay so let's unpack this for a second right now just to remind you guys from yesterday type 1 and type 2 on defended pieces a type 1 undefended piece and this is my designation is a piece that is literally not defended by any other pieces think of the one crow for the 500 okay a type 2 undefended piece is a piece that is defended by exactly one other piece and my point here is that type 2 undefended pieces are a lot more vulnerable than people realizing so the move here would be queen to a4 we're trapping the knight the knight is no way back and we're threatening to capture it getting us two pieces for the rook which is huge if he goes b5 we can just slide the queen back to a3 and once again the threat of rook takes a2 is completely unstoppable he can try to call queen d5 but i mean look at how many threats now we create here this is just horrible for black thank you good night okay now if he goes bishop takes a2 then by the same token we can play the very typical bishop b3 just trapping the bishop and then queen d2 to pick off either the knight or bishop well how did i notice that well i guess my subconscious indicates that when the knight is on the on the rim like this particularly when the knight is you could also go in ic5 by the way but the knight is is you know so far away from black's other pieces and it's on the rim that sets off the metal detector right because just mathematically speaking the knight only has three potential squares two of them are covered one of them is uncovered so we need to bring the square under control but we need to do it in such a way that we also reinforce you know ideally the attack on the knight and that's why queen a4 is played thank you mr luxies keeps the hype going with a sub appreciate it um knight on the rim is dim that's right okay so a3 chasing away the knight well again be careful about the generalizations and here we have a discovery to win the pawn now i think a lot of people would uh would go knight d6 here thinking ah i can attack the queen and win the bishop but same exact principle the queen can move away and simultaneously defend the bishop you gotta be careful about that okay so here we have a very simple position where where two pawns up both of them are passed queen f3 here was the tempting move but he has queen c1 check super nasty check for king the pawn on b2 which i kind of hate so that's why i play king g2 so that now queen f3 doesn't allow the check on c1 it's a preparative prophylaxis actually and the rest is simple b4 fixing the pawns on the same color of our bishop now um i actually disagree kind of with a piece of advice that chess coaches and books often share about pawns and bishops let me turn the lights on all right made it dark but it's a little too dark now what exactly do i disagree with i think that the prevailing wisdom is that you're supposed to or so the uh the sages right that you're supposed to put pawns not on the same color square as your bishop right and i actually think the efficient sort of effectiveness of that is limited because there's so many exceptions to that rule there's so many times when you do want to put your pawns on the same color of your bishop now the way that i recommend to think about it is oftentimes you want to make sure that your opponent's pawns are on the same color as your bishop and you want to make sure that they're fixed on those squares because they're easier to attack so here for example it doesn't really matter where white's pawns are it happens that they're on the dark squares but that's not the important part the important part is that black's pawns are on light squares fixed can't move and so the bishop can easily attack them it's low-hanging fruit just a way to think about it you guys can mull this over if it helps okay queen f7 couldn't go e5 by the way because of queen takes d5 check and now we bring our king into the game it's the end game e6 couldn't have gone e6 before bishop c6 d5 queen eight trading the queens the funny thing is if not for these pawns it would be a draw because white wouldn't have any way to make progress uh yeah i can play the karaoke okay that's actually a very important point it's only because of this idea that i'm winning i can show you guys a million examples of opposite colored bishop and games where i can even find probably a game of mine where the pawns were arranged exactly in this way or something similar and there is no win because it's a blockade paddle bro let me see what i can find give me a second please the danish is interesting it's not very objectively good but it's a very good weapon for for beginners and intermediate players hard to play against in a blitz game let me see what i can find guys give me a moment please thank you guys for all the subs and the support as usual yeah i found a good example okay so here is okay let me just find it here and let me show you guys a very instructive example from one of my games i was able to trick a very strong player precisely along these lines and this is to show you guys why opposite colored bishop end games have a reputation as very draw asham games because in very few end games is it the case that you can give up two or even three pawns and still make an easy drop here you go so this is i think going to be really interesting so basically this is a game of mine against julio grande very strong peruvian grand master from 2015 and the following position was reached i'm playing with the black pieces um and clearly i'm in very big trouble i'm down to pawn and look at my king it's wide open but what do you what else do you guys notice about the position what jumps out at you well i've got a pawn on on the f3 uh square but what else what about the bishops what do you notice about them i wanted you guys to notice the fact that there's obscure bishops which is kind of interesting now white is winning here white is winning if he's careful uh because because the the you know the conjunction of black's exposed king with white's past pawns mean that white is in very good shape now the rook on f2 is very safely blockading the f3 pawn it's not going anywhere but my opponent decided to play queen to d5 asking for a queen trait now i immediately was thinking okay do i want to trade queens or not my first inclination was that if i trade queens i allow him to have connected past pawns which are super scary but then i remembered wait a second this is an opposite-colored bishop end game so maybe i can set up some sort of sudden blockade and then i realized that i could and the way that i do that is by trading rooks rook g2 now he had foreseen this he goes bishop to b6 defending the rook king b7 chasing away his bishop and then i go bishop e4 i basically forced this pawn to move what is the idea isn't this good for white it's not and here's why now look at the position i have full control of these two squares and that means that these pawns intimidating as they may appear are never actually going to go forward and even though white can send his skin forward why can't he even win the f3 pawn which he does he goes around and i just give that pawn up does it matter because i've got complete blockade over these two pawns and this pawn is on the light square so i can always if need be defend it with bishop c4 and here we go that's it he can bring his king to f6 all he wants doesn't matter just chill with my bishop on the right square okay so that's what you have to be very careful about in opposite colored bishop end games a scenario where you can win several puns but it ends up not mattering because of the blockade here we have a very similar position but the threat of bishop b7 allows me to vacuum up the rest of the bonds okay next game [Music]
