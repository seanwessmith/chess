[Music] so okay let's go e4 well it's not it's an office okay so he plays the perk and i've sort of ranted about not recommending the perk to people and hopefully i'm gonna demonstrate why that is uh so he can play e5 here okay that's the philidor that's that's a version of the philidor and a lot of people don't understand in this position why is it that white doesn't take on e5 and then we can take the queen forces king to lose castling rights the problem is when you've traded queens the king losing its castling rights it just isn't as as powerful as when the queens are on the board so d takes e5 is a move but we're just going to keep developing with knight f3 which is the main line then we're going to develop okay so he takes we're obviously going to take with the knight and there are several ways that we can go about playing this position we can we can go for long castles we can go for short castles the way that i like to play this is actually to put the bishop on d3 to lend some more reinforcements to this pawn on e4 that's our only central pawn so it makes sense to develop our pieces in a way such that we keep the spawn protect now what should we do with the night should we take it should we drop our night back what do people think this is actually quite an instructive moment so i actually think we should not take it and after the game i will explain exactly why i believe that now both moves are fine we're dealing here with marginal differences but i do think it's an instructive moment in decision making we're going to drop our knight back and then continue developing the basic of it the long and short of it is that by taking we give him more pawns in the center and we help him uh orchestrate something like d5 which here would not be possible now the reality is we've got a bigger share of the center than our opponent does which means white is slightly better and we've got very free development so after the game i'll show uh some more reasons why i didn't take but quite an instructor now how should we go about expanding in the center we can of course develop our bishop but we don't actually always have to do everything strictly by the book we can start expanding a little bit in the center and on the king side we've developed enough pieces to where this is fine uh we can deal with this bishop a little bit later we don't always have to you know complete our development by the book at this level uh you've got to be able to improvise a little bit and and know when to do something a little bit more ambitious and he's developed relatively passively so we can afford this uh you know especially so rook e8 now a couple of things that we could do here right we could push this pawn to f5 now the downside of that mode is that we would give him the e5 square for his knight that's a very nice central outpost um so in this kind of situation it's a good idea to make a general improving move now what does that mean first of all bishop e3 is absolutely possible but i'm thinking of a slightly more aggressive move let's look at this queen for a second it's just sort of sitting there on its initials can we put it on a on a nice little square where it's controlling both yeah good job guys queen f3 is exactly what i'm thinking about bishop e3 might have walked into knight g4 which would have been a slight tiny bit nasty so you'll see this very often f4 followed by queen f3 is a typical idea what we're basically doing is is we're waiting for him to show his cards right he might play d5 and then that'll that'll help us understand how we want to play this uh but there are certain positions where you don't know exactly how your opponent is going to arrange his pieces there we go see now there's clarity to the position we know that he's he's lost his cool he's lost his patience and of course as as we know we don't want to take here and play into his hands that's why we played f4 we played f4 partially so that we could meet e5 with with d5 with e5 forcing his knight back okay for some reason he just gives up the pawn i don't see what his compensation is going to be now which way should we take on e4 and this is actually a tricky question that i'm asking you guys so both moves are fine now the case to be made for taking with the queen is that we are threatening checkmate but that's actually not the reason that i want to take within the reason i want to take with the queen consists in this move i saw that he was going to play g6 and it looks like this battery has been blunted the aaa battery has run out of power he's going to go bishop f5 but there is a tactical idea that we have here if you notice how strong this battery is can we break through let's go f5 now i'll put it this way guys this is not as simple as it looks he's got what i think is okay so of course he falls for it bishop takes a five we take with a rook this is very typical attacking exchange sacrifice and he simply has no defense to queen takes h7 which is going to be checkmate if he tries to move his king our bishop would come out to h he's probably going to do that would be my guess uh king f8 all of the checks are covered not that they even do anything so it there's actually i think a semi-refutation to the move f5 which was very complex i'll show it after the game he simply resides good now first of all why not take on c6 so there's a couple of things here first of all as i hinted at the during the game do you guys see how even though yes it's true we make more pawn islands yes it's true doubled pawns but you guys know that i always urge you to put pawn structure in proper context pawns may look ugly but they may actually be fulfilling a very important role and now d5 is much easier to to organize and this is just like a bumper on a car you know it's going to be hard for me to to to get past that the other thing is that he gets a b file for his rook so if i ever try to develop my bishop he can tickle me with rook ba and he can potentially either force me to make my rook passive or make the knight undefended and and all these things you know taken together they get annoying so i decided to drop the knife back now why can somebody explain to me why d5 is not possible here or why is it inadvisable and another very typical tactical yeah evil now is correct so ed takes takes and then in the end the queen hangs very typical scenario bishop h7 uh if you've solved your fair share of chess.com problems you should you should be able to recognize this pattern very quickly and if you haven't then well here's your introduction to the discover check and by the way if you've gone d5 with black and your opponent is taken and you have realized that you've just blundered it's not too late to double back right you can go 95 and give up on it's better than putting your head down and stubbornly going for the losing line so f4 queen f3 and players in the 17 1800 rating range have a hard time at times just keeping the tension i've talked about it before what my opponent should have probably done is a move like bishop f8 which is a typical move in these positions dropping the rook back allowing the rook more influence over the center black is slightly worse here black is passive but he's also very solid and it's hard for white to prove anything immediately i would have probably developed the bishop and uh you know the battle would have continued but he kind of lost his cool with d5 knight e4 and actually after f5 what would have been the annoying sequence so instead of taking on f5 does anybody see what else he could have done it's a move that he makes with tempo he could have gone bishop d5 now that doesn't seem like a big problem in and of itself because we can move the queen away but what you should notice here is this rook on e8 there's two things the rook on e8 and the fact that as soon as you play the move f4 you absolutely somewhere in the back of your mind you need to tell yourself okay this diagonal has been weakened so i need to watch for bishop c5 as weird as it sounds you have to make that mental note to yourself very very quick very very early in the process so that you get a better chance to see tactics and if you're alert to that then you'll see knight takes e5 that's not a blunder this puts the queen in the x-ray of the rook and combined with the fact that we played f4 we lose the queen obviously i would not have taken on e5 uh white can play f6 and the attack continues but the position gets a lot more messy than it would have been if we didn't do this so that's actually why if i was playing another gm i would have taken the bishop uh seeing that line because now i'm threatening to win a second pawn and i've just got a very compact position and i'm up upon so basically that's the reason why i think f5 is a little bit objectively dubious and i just verified that with the engine yep bishop d5 was very strong instead he falls for it right bishop takes f5 and after gf we would have played rook takes f5 it's the same exact effect there's simply no defense to the devastating queen takes h7 does that make sense to everybody any questions and please don't be afraid to ask questions i i say this a lot and i mean it every time we're here to learn and i want to make sure everybody is included and it doesn't matter if you're 200 or 1200 uh i you know you should never be afraid to ask anything boring democracy thank you for the sub all right uh perfect uh if king f8 we would have come back here and now let's check me so basically that that's how we would have met that all right well we're 1800 let's continue um let's continue so so far you know i i like the time control even though the games have gotten more complicated they're not like okay 2100 wow okay this is a serious dude never mind it's not a serious dude yeah i think he aborted because we were a little low rated that that happens okay marco 981 damn it would have been a good opportunity but we'll get there we will get there and he plays the modern and we've encountered the modern a lot right the modern is where you fee and kettle the bishop immediately it often transposes into the perk but he plays something called the gurgaons system it's like a cross between the karo khan and the the proper modern black prepares to go d5 there's a lot of ways that we can meet the gurken say but one system which is often very underestimated is to get the bishop to c4 immediately the idea is to stop him from going d5 and this is a very common mistake that people make he simply puts a set as oh let me prepare d5 what has he not noticed here what very subtle move can i make now in order to cement the weaknesses that he's created with this move and i'll show um i'll show a game that really influenced me that's a boom and look at this juice right there he's got to go d5 now we take on passant but now look what's happened as a result his bishop is passive he's still got a weakness on d6 he's brought his queen out early instead of developing his position is just going to be very very cramped he's going to have a very hard time developing naturally so we're going to continue our development of tevarium thank you for the prime we're going to continue our development and in this position if we look at the tension between the knights by playing knight d5 he has relinquished his control over a very nice central square which we can slam our knight into and of course you guys can see that potentially we could access d6 now how should we continue here how should we continue developing actively very typical move it should be on the top of everyone's mind we could play c3 but let's play a little bit more ambitiously let's try to induce f6 which would be a horribly weakening move thank you these nudes for the prime appreciate that 3 a.m support guys loving the energy as we move toward 5 000 subs can't believe it knight f6 okay so he's pinned himself it would be great if we had a chance to apply pressure on the night unfortunately we don't so what we need to do here is realize okay um his position is super passive we need to sort of lay it on and we lay it on by and you guys are seeing this move by centralizing our knight and then look at the disparity in the pc he's got to play age six and he doesn't do it and that's going to cost him tremendously because we need to have what i call a wish list and this wish list right is it has to be updated on every move i want to do this okay and this might not be possible one move but if you keep kind of mulling that wish list over in your mind now you see as a result of us putting in the 995 we can bring the queen out to f3 and his knight is going to simply be lost and once we take the knight okay we just take on f6 the knight is def even if it wasn't defended and he gave up his fiance bishop well thank you for that uh even if we didn't take the queen we would tr we would be able to deliver the lobster instrument well that was pretty simple um but basically his big mistake was was this movie six and uh this is something that you guys should be very attentive to this idea of like cementing these dark squared weaknesses exists across a pretty wide range of openings believe it or not and there was a very famous game uh by tigran petrossian believe it or not against a very competent player where he demonstrated how bad it can be to allow a weakness of this sword game that i was referencing petrossian against pacman it was a grand master and pogman does something very similar to you guys see that he has created these two weaknesses guess what move petrosian plays here pacman didn't realize that he was preparing it by playing rookie one what does petrossian do here he plays e5 exactly same exact thing pachman plays d6 much like our opponent did and you know black has all of these weaknesses now that he's got to deal with and petrossian starts harassing him much like we did you can see the same moves being played knight e5 bishop develops with tempo it's the same elements and petrosian one very quickly so you can see the generalizations that we can make here now if he doesn't go d5 then we can get our knight to d6 that would be even more disastrous but basically we you know we just developed naturally we attack his queen now he should have moved his queen but um now using an idea from earlier in the day we can try to chase his knight away by first moving our bishop back and then advancing our pawn to remove the knight from d5 so he's in huge trouble already but here it was his last chance to go h6 and forcibly uh and the pin although it's still very very bad bishop f6 and queen f3 comes to mind boy oh boy if he has to take this and look at these squares the rook comes in this is absolutely devastating why did you choose queen f3 overnight g4 asks as roseanne yeah so knight g4 i was a little worried about knight pd7 although here we could have gone queen f3 so it was equivalent but the purpose of queen f3 first is if he goes knight d7 we can take the knight um i think you're i think uh we can just tolerate it king kara why is f6 ask snow a new 200 such a weakening move for black well it's just sort of the general effect if you look at this move visually right it weakens the e6 bond it blunts the bishop if he castles there's just going to be more air in front of his king right there's a sense in which he's just just look at this move right everything is everything here just kind of becomes weak and that's all i mean right it's just a visual thing almost and in particular this pawn on e6 is a sitting duck because the e-file is semi-open so when you're judging pawn weaknesses pawn weaknesses are especially disastrous when there's no opposing pawn on the file and which can be attacked so if there was a white pawn on e3 then the pawn on e6 would not be such a big deal but because the rook can come to e1 it has a direct line of fire to the pawn which means that we need to be very careful before we make a weakness like this yeah if he goes g5 i drop it back but all of this creates even more weaknesses you give up the pawn so this never works right when you push pawns like that you almost invariably create too many weaknesses even if you end up winning a piece your position often remains so weak that it's not worth doing it uh just you know just because you won't be able to contain all of the weaknesses as a result let's continue can i play the modernist block sure i i don't i wouldn't mind doing something like that uh showing how it should be played because the modern used to be one of my main openings so i am going to play the modern which i've never done before yeah it looks like this guy's gonna have some connection problems now the modern as the name reveals is a hyper-modern opening hyper-modern openings i remind you they really began in the 1920s when there was a group of chess players that included rehard retsy you know the ready opening and they said you know why is everybody saying that you have to control the center with your pawns i don't think that's entirely the case here's what we're going to do what we're going to do is we're going to let our opponents control the center with pawns then we're going to attack those pawns from a distance with pieces that we put on very specific sheltered positions it's like trench warfare we're going to put a bishop on g7 we're going to feed and get of that bishop we're going to you know we're going to provoke all these moves and then we're going to attack that center with our pieces that's the sort of rationale behind the hyper modern openings thank you hydro cow the prime yeah this guy is having bad connection and okay i'll give him a draw uh i offered him a draw i obviously don't want to take his rating given his internet he's declined it okay well i guess in that case we'll have to play um yeah i'm not sure why he declined it i think he didn't see it so well what do you what is the point of jesus well the point is is to do what's called a fianchetto that's an italian term which means to deploy the bishop on the longest diagonal on the chessboard and you can understand right just intuitively that the bishop controls mathematically speaking more squares when it sits on the long diagonal and in addition you can see that even though he's occupied the center our bishop now immediately applies pressure on that pond so now we have to develop our pieces in such a way as to apply consistent pressure on his center while also developing our pieces in a healthy fashion that's a hard thing to do which is why modern's a hard opening to play well okay i'm sorry he lost on time so we're just going to have to move on thank you for the sub with zako91 okay moving on hopefully we can oh we're playing he dog so we'll play another modern uh and and let's see if he goes e4 to transpose if not we'll play the king's indian uh maybe i should have just started with the kingston so he plays the london system and i'm going to play the king's indian setup against the london system to show you guys how to deal with it with the king's indian setup i know he can play e4 and i'll explain later the transpositional issues now the thing is here the thing is interesting we haven't developed our knight to f6 and we can actually use that as a good thing why is that a good thing because it might be easier for us to prepare the move e5 striking in the center now we can't play e5 immediately because he's got one two three defenders on the square and we've got only one two attackers how can we prepare the movie five and how can we prepare it in such a way that after e5 d e we don't allow a queen trade knight d7 that's a very typical king's indian move it's more common than going knight c6 because knight c6 keeps that line of negotiations open between the queens which might result in us losing castling rights after we go e5 now we can go e5 yeah you can play c5 in these positions too but it's more king's indian need to go for the e5 pod break that's more principled now a couple of things right first of all let's not go knight f6 because that would blunder the pawn but we still need to develop the knight and we need to be very careful about how we do this uh one option is to develop it to e7 another option is to reinforce the pawn on e5 preemptively and then deploy the knight to its traditional square on f6 how can we deploy how can we defend this pawn preemptively and i don't want to hear anybody say f6 because you know where that leads we can play queen e7 actually we're following i think a game that i played in 2013 exactly in this position so now we keep our options open maybe we'll play knight h6 knight f5 as uh as one person suggested it depends what he does okay so he's allowed us to go knight f6 which means we will uh it's not this isn't like that theoretical but i've i've definitely seen games like these before so now we have a nice compact position pawn on e5 is protected and uh well we'll we'll see what he does but um i mean for white you know he needs to also complete his development so he's probably thinking about where to put this bishop no i don't plan to castle queen said that would be a little bit too much uh because that would involve me fianchettoing the other bishop it would be interesting but let's play it more traditionally by castling now um obviously we have the question of this bishop what should we do with this i just mentioned it but what should we do with this bishop how do we develop it because remember if we move this knight uh we might drop the pawn on e5 we don't want to do that and that's where the fiance is so good fianchettoing is really good when the bishop can't develop along it's sort of main diagonal because there's some sort of traffic right or there's a piece that cannot move that's where fianchettoing comes in so double fianchetto both bishops are fianchettoed crisscrossing the board i kind of like those types of setups knight h5 was possible for sure there's different ways to play this position we're doing it in a more traditional way we're sort of developing and there's nothing wrong with that but you could also play it a little bit more creatively so the movie e4 would be a very instructive mistake and i'll explain why we actually might be almost following that game i played in 2013. i'll show you guys what i mean so the move e4 yeah would have been a little bit weakening okay um welcome to all 3000 you'll be finishing in about 15 minutes though so where do we go from here what's going to be the plan of action well it depends on what he goes h3 again no need to reinvent the wheel let's simply identify pieces that are not doing anything and bring them into the game exactly rook d8 is a start and while we're doing it right and we don't want to go rookie though rook e would be unnecessary because we have enough defenders on the pawn already or do we because here's the thing if we look at the position carefully right you guys can see that we're occupying this d file so wouldn't it be nice if we could move this knight out of the way so that the rook could actually do something on that d-file well there's a problem if we move the knight immediately we drop the pawn on e5 that's a problem we've already ran into so we need to solve that problem before we move the knight from d7 and some of you have already suggested ways that we can do it we can go knight h5 exactly the point is of course we want to take this bishop and ruin his structure but the main point of this move is to open up the bishop's defense of the pawn now we can go knight c5 now we can go knight c5 and we can allow our rook better control the d5 it shouldn't blood my bishop but but but again uh sometimes the position gets complex and not every one of your pieces will be ideal uh but you can see that we're sort of opening up our controller but this bishop is super nice it's sort of really sizzling through the board it's it's it's a good bishop and um isn't the bishop still pressure well yeah our bishop is defending a very important central part remember i've said this many times one of your pieces or more can be performing a defensive role there's nothing wrong with that so we have several ways that we can go about he's actually made a mistake he's blundered upon now what knight f1 has done if we look at all of our pieces what has he allowed us to do what has he allowed us to do absolutely and we don't do this to ruin his spawn structure we do it to ruin the pawn structure because his king is there and now we have a fork it's a very unusual fork how do i find it undefended pieces you should always be looking out for them this is an undefended piece and pawns are included in that equation so we see several weak bonds have been created as a consequence of the trade and combining these observations the bishop and the pawn queen to h4 comes to mind attacking the bishop attacking the pawn that's a pretty disastrous loss for him because his king is going to get caught in the crossfire okay so it's not only important as a standalone concept to look for undefended beats but particularly when there's been a big time trade right when you've ruined a structure like this you should expect that there will be new weaknesses that are created which might be the subject of a fork so you exploit a previously undefended piece and something that's just been created bingo let's take the pawn and now we're going to hatch a plan to continue the king side attack obviously we're attacking on the king's side so knight g3 um well if we take the knight well there's no need there's no reason not to take the knight let's let's clear up some of the tension here so we can better understand the situation and now we need to find a way to as i say add some tabasco sauce to the king's side and tabasco sauce can come in various forms it would be nice if we had a rook left so we really don't have a rook lift because there's too much pawn traffic so that leads us to the thought well okay if there's pawn traffic we might as well use our pawns and so the move f5 comes to mind right we just drive the spot to f4 we clear some of that pawn traffic let's get our queen back first and that opens up the potential for a rook lift through f5 thank you rasheed appreciate the five months man okay so he stops us in our tracks question you ask yourself immediately when a pawn is pushed like this what weak squares have been left behind and also there's there's many ways many ways in which we can go about this e4 very nice guys good observation skills but um i'm going to show you guys a slightly different approach which is to use your pawns as battering rams right this pawn and f4 looks like it's solid as a rock but what can we do to try to get this pawn out of the picture so that we can then go f4 and continue the attack it's a typical idea g5 is absolutely correct now what makes me think that i can get away with such well this isn't even really a sacrifice if he takes on e5 after f4 just intuitively you should realize that with a king like this there's just no way he's going to survive we could trade queens here that wouldn't be the worst idea but obviously we want to end the game with a checkmate so we're going to drop the queen of g6 onto a square word x-rays the king i didn't just choose a square random now we don't even need to play a four we can collect the pawn first uh no need to rush with that with that move now we can go f4 right so so when you can collect the material back there's no need to force yourself to sacrifice okay he gives us a check now the problem is going to be that if his bishop moves away from g3 what move are we going to have to end the game well and hopefully our opponent will allow us to show this of course we go f3 typical lobster pins or idea winning the other bishop with checkmate and that's over he's got to give up this bishop and the attack rage is on and uh yeah the game is over so one simple idea really did it in yep f3 okay so again we don't need to rush to take the bishop uh let's actually bring some more beef to the g-file okay now we have to take it okay let's just simplify now notice that there is a line of fire to uh to the king so we can just take a bunch of this stuff okay he's threatening bishop e5 so let's cover that and checkmate with the knight sorry i had to go a little bit fast in the end okay that was an interesting game so here let's actually compare uh that game i referenced uh that game i referenced you guys from 2013 let me see if i can find it all right so basically um yeah actually it was exactly the same thing this position was reached in one of my games and and he went c3 so very very similar as you guys can see queen e7 literally oh my god i think this was the exact same position yup so with the difference that my opponent had his bishop on e2 and e dog had his bishop on c4 so literally i did exactly the same literally exactly the same stuff and i did go e5 and get my knight to d3 so you can see that if you if you take your game seriously you can learn from them and you can apply them directly to you know to your blitz scheme so i had an inkling that that was what i was doing but i didn't remember how similar it actually was uh so in any case b6 defean kettle the bishop but basically everything we did was was very much uh very much straightforward and e49d3 becomes an idea here it's exactly what we practiced for and knight f1 was the big mistake so edog could have considered b4 attacking the knight now what nice tactical move does black have in this position yeah so i don't know if you guys mean g4 or b4 we'll consider both so b4 attacks the knight we don't automatically move our knight we ask ourselves can we counter attack one of his pieces we actually can what move can we play bingo e4 we attack his knight if he moves his knight we have knight d3 and if he takes twice much like in my game we have c5 winning the night number one number two if he takes his knight um our knight then we take his and this pawn is like a flamethrower right it's it this pawn is going to disappear but it's going to take a big chunk of the king side security with it and this check comes white's position is completely devastated not to mention we can just win back the pawn if we want it what does the computer say your accuracy was 99.9 i don't think so um my accuracy if you're curious was no no definitely not 99 95.7 good but i'm sure some inaccuracies were committed now if he goes g4 then that just creates a huge weakness i mean look at how much it weakens his king we can just drop our knight back and uh even if we give up the pawn that doesn't matter because we've already done actually we have a tactic here oh black is a very pretty tactic here noticing that this knight is overloaded what can we do to it now if we take the knight then the other knight replaces it but that's what should set your brain emotion aha what if we take that other knight queen takes we take this knight if the knight takes then we take the bishop we've got two pieces for a rook and a huge attack so basically well queen h4 was a fork takes get these pawns back g5 using the other pawn as a battering ram trying to dislodge the f4 pawn right and uh we could have absolutely gone 94 as well trying to get a rook to d2 many roads lead to rome here and uh it was it was probably just as good if not even better but i wanted to sort of uh you know to go after him more more directly so basically that was what if he had placed the bishop on h4 instead of h2 uh well he he couldn't have done that right because uh because we would have just taken it but maybe there was a different moment oh yeah so he could have gone to h4 in fact he probably should have but here and when you have to deal with a with a situation like this what do you guys think i should cover on f6 with so rob please stop i'm i am active on youtube and let's be productive yeah bishop f6 because the bishop is kind of bad anyway and uh trading that piece is kind of good for us now i know we create a little hole here but at least we've traded off a piece that's sub sub optimal right now some of you guys are looking at this and saying how did i know to play g5 doesn't this weaken my own king and i always repeat the same thing here you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs in chess at some point you have to take risks right you can't have it all against good players you'll have to take measured risks such as yes slightly exposing your own king could this backfire it can has it backfired in my career absolutely but that's just part of the beauty of the game is making those judgment calls okay [Music] you
