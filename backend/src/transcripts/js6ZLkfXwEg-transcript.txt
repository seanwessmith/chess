[Music] well thank you so much anu and we're gonna go e45 we're gonna play classical style of chess um and uh let's go knight c6 all right so let's play the four knights defense this is one of the most common openings at this level and um by the way i will leave time at the very end of the speed run for random questions i will not make detours to answer opening questions he plays the four night scotch so he opens up the center this is an opening that i recommend to a lot of beginners because it opens up the center and it and it basically gives diagonals for both pieces so taking a look at this bishop where can you guys propose that we put this bishop but not but to develop actively and to develop a tempo where can we put this bishop there's two good moves there's two good moves c5 is one which we're going to play and b4 is the other these are the two main moves i play bishop c5 myself at a grand master level bishop b4 is the most popular move okay he's gone bishop e3 now alert alert alert alert he wants to take our knight and when we take back he takes our bishop our bishop is undefended can we move this bishop onto a square where it is defended can we drop this bishop somewhere where it is defended yeah there should be six that's the main move this is the main line actually queen f3 alerts a little bit what has he done what has he done what has he done he has confused something he has hung his knight two attackers one defender boom that's it i'll explain um i'll explain the subtleties of the move bishop e6 after the game okay so he actually is helping us by training um i'm writing all this down okay so he's gone queen g3 now we already know how to respond in such situations we do not get intimidated by a single queen how do we how do we proceed no reason to take the knife we castle beautiful guys there's no reason to take the night yet if he castles okay now he's attacking our bishop now it makes sense to take the knight and not only does it make sense to trade here but it makes sense to do what in this position this comes back to the principle that we do not take pieces at random but if there is a pawn or a piece that's just hanging there and we don't damage our position by taking it we take it now it's going to be very important here guys to develop the rest of our queen side we don't want to spend forever with these pieces and we actually have a really high level move here it's a move that might be a little bit difficult for some of you guys to understand dornev got it now we can drop the knight back and then play d6 but can we kill two birds with one son amazing i'm actually very impressed we can play the move d5 now this move has two purposes the first is to protect the knight the second is to open up a path for the bishop now you guys might say but daniel wait a sec can he take the pawn well that leads to a trait of queens and a pawn is a very small price to pay to trade queens particularly since f2 would be hanging at the end of the line and i'll show that later okay what do we do now we cannot take because the queen is defending what's a good move here guys bishop f5 very good morrigan is on fire getting the bishop out and protecting the knight now he could play f3 and chase the knight away and then we would have to be very careful he goes queen g5 um so let's uh let's defend this bishop shall we let's let's uh make this bishop secure how can we do that no need for queen g5 check let's just go bishop g6 now if he takes on e4 what are we going to take back with if we take on okay he's got here and this is a great opportunity for us to trade some pieces there is a great opportunity for us to trade some pieces here particularly since he's got very active pieces okay so when your opponent has active pieces like this no need to go pawn hunting no need to go pawn hunting let's trade queens how do we trade queens i want to trade queens though i want to show you guys how to win when you decide to trade pieces czechovich chaka ruski's we trade queens we take it but daniel you're blundering upon again it doesn't matter because we're up a piece but he doesn't even take it he goes bishop e5 how do we protect the spawn in the best possible way how do we protect the spawn in the best possible way c6 is beautiful and then we need to find a way to continue now in such situations okay well thank you very much for the bishop see think he's mikhail tal or something what do we do all we need to do now is just bring our pieces in and trade pieces we've decided to trade pieces so let's continue with that particular strategy how do we bring pieces in and trade pieces at the same time rook f to e8 offering a rook trade thank you very much and now we have what's called an open file but before we do anything ladies and gentlemen i want to take care of my future self i don't want any problems with my back rank so why don't we take a second and create a hole for the king i know that rookie 2 would be better but i want to show you guys how to play with an abundance of caution now we can penetrate the second rank okay always do this now let's start taking pawns i'm going to play a little bit faster here because uh we have a minute now here's the thing how are we going to actually win this position a lot of people would continue to take odds but we are already up to pieces guys we don't need to keep taking pods how you win such positions is by identifying a passed upon and pushing it to promotion what is the past pawn that we want to push here what is the most far advanced and in fact the only pass bond we have but we need to get the shortcut of the way first we don't play c5 because we dropped the pawn how do we get the rook out get this goddamn rook out of d4 96 is perfect we don't worry guys remember i i am pretty good at bullets so oh isn't it isn't it great that we played h6 how did i know that we'd one day need this well fantastic that's exactly why you play these moves okay let's push i don't care what he does our king is so safe here it's as safe as can be guess what the knight okay i'm just closing my eyes and pushing the pawn he cannot stop the pawn even if he could we would do this but we just take and uh that's it that's it queen and uh we have checkmate in two moves could somebody please find the checkmate in two could somebody please find the checkmate in two that is correct and that is correct okay all right guys let's analyze now this is the scotch so this is the four night scotch now a lot of people would say and i'll take everyone's questions please be patient a lot of people say wait a second you said that it was a bad idea to bring queens out in the opening and generally it is but there is one key exception when there is no knight on b8 and you can you can rotate this however you want this queen is a lot better than usual because there is no knight c6 possible what about c5 doesn't this attack the queen well it does but what is the drawback of the move c5 this smooth c5 is a horrible positional move and yet a lot of people play it because the queen can even come back to d1 that's not the best move but i want you guys to tell me what this does to black's position look at this juice right here look at this beautiful juicy square that has been now created because the pawn cannot go back to c6 in addition it weakens the d-pawn it weakens the c pawn and there's one more thing i want you guys to identify about the move c5 in terms of black's development what does it actually make more difficult what does it make more it blocks the bishop now the bishop has to go to a very passive square because the pawn is obstructing our own development okay this is exactly what we practiced for that is the reason why we develop our bishop bishop b4 is more popular that is also perfectly legitimate and now the main line goes take stakes bishop d3 this is a theoretical line i won't delve into it i had this in one of my games i played bishop c5 and here it's very very important to always identify the hanging pieces bishop on c5 is undefended um now somebody could say wait a second daniel you talked about intermediate moves why can't we first take the bishop and only after he takes back take the knight well we could except this is a botez gambit this is a botez gambit we have to watch our queen at all times and uh so for that reason we protect our queen now the main line here is queen d2 i've had this again these are these are lines that i have in my own games um it's not like i'm playing special openings to condescend to you guys i practice what i preach i've had plenty of games that went exactly in this way in fact right off the top of my head i can remember one game i played recently uh which continued uh precisely in this manner in a protested game watch this see the gm's do this gms do this stuff too um and this is the main line this game ended in a draw um and so this is the main line white castle's short and black white sorry black castle shore black white castles long and we essentially get a situation where we have attacks on opposite sides of the board that is a situation we have not talked about it yet it's advanced but you guys can understand that generally here black attacks on the queen side and white attacks on the king side and these are some of the most exhilarating lines and positions in chess because we have two attacks and either side is trying to make the other okay but back to reality mom spaghetti back to reality um queen f3 was the move that he played confusing with some other blinds and he hangs the knight and the rest is very simple we castle takes knight blue cole thank you so much for the subway switch i appreciate the support guys and um he goes queen d4 now this is the move that i think some of you guys might have found a little bit puzzling uh which is the move d5 um and um why do we play d5 again i hope people understand jax thank you for the five months that if he trades queens not only can we recapture on f2 but even if we wouldn't be able to this would be very much worthwhile we only give up a pawn and in return we're able to trade queens okay um what else do i have to say about this we could have dropped the knight back and gone d6 but this would have been a little bit slower could somebody explain to me why the move queen takes e4 would not win a piece because it's because of the pin and this is actually something that you would have to pay very very careful attention to yeah we're almost to let's get this to 2000 boys this is close uh but i appreciate all the support it's not quinchify check because the one thing that i haven't pointed out to you guys about the desperado situation is a danger of giving a check like this because now i could remove my queen and defend against the check at the same time i could remove my queen and defend against check at the same time in fact i could counter the check and count her attacker queen this gets very complicated but it's just very simple because there's no more checks and we get our queen out or we trade queens all we have to do guys is take the queen because at the end if we count up the material we have two rooks in white as one we are up a rook yes we're not up a queen but we're up a rook in the end game so for that reason queen takes e4 would not have been possible but if our rook wasn't on f8 we would have to be very attentive to things like that whenever there is an extra here's the principle to remember whenever there is an x-ray between a rook and a queen what is an x-ray a situation where there's a rook on one side of the board and an opposing queen on the other and there's a bunch of pieces that are in the way you have to pay attention to that x-ray because x-ray tactics are among the most easily and most often missed tactics on the chessboard because you don't think that it's significant but this x-ray is super super important we want to be very careful about it okay what about f5 instead of d5 well f5 would not have accomplished the task of also preparing to develop the bishop so it also would have weakened the king so this would have been fine but not great okay so we developed the bishop if he would have gone f3 could somebody remind me where we need to move this knight where do we need to move this knight in order not to give up the bishop we could also by the way give a check on g5 first and move it to f6 but no we need to do that knight d6 defends the bishop and we are fine remember guys there are two ways of broadly speaking of winning a position when you are up a lot of material that means a piece or more option one is to use that extra piece and try to attack your opponent because by definition if you have 11 men on the soccer field and your opponent has 10 it's easier to score a goal the other option is to start trading and to trade queens to trade pieces because at the end of the day if you have only one piece and your opponent has zero that's also very easy to win remember that i went into the intricacies of when one option is better than the other why am i choosing to trade and not try to attack in this position why am i choosing scenario two here could somebody explain to me conceptually conceptually why am i choosing the other option here trade your pieces before you blunder them exactly bingo because both things are protected and also white is very active look at white's pieces they are all mobilized boom boom boom boom i don't want to mess with that okay if i am careless why it's actually going to cause some damage here so for that reason my training pieces i'm disarming white's position i'm making his pieces less active and in general uh just i you know this is just going to be very easy and also because i have open files and i can use these open files to trade a bunch of pieces including the rooks that is sort of the uh the background explanation for why i chose to trade queens in this situation um knight takes f2 would have been possible but pretty complicated simplify the position and the rest is very simple h6 everybody makes everybody understands and here one of the you could take on g2 and take everything but the fundamental way of winning such a position step one identify pass pawn a pass spawn is a pawn that has no pawns obstructing it now the crucial thing to remember here guys a little bit of a course in the end game let's say we have the following position is the h-bond passed is the h-bond passed yes or no more again i could have done either it really doesn't matter yes because it can go all the way to promotion the e-pawn is obviously not passed what if we were to remove the h now the h1 is not passed is the e bond passed is the epon pass now is it passed nope very good you're not falling for it because the f pawn is not on the same file but it is stopping the e bond from progressing but if we were to move this panel as well then the e-pawn is passed because it can move all the way to promotion okay that is the philosophy behind past fonts it's important to just to have that distinction in mind um okay so for that reason we identified the pass pawn and then we identified the obstruction to the past but in this case it's the rook this piece is called the blockader this is the blockading piece so we remove technically the blockading piece and we do not play c5 because that blunders the pawn and we just push that's all i'm doing is pushing the pawn and then we deliver the checkmate very very simple very straightforward no rocket science obviously there is a lot more to it there's different ways of winning positions like that but this is the most classically minded you just identify the pass bond and then you just eliminate the obstructions or you create pass bonds okay if you don't have a pass bond you can create one either by just taking a bunch of your opponent's pawns or by using your own pawns to orchestrate a breakthrough for example here if you wanted to create a pass pawn if for example the d-pawn was not passed you could just like take a bunch of puns and now the fbi would be passed that's also perfectly fine appreciate that dave hammett and let's play one more game any other questions yeah we did have a nice mate that was made in three we also had rook takes a two eliminating the pawn and then mating him on the a file that was also possible why did we play bishop survivor bishop before if we go bishop b6 after bishop e3 we're just moving the same piece twice fantastic question yes we're moving the same piece twice but this is a bit of an exception to the rule because it's okay to move one piece twice we're not moving all of the pieces twice and also this creates tension a standoff between the two bishops aquila pointed out a great point if white takes both pieces what piece do we take back with and what do we gain by taking that piece we take not with the c pawn we take toward the center and look at this we open up the rook so by doing nothing except recapturing we have opened up the rook and given this rook prospect while it stands on its initial square okay so that's another perk of going bishop b6 we have this kind of standoff and black benefits from the standoff if white releases the tension first that is not white's best move white's best move is queen to 200 bits thank you so much okay last two questions i have seen queen's gambit and i've talked about it yesterday i know we'll talk about it again can you show how you would use the open a file i don't know how to actually use the app so you could use it if white castles block if we have a scenario like this okay take a look at this can we take on a2 obviously no we cannot but can somebody propose a plan for getting this knight out of c3 and then guess what once we take on a2 it'll be devastating knight takes c4 is the tactical method we could sacrifice the knight and get the rook to a2 that would be very interesting because we're threatening checkmate but the non-sacrificial way would be just to push the b-pawn to b4 get the knight out of the picture and take on a2 and that's how attacking plans begin that is why open files or semi-open files which this is this is a semi-open file which is which means that there is an opponent's pawn on that file or a piece or sorry just upon but we get the defending pieces out of the way is there a consistent way to create past funds with pawn trades yeah there's pawn breakthroughs and i'll get into that later last question why wouldn't you take with a c pawn over the a pawn is the benefit of opening the file greater but i would argue dolphin that there is no benefit to taking with a c pawn there there is just i mean i don't understand entirely why you would even take with a c pawn right i guess you correct your pawn structure but you also create a very big weak square here okay normally you take toward the center that is one of the key rules toward recapturing that rule has a lot of exceptions i could show you plenty of examples of taking away from the center in fact there are situations that i could show you where a very strong player decides to ruin his pawn structure in order to do something such as open a file so sometimes it is so important to open a file that you would actually you would actually ruin your pawn structure that is a worthy price to pay for opening a file for one of your rooks and one of my favorite examples of that let me show you one moment please is the game between okay no not here uh just please bear with me for a hot second guys i'm trying to find this one particular game i think mama yara was the one who did this so i think definitely mom and dara was involved um yeah tiara was involved i think and he played i think maybe it was a rhonian mummy drop it was a game in the goes in ah come on come on find the position just give me one more second guys please please thank you pretty please it's a rogozin i remember that was a rugosin and this is a really nice example it is worth the wait i promise it was worth the wait if i don't find it with this search then i won't include it at all but i'll find it later all right now that was a different game i was i swear there was carlson against mamidyarov but i don't remember um for some reason i can't remember exactly how this was done um it was a rhonian pram nick maybe it was a rhonian kramnik corolla neritsky that was another game um and if not i will just play the next game guys i know i know i'm taking a while here aronian no aronia kramnik no okay guys i'll find it later the bottom line is that white took on g3 with a pawn rather than taking on h3 i will find that game guys if somebody knows what i'm talking about maybe you can tell me who was playing for some reason i can't can't find the exact uh games i don't remember who was playing i will find it i promise that this game exists but for the time being since i have only 10 minutes left let's play one more game off the instructive speedrun you guys ready for this you guys ready for this um it was carlson mamidyarov i can swear um or maybe carlson aronian the carlson against cerrone maybe mommy dyarv is simply in my imagination last search last search might have been carlson against aronian and then we will do some speedrunning i found it yes amazing i'm really pumped right now i really pumped okay i found it 100 subs charge for seeing this game okay so the bottom line is in this position this is what's called the rogozin variation and after knight takes g3 magnus made a crazy move that was a novelty this position had occurred a million times and white always took h takes g3 okay instead magnus carlsen plays the crazy f takes g3 weakening his pawn opening his king and he does all of this in order to open that f-file because he thinks that one day he's gonna put a rook on f1 by castling and he's going to attack that pawn which is exactly well it doesn't end up happening it doesn't end up happening because aronian sensing that castles the other way but by and large if mag if aronian had basically gone well carlson could have castled and basically he could have gotten the apple long story short it was a crazy move at the time how why would you do that but he won the game so you can see at the grand master level this kind of stuff occurs sometimes you want to ruin your pawn structure and open a file okay let's continue the speed run [Music] you
