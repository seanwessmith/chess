no no not i'm not a rap that's an inside joke 1927. let's go back to the accelerated dragon and he plays the smith mora now i'm not going to take the pawn and this plays back into the psychology of gambit players when you resist their kind of territory uh they get frustrated so what can black do here uh by way of refusing the smith moore what is the best way to refuse it droopy miller thank you for three months we can transpose them to the aleppo and sicilian we can transpose into the aleppo and sicilian by playing knight f6 i'll explain this in greater depth after the game so we've trans literally transposed into the elephant which is also annoying uh which i've played queen takes d4 is the way that most smith moral players actually go here so uh this i actually know very well um well i know not very well i know it decently so you go e6 to defend the knight uh queen takes d4 is a very dangerous line if black doesn't know what to do uh of course i would refer you to mark esterman's amazing book mayhem in the mora and i don't say amazing about a lot of books so it's a labor of love uh mark is the ultimate specialist in the mora you should listen to him rather than me but as far as i know uh the move here is f5 we chase the queen away and now this is the key let me remember so let me actually try to remember my analysis yes so here's the thing white wants to play c4 we go b5 here we sacrifice the pawn in order to get queen side counter play this is still theory and um he doesn't take the pawn and now i think we go either a5 or we can develop the bishop first so let's go a5 continuing to expand and then bishop a6 basically creating that potential skewer against the queen knight to a4 now this one i already don't know maybe i'm still caught in theory let me think about this so he wants queen h5 he wants queen h5 and uh that's got kind of concerning and he also wants to take on d5 can we defend against both threats at the same time well we can drop the knight back to e7 not glamorous but i guess i messed up here i don't know uh this guy this guy out prepared me so um we'll see but that's not the end of the world now we can get our queen to c7 in order to pressure the pawn on e5 all right relax focus grassy we will we will see plenty of 1900s know this much theory uh particularly if um okay so rookie one now uh there's a couple of problems here that we need to solve here uh the first is the problem with this bishop right this bishop is not about but if we go g6 we create holes in our position um that that he can potentially occupy but again it's all about the priorities our top priority here is to complete our development come on may buy hooker by crook we're gonna fianchetto the bishop and then we're gonna try to castle so that i don't get checkmated in the center of the board miss skewer on b4 nope i actually saw that um i did see the move before and he has c4 in response to that so i did actually spot that move but i don't believe it was that good okay so he goes b4 that is a very odd move i i mean i'm not gonna really react to it i'm just gonna complete my development okay so bishop to b2 um now let's unpack this for a second i'm not sure why i can't just take on e5 uh but i'm actually gonna trust him and i'm gonna castle here i'm a little bit concerned that this is still like semi-preparation so i'm just gonna complete my development i think he had some ideas like c4 okay but now i'm not going to trust him any longer what should black do here i mean and let's keep it simple i think that we can now just do what yeah we can just take the pawn you just take and take and i actually um i actually don't see what he has in return for this okay and uh we're up upon we still have this very nice outpost for the knight now this bishop on a6 is sort of dull right but it's got a lot of potential energy especially if we play the move b4 so uh what should we do here how do we prepare the move b4 well there's a couple things to notice here he's attacking the pawn on d5 on b5 he's sort of semi-attacking because if he takes it he walks himself into a very nasty little pin uh but actually i think he can get away with this and i'll explain this after the game so huh this is a complicated situation what i'm gonna do let me think about this i'm going to go queen to a5 the idea is simple i just want to defend the pawn first and then i want to go knight b to d5 i think that this queen is actually going to be very well placed here it's going to put pressure on the pawn which is going to discourage him from bringing his rook into the game yeah i could have moved the other night but then this knight would have gotten uncomfortable okay now we're going to go knight b to d5 according to planet h4 is a good move uh he's he's starting to pressure and massage my king side which is kind of weak so it's time for me to act okay so take stakes and now we're gonna go before opening up the bishop it's a battle on both flanks queen to d2 though very strong move here um and uh my king side is in some trouble here so i'm gonna have to be very careful about it okay he does it so let's just take this pawn let's just get rid of it uh and it does ruin my king side a little bit that is true but here's the thing uh he doesn't have any pieces on the king side yet so it's not like checkmate is imminent uh he can put his queen on g5 but yup he does uh and but but but i can bring my defenders in as well and i want to emphasize that you shouldn't be afraid of moves like these just because they look intimidating because now i've brought my own queen into the game my queen's gonna have something to say about the threat of knight g5 okay so he should definitely not trade queens he's playing very well but i think we'll be able to survive this okay yeah his pawn on e5 is really working in my favor we again have the same situation three pieces biting on the same pawn which is very much to my favor okay what should we do here to complete the defensive operation what should we do to complete the defensive operation we have we aren't done on the king's side we need to get the queen to g6 we need to get the queen to g6 so that knight g5 is is is no longer dangerous because it will not attack h7 okay so rook c1 i'm going to respond to with rook to c8 i'm not going to let him run circles over me get control of the c file also c3 square something we should keep in mind uh for the future potential outpost okay and this guy is just good but uh he's legit so a couple of options here he wants to take on d5 and ruin our structure that it would not be acceptable thing to allow so what should we do what are the options here we could consider f4 that's actually a super interesting move uh but but i don't really want to allow bishop takes d5 so bishop b7 allows his knight to get around to d6 so let's actually go knight to c3 let's use that outpost that we created on the previous move and f4 by the way ripping open the king yeah he made a very strong move here which i sort of semi underestimated um let me think for a second thank you godless for the tier one hmm yeah that's a very nasty move very very nasty move and 92 is possible but then my knight gets passive let's tickle him actually let's go bishop h6 uh let's bring the bishop into the game and tickle his rook i think bishop h6 is actually a very strong move uh and it's a very important move because otherwise my knight was getting undermined very complex game and i love this i'll be able to talk through a lot of concepts after the game but in the interest of time i have to make some moves fast okay now we can bring the other bishop where is the rook going this is the power of having active pieces as goblins with a five gifted keeps the hype going amazing his rook's not going anywhere all of our pieces guarding the rook's potential escape squares okay so he takes on c3 now we don't want to rush to take the rook we can just play b take c3 and uh he's stuck between a rock and a hard place because if he moves the rook then he allows our pawn to push forward and he's gonna have to give up a piece for it which is exactly what's gonna happen he has to give up the knight for it and now we are officially winning we are up a full piece and we still have the potential to rip up in the king's side guys uh please keep the unfounded accusations on the basis of two moves to a minimum um that's not what we're about here uh trust me if somebody actually is cheating i usually have a good sense of it and i will make that known but uh i in you know put yourself in the shoes and i don't mean to lecture anybody here uh we've all gotten paranoid but put yourself in this guy's shoes if you're playing a good game would you like uh you know would you like for an entire community to turn against to turn against you because you happen to know the theory so just common sense justice will be served okay uh so let's lift the rook up to h5 uh you know so okay now we're gonna lift the rook up and this is just gonna be checkmate to the queen and the game is over okay so that's winning um now all right that was a nice move um so uh smith moore now d-tank c3 is the accepted smith mora again i would defer to mark's analysis here in his book um knight f6 so the accuracy i know people are curious uh so the accuracy was probably not too high from my end let's see it's analyzing it just one second jayrud thank you so much appreciate it okay so his accuracy was it was 61 okay so he made a lot of mistakes 88.7 for me uh he played a very nice game let's not take anything away from him uh but you know if you make up your mind after three moves then uh you're not giving the guy a chance thank you thank you tcrh for the 300 appreciate the message so i think that my mistake was the move bishop a6 i think i forgot to play bishop e7 and the purpose behind bishop e7 is to stop the knight from getting to h4 uh and and that's the key move that i missed then you play bishop basics i confuse the move order and very nicely done by him knight h4 uh opening up the possibility for quinn h5 so i had to drop my knight back i had to double it back for completed here he started going wrong with b4 um thanks shark appreciate it um here he started going wrong with before i think he should have gone here and maybe you know chiseled his way into my position here with bishop f6 um and uh that's sort of how i think he should have nurtured the initiative uh well you know i've gotten accused myself and i understand uh that you know definitely people have accused me of cheating and uh fresh freeze and i understand it's a human instinct to get frustrated when somebody's playing well cheating is a huge problem i'm the first person to say that uh but we have to be equitable as much as possible because we don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water there uh crow kaka thank you for the prime and fresh trees as well okay um so and i uh i've shared a funny story before about getting accused i was playing an unnamed grandmaster on icc this was years ago and i had a secret account on icc so i played a cheater and i think i drew him because it flagged him but uh then i noticed that that grandmaster was also playing uh the cheater and i messaged him i was like you're playing a clear cheater oh no i said this guy is a cheater and he said just like you i was like dang girl i'm making his opinions no so i get it but let's move on so anyways we cancel we complete our development went upon now here's the thing knight b to d5 is what people uh is is what uh people were sort of wanting me to do but he takes on b5 and here's the key thing it seems like we're winning the knight on b5 but we're not how can he defend that knight how can he defend that knight yeah this is an authorized speed run account jesse rogers so every people are aware a4 is the move exactly pawns are very good defenders it's an anchor so remember the key principle when you can do something with a pawn you usually should versus doing it with a piece okay so before opening up the diagonal taking the pawn and then getting the queen into the defense okay these are the moves that won me the game queen d a queen e8 these are the moves that a lot of people uh would be unwilling to play i think because they're retreating moves it looks like we've done something wrong uh but the priority here is to get is to beef up our king side security uh contesting the c file now knight c3 was a little hasty but bishop h6 here how did i see this move well i basically i tried to think logically about what's making his position tick what's making his position tick are three things right the pawn which is undermining my pawn the bishop and the rook that's like a mechanism right you can think of that in a vacuum can we try to disrupt that mechanism in some way can we attack the bishop i consider this move this would have been a very reasonable move but i was worried about putting my knight on the rim can we win the pawn i mean no because if we take the pawn we dropped the knight but the rook is a weak lick link and i mentioned this before usually the strongest piece is the easiest piece to attack because it has to respond to most attacks and that's why i settled on bishop h6 he could have shut me down with f4 but that would have created a weakness on g3 then we can go knight a4 and he his queen is kind of tied down to the pawn okay so um yeah i know some people were thinking that and this is just winning yeah if four was possible um what's up logic yeah yeah i know i know i've been yeah um well i'm excited to hear what um what what what this is that you mentioned but uh anyways we've got we've got as if all of the hype wasn't enough we got the man himself in the chat as well um the absolute freaking man in the chat himself okay so um but basically yeah this is just winning for black because the rook is um the rook is just completely trapped what would you say the main takeaway is well first of all um theoretically speaking uh i'm not immune to screwing up in the opening okay i'm not immune bloodline i thank you for the tier one i'm not immune uh to confusing stuff okay and and i did that here so don't think that just because you know i'm a gm or something i know everything about the opening i do stupid stuff all the time but i didn't panic and i prioritized the right things which is completing the development then i took the pawn and and the main thing that won me the game was recognizing when you need to make these unglamorous moves okay these unglamorous moves are what are the glue moves that win you the game right and and if you can know when to make them uh you stop your opponent's threats and uh you you know you you end up in much better shape let me see doesn't bishop g someone stated uh how to recognize well if it was that simple uh everybody would be a gm but i'm trying my best to uh you know to flesh out the thought process why didn't you take the rook when it was trapped well uh because basically i again there's no rush if we take the rook then he plays bishop takes b4 and at least he curbs his losses here not only is he going to lose his rope but if he moves it he loses more stuff than that so this is just uh i'm just going for more here than just the exchange but here we go no time wasted another game let's hope thank you jay grindel for the five gifted okay so he plays the karo khan defense which is we've encountered it a couple of times black prepares to go d5 now we know that we want to control the center here and he goes d6 he doesn't go d5 okay so basically uh what am i going to do now i'm simply going to develop my pieces which is um which is what you basically do in the opening my opponent is just pushing his pawns out which is weird uh it's weird but i don't have to change my strategy because my opponent's doing something weird what should i do in this position how should we continue developing and what's sort of the best the simplest way of developing our pieces we're going to keep it simple here keep it old school who can tell me the simplest possible move we could play sorry we could play off four to control the center but what i'm going to do is simply go knight f3 no knights before bishops is the key role now i'm going to develop my bishop now i'm going to castle in the meantime he's just trolling me he's pushing all his pawns out he thinks he's being intimidating or funny neither of which are true okay maybe he's being funny now here's the thing he finally developed a piece thank you mr x when your opponent plays this passively you guys already know kind of the general thing that we have to do which is to open up the center because by opening up the center we're going to allow my pieces uh to just to actually infiltrate otherwise he's going to get away with this so we need a plan now the obvious way of opening the center is to go e5 but then he's gonna go d5 and keep things shut so what should i do how should i smash the center open and keep it open should i go e5 no i shouldn't what should i do let's get that hammer in and let's go d5 and i'm going to play a little bit faster we had another plan that would have been even better and i'll explain it after the game but here this is simple now he's trying to close the center look at this pawn on e5 very carefully what i want to do here is i want to push my pawn out to f4 in order to contest that pawn in order to open up that e file which is the main artery to his king but i can't do that right because there's a knight in the way where should we put the knight let's go knight d2 i didn't choose this square at random this knight could then travel to c4 and attack the b6 pawn okay he stops me from going f4 now knight c4 immediately would be fine but then he would push his pawn out to b5 and attack my knight um what should i do to preemptively stop him from pushing this pawn kind of like a surgeon you know you're you're handcuffing that pawn we should go a4 we use our pawn to prevent hispan from moving on the next move we're going to sandwich this knight on c4 and we've got a very nice position here we haven't really fully opened up the center but his position is really full of holes one of those holes is f5 we're going to stick a bishop there just keep on increasing the pressure and guess what well we've got this e-file right we want to open up the file but we can't do that yet we got to prepare it let's prepare it by going rookie one and we're actually kind of ready to play f4 but okay so he shuts down that e file um let's continue sort of chiseling our way uh into his position how do we do that we can deploy our queen but i want to go a5 to create this little outpost for my knight on b6 oh that's not a good move by him what should we take with the knight or the rook what do you guys think and again those of you who are sort of like not fully falling i will explain everything after the game in far more depth you can see this is a five minute game so i have to play fast some things i cannot explain at one of the time too we take with the knight why because we attack the bishop we want to play actively we want to recapture in a way that creates a threat also this knight has access to an outpost now we're going to lift our rook up potentially aiming for c4 where it's going to chase the queen away remember rooks can be activated too but we can't go rook c4 immediately right why not because we dropped the knight so can one of you brave souls tell me how can we first defend the knight so that we can then deploy our rook to c4 yes sir nose knows all does know the move it's queen a1 what am i doing well that queen's going to guard the knight oh and he's going to regret this he is going to regret this because we're going to take it now we're going to complete our plan now we've given up a pawn but i've sacrificed it i haven't blundered it and the reason i sacrificed it is to open up that center remember that that was our initial plan and our opponent has basically done that for us that's what a sacrifice is in chess it's when you give something up for some reason right you give up upon in order to do something that's good for you okay now we're going to well what should we do we've got a million moves here let me think for a second i also have to i think let's go knight c6 let's stick our knight on this outpost queen to b7 now let's just keep increasing the pressure how should we do that can somebody propose a move how should we keep increasing the pressure let's go queen to a4 absolutely creating a pin now we can take with the rook very good guys all of you are sharp i appreciate it the engagement okay so now let's lift the other rook up to b3 let's go and where is mr queen going here now the thing is if the queen moves out to c7 ladies and gentlemen thank you 107 bits it it walks right into the x-ray of the other rook this is what happens when you have well-placed pieces um mrs queen i just sorry that was bad mrs queen of course um but basically yeah he's on the ropes now if if knight b6 follows here um then well then we have several things that we can do now notice that the queen is undefended here so if i move the queen let's say to here then he will not be able to take the rook uh because uh because the queen will be undefended but actually this is not so simple he does have a move uh d5 which i didn't fully anticipate uh but okay so he's this guy is playing very well so let me take let me think for a second here we're still in good shape don't worry okay so he does this wow that is a very strong move yeah this is actually kind of sticky i have to say okay we can take the rook though and now we can slide this rook over to g3 now i've got a focus i've got 20 seconds this might be the strongest opponent we face today so i couldn't have taken the knight and i'll explain why after the game it was an insane tactical idea that he came up with okay now we're going to undermine this pawn and create some create some look for our king again i'll explain everything after the game but you guys can see i have 23 seconds so i gotta play fast the suspense is on the charlie fans came at a great time okay we're gonna take the pun he gives us a check we're gonna move the king now i do happen to like bullet chests so this is you know i'm experienced in these types of situations and i gotta make a move my man my goodness okay yeah this guy is vastly underrated vastly underrated but i think we'll be fine all right drum roll please ladies and gentlemen drum roll please nobody go anywhere i'm actually nervous i'm winning but i've got 13 seconds will i make it will i make it 11 seconds to win the end game will i do it all right where you got an endgame i'm up a piece but i gotta win this in nine seconds i gotta start pre-moving we're gonna make it happen ladies and gentlemen we're gonna make it happen i'm gonna win this that was close that was the closest i've come to losing a speedrun game this guy was incredible but wait i still gotta win and i got seven seconds to checkmate him but the thing is at some point the center is your muscle memory what i'm doing here is i'm doing something called a pre-move a pre-move is a move that you execute regardless of what your opponent does it only takes 1.1 seconds to make a pre-move so i'm able to to make a lot more moves now here i have a queen against the king this is one of the easiest checkmates in chess i'll be able to basically check my name while pre-moving all of my moves and what you can see that i'm doing here is i'm cutting off his king boom boom and ladies and gentlemen we have ourselves a checkmate what a game what a game and the perfect yeah there's so much to talk about here now the one thing i want to emphasize is that it's not about playing games fast i want to make sure i explain everything so that people actually learn you guys shouldn't be that impressed i shouldn't have let this get down this close um and you know i i definitely let this slip a little bit in some moment but he played very well so i i did my best okay so let's go through this game let me unpack everything for you guys so basically in the opening okay when you start a chess game basically you want to control the center the center broadly speaking is these four squares that i just highlighted in red when you control the center your pieces get more space and you're able to put your pieces on better squares where they can be better positioned to start an attack against your opponent's king as you guys know the ultimate objective of the game of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king to put him in a situation where the king is in check and has no squares so our opponent was just was just pushing out his pawns without controlling the center which is why i got a very nice position at the start i'm just developing and here the move d5 was played now instead of this what should i have done what i should have done is try to open up this file for my rook sticky bro thank you for the prime how should i have gone about doing that can somebody tell me a plan that i can execute to open up that f file and don't worry i'll be i'll be pretty quick here we'll get started on the next game soon but you know if you guys are in in here to improve you want to get better you know try to engage pay attention ask any questions you want um no such thing as a bad question it's okay to make mistakes i'm we're here to learn so i say that every time and i mean it uh d the sony thing with the prime so knight d2 would have been correct i did this in the game then we pushed the f pawn to f5 and we take on e6 now why would we want to open up the f file let's say that he makes a bunch of random moves the reason we open up the f-file is because it's a direct artery to his king in fact white has checkmate in two moves well technically in three moves here check on h5 and then checkmate on f7 you see how quickly checkmate follows after the king is opened up like this um so that's that's a very very typical situation okay so instead i played d5 and now i went knight d2 so i did the same thing in this position to try to open up that f i appreciate it brett stick and and loving the fact that so many people have stuck around we've got seven almost 8 000 viewers so uh thank you guys so much i really really appreciate it um okay so i got my knight to a good square the move a4 why did i play it i played it to stop b5 if i'd gone knight c4 immediately he could have kicked my knight away with the move b5 okay a4 knight c4 now let me fast forward to the moment where i basically almost ran out of time so takes rook a4 here i'm just activating all of my pieces sacrificing a pawn in order to open up the center and to get rid of his bishop and essentially now i thought i was completely winning but he managed to survive so boom boom we got our rook to a great square and now the fun starts okay so let's do this blow by blow this is called a fork okay not a literal fork a fork is when a piece attacks two other pieces you guys see that the knight the black knight attacks the queen and the rook but this is called a pin it's like a flush and a straight and poke or a pin is when there is one piece in another piece and they're in the same line or diagonal now one of the pieces that's the piece that's behind the pinned piece the pinned piece is the knight has to be of greater value so a pin is good because the knight can't really move if the knight moves he loses his queen right that's why this pin is so strong so it's a fork versus a pin i moved my queen which means that if he takes on c4 he drops his queen and a queen is more valuable than a rook and i moved my queen to b4 to attack his knight but now he pushed his pawn out to d5 all of a sudden this bishop opens up attacking my queen and he's attacking my rook so things get super messy here this is a discover check a lot of terminology here but i'll introduce it bit by bit the op shot is that this position occurred on the board this is an amazing position because here's the thing i could have taken his knight on b6 okay that's a free knight or so it seems now first of all if he takes my rook what does white do i just take his queen right if he takes the queen then my rook which was being attacked takes his queen and i'm up a piece but what did my devilish opponent cook up here what does black actually have and i saw this at the last second i could have lost this game this was an amazing idea watch this who can spot it who can spot it so rook to you you guys are is in the right direction that's exactly the right idea there's a problem though that is defended you guys have a good eye for tactics you're seeing the back rank mate but here's the thing queen to d5 does exactly the same thing now the queen threatens to checkmate the king no problem right it's okay but wait a second the rook is also hanging so in effect this is a fork your forking checkmate threat and the rook white cannot defend both at the same time it would be nice if the rook could travel to e1 but it can't no matter where you move the rook you can only block the check but you can't stave off the mate there's nothing i can do if i go rook d3 trying to intercept the queen then c takes d3 and black will be up a rook for a bishop which is a pretty disastrous situation that's called being up in exchange and so that is why i played rook to g3 and didn't take his knight that's hard to see and kudos to my opponent for finding this now i play h3 this is the pin pawn cannot move because he loses his king that's illegal and so i won a pawn and i got a winning position but at this point i had almost no time and my opponent continued to defend very well now there is one very cool idea i wanted to show you guys this is a fork i attack his rook and i attack his knight what if he had gone rook to b5 defending his knight with his rope white actually has a beautiful checkmating idea there are several ways to deliver checkmate but there is one move that's just very pretty who can spot it queen to d8 is the fastest mate but who sees the pretty mate knows nozzle is on a roll this man and yep rook hey sacrificing the rook dropping the king to h8 and queen fate is checkmate this is a typical pattern queen delivers the check bishop holds the king back right no squares queen d8 also was checkmate this is like the business approach queen to h8 is made is also possible or you could go rook h7 so lots of mates here he correctly gave up a piece i traded queens which is normally what you do when you're up material you want to trade pieces simplify the game and of course here i had like six seconds so i had to try my best but what i did was that i managed to trade rooks which made the win a lot simpler for me now i tossed his king out of the way and won the pawn and won the game that's basically what happened any questions and that was a complicated game there were some details that i didn't that i kind of left out uh but but i try to sort of give you the thrust of the game and extract the crucial lessons great opponent my opponent played very well and honestly if he didn't play such a bad opening uh who knows what would have happened he gave me a pretty big head start by pushing his pawns out like this um i think he played like a 23 2400 or so uh so big big kudos to my opponent let's go
