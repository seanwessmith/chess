[Music] here we go 1931 and again we are playing with the white pieces and again i'm gonna play one e4 okay yeah i'll go over that herb master i'll be sure to go over that after the game so he plays d5 this is called the scandinavian opening and i have a very fun fact about the scandinavian i'll share uh after the game now the reason that i don't recommend this candy to most players is because you bring the queen out early very early before the other pieces if you've seen searching for bobby fischer you you'll know that that's another great chess movie in the movie the main character he has a problem with bringing the queen out early the problem with bringing the queen out early is that i'm able to develop my pieces and attack the queen at the same time which gives me a lead in development in addition i'm going to control the center now by playing d4 continue my development normally you want to develop your knights before your bishops and this is what and maybe somebody with a little bit less experience remind me what this is called and how do we defend against this what can we do about this this is called a pin i can't move my knight i would drop my queen and the way that we can defend against the pin there's two main ways we can try to get this bishop out of the picture or we can intercept the pin with one of our lesser value pieces in which case we can now move our knight and that would simply lead to a bishop trade that's fine we don't need to move our knight we just can if we wanted to so now we're going to continue developing now we're going to continue developing and now let's centralize our knight and when i say centralized i mean literally put a piece on one of the central squares where the piece is the most active now we haven't completed our development there is a bishop the bishop has not been developed where should we put this bishop let's give him a taste of his own medicine let's give him a taste of his own medicine yeah we got a huge raid from charlie f5 uh so i think you guys mean g5 yep bishop to g5 what is this this is a pin but look at his position he's passive here he's really cramped on these last couple rows look at my pieces they had a bishop knight they're all well placed and guess what when all of your pieces are well placed like this you immediately need this and charlie would be the first to say this you got to think about attacking now in order to attack we need to open up some files and avenues toward his king uh and one idea that comes to mind look at this rook very carefully do you remember guys in the last game i had a plan let me very quickly show you oh it doesn't let me look at the last game so i had a plan where i basically opened up that f file sorry one sec oh there it is i basically needed to open up that f file by playing knight d2 f4 and f5 can you see the parallel here what can white do here it's the same exact plan we can go f4 f5 open up the file for the rook and this rook is also going to put a lot of pressure on the knight so that's where pattern recognition happens that's why i always emphasize to people if you want the fastest way of improving look at your own games figure out your mistakes figure out what you should have done and you can use the computer for that and and try to build off of that try to kind of collect in your mind or even in a real notebook uh the various ideas and the plans that you think are cool that you could apply in a future game that's what makes chess so magical there's always an x game and there's always an opportunity to correct your mistakes so let's see what he does now c5 would be no problem we would just take on c5 and arcane can be tucked away into the corner here where it's very safe and uh he's in some trouble he's in some trouble because we're about to play f5 we can also bring this rook into d1 in order to support the pawn on d4 why would we do this because he might move his bishop back and if he moves his bishop back then his queen is going to attack our pawn uh it would be a good idea to defend it okay it's not that i don't care about the clock um but i think the explanation is more important now can we play them with f5 is that a good idea or do we want to prepare it what do you guys think there's actually something better that we can do well there's there's quite a coup there's quite a few good things we could do i think that we should go f5 let's see what happens in a tournament game i actually myself would not play f5 and i'll explain why after the game but he takes now what well we can recapture we could also capture his knight but there's no need to do that let's accumulate the pressure rook takes five now the file has been opened okay now things get really interesting okay so let's unpack this situation we have a knight here how many times has the knight defended one two three the knight is also being attacked three times we don't need to worry about it because uh the knight is defended the same number of times that it's being attacked so one thing that we would consider doing here is bringing all of the pieces into the game we can do that in several different ways so one of them is to go rook 8 to f1 this is called doubling the rooks where the two rooks are stacked on the same file and this increases the pressure on the f-file now he's got a very very strong move here he doesn't find it he plays takes and now this is a fork it is true we are also pinned it's the same thing we saw in the last game we're forked but we fork him but we're also pinned but still look at his knight that night is under so much pressure look at all of our pieces staring it down as soon as this knight is captured that king is going to be in huge show because he's going to recapture with a pawn he's going to have to okay and he finds a cool idea but it doesn't well does it work though these people are good ladies and gentlemen so he seems to blunder a bishop let's see what his idea is and he gives me a fork he forks my king in the rook are we screwed are we screwed we are not we can drop the ruck back we can drop the rook back simultaneously defend against the check and the fork and now we're simply up a piece he plays knight d5 we capture it and uh now all we need to do and we have a very cool idea i'm going to un-pin myself i'm going to unpin myself he takes my reign he resigns now there was something very cool here if he would have taken my rook and i'll explain everything what would i have done in this position i would not have recaptured his rook which would be fine there is actually a very cool checkmate thank you thank you kwams and and we had a sub that i missed i apologize for that thank you um rod yakassa for the sub queen takes f7 is backrank made exactly take stakes and good by kingovich exactly okay so let's walk through that and as you can see the opponents are getting better these games are are becoming more competitive which is what's making this fun now he played the scandi okay knight f3 bishop b2 again unpinning ourselves so that the knight can now move we did move the knight did i blunder the pawn here why didn't i why didn't my opponent take on d4 what was my idea who can tell me yeah and i'll show you guys everything in a moment well what this move accomplishes is that it opens up the opens up the d file as we've already seen you want to be careful about giving rooks open files because open files can lead to checkmate very very quickly thank you five nor latch for the tier one his queen has to move back just visually look at how active my pieces are his pieces are basically on their initial squares black is in very big trouble um well i have a story about the scandi i've told this story before funny story and then we'll move on for the game uh to the game uh the year is about 1895 and two strong british players are facing each other so in the 1800s there used to be a very old rule in tournament chess that if you touched a piece that had no legal squares you had to move your king okay that was just a rule uh in order to discourage people from you know just touching all the pieces right nowadays it's you don't you're not punished for that but it is touch move if you touch a piece an official tournament chess you have to move it so this guy touches the bishop on c1 and maybe he you know looked at the position wrong or hallucinated now the bishop has no legal squares right it's blocked in by its pawns so he had to move his king and he chose the most disastrous time to do it what does black have in this position this is one of the shortest games in chess history because amazingly black has the move queen e4 checkmate this is not a mate that everybody's familiar with it's a three-move checkmate not the fastest that's possible but look at white's king and the queen they're in a standoff king has no squares the queen controls all of them a little rhomboid shape here anyways i think that guy did not have a very good day after that but let's go back to the game so essentially he didn't take our pawn we pinned his knight why didn't we play the move knight e4 applying pressure on his knight on f6 the reason is very much the same remember again connect the patterns bishop b2 unpinning us from this pin and symmetrically he can do exactly the same thing you can play bishop e7 his queen is no longer pinned and the knight on f6 is now very very well defended so i can trade a bunch of pieces here but that's not good for me training pieces lessens the intensity of the attack when you're attacking you need pieces to deliver checkmate with and that's why i played f4 okay so f4 f5 takes takes rook to f1 and then he finds this very cool idea bishop takes c5 and queen d4 so this is a fork because he's attacking the king and the rook if i move the king he takes the rook i can't take back because his queen is defending the rook a rookie three is the defensive move now he had a better try here than what he did he could have what was this better try what was this better try oh why wouldn't i play f5 in tournament chess so the reason i wouldn't play f5 is because i was a little bit scared of his response queen to b6 attacking the pawn on d4 if i was playing a grandmaster i would have played a slower move such as rook to d1 so knight to g4 you guys are absolutely correct um knight g4 was a better try it's the same exact thing as after knight d5 except i don't control that square so he wants to take my rook can somebody spot white's response i had seen this and i calculated one step ahead queen e3 he still takes the rook with the queen it's not knight d1 although you're very close it's not queen f3 either if we try queen f3 i understand what you guys want to do but remember in comparison to that thing we talked about he's got two rooks on e8 so queen f8 is not back right mate smash factors amazing some of you are getting it the move is rook to d1 how do i come up with this move what does it do two things that it does we attack the queen right we attack the queen so if he takes our rook with either piece then we take his queen and if you calculate the variation then at the end of the day white is up a whole piece i am up a bishop that's huge that's winning if he takes with the knight now i'm up a queen now you might be looking at this and saying okay but no problem i mean can't he just move his queen back to b6 and once again we're faced with the same idea of him taking on e3 but this is what you have to do you always have to try to detect how the position changes as a consequence of the last couple moves if you look very carefully at this position you can't play rookie 8 because of the pin that's what a pin is that is illegal because the king will be under fire right this is what a pin is you you cannot expose your king by it by law so if you look at how the position has changed it changed change it you can now take the knife the knight is no longer defended he takes the rook we take the rook he takes the bishop we move the king away the smoke is cleared and white is now up a night okay what about rook to f4 great question rook to f4 has the same idea but it's the wrong execution jimmy garoppolo would find this move instantly because there's an interception that happens we ins we accidentally intercept uh i'm a big 49ers fan yes and i'm kind of sour about how things are going the rook on e3 is no longer protected and uh i am from the bay area by the way anyways uh so that's basically the idea now queen f2 to unpin ourselves and attack f7 which caused them to resign which caused them to resign okay doosan five five five and we're playing with the black pieces let's play the situation lucas aiden the sicilian is when you play c5 and the opening that i have been playing almost exclusively well never mind because he does not play the main line which is d4 he plays c3 this is called the aleppo and sicilian uh named after a lithuanian chess player his idea is to prepare to control the center with the move d4 okay now what we need to do here as black is we need to immediately contest the center with our pieces so we're going to get the night out in order to attack his pawn so that he doesn't have a chance to play before he goes bishop to d3 take bologna thank you that's not a great move because now we can occupy the center and his bishop has blocked the other bishop from coming out which is something you want to really a situation you want to try to avoid he's got e5 attacking our knight can somebody tell me where should we put this knight where should we go in order to attack this pawn white is not worse here this is a line but yeah knight g4 let's get to this pawn let's try to win it now his correct move yep he plays it correctly very nice it goes bishop b5 uh to attack my knight the usual let's un-pin that knight so the knight can once again move there's a lot of trap this is a line i used to study ah but ladies and gentlemen we have a very sexy move here look at this bishop we've encountered this tactic many times before and those of you just joining i'll show you guys after the game the precedent we can play knight takes e5 i think if i'm calculating this right i might be dropping a piece here now what what am i doing well what i'm doing is that this bishop look at it very carefully it's hanging which means if he takes the knight we take his bishop but if he takes the bishop with check thinking ah then i'm gonna take the night nope because this very same night is it's double parked it's gonna take the take take the bishop and at the end of the day we're gonna be up a pawn we're up a pawn but we still need to complete our development and we're not just up any pun we're up a center pawn it worked it worked like a charm now he's doing exactly what i did in the previous game which is he's trying to open up the file it's a pretty nasty idea can we stop him from going f5 not physically but can we take the sting out of that move can we try to prevent it how who can tell me and this is a very instructive moment so we go g6 and after the game i will explain why we don't literally stop him why not f5 there's a reason for that be patient i'll explain that after the game i've put i've noted it down now why does g6 stop f5 because it adds another defender remember pawns capture diagonally it adds another defender to f5 so if he goes f i will just take it what is the other thing that this move accomplishes and uh first what we're going to do here is let's lock up the position a little bit so that we can focus on completing our development the other thing that it does is that it it creates a little hole for the bishop this is called fianchettoing the bishop it's an italian term which means to put the bishop on the longest diagonal on the chessboard either this one or this one generally fianchettos happen on g2 b2 b7 or g7 and now we are going to complete our development by castling now we need to come up with a plan we need to come up with a plan and um we need to come up with a well first of all let's take a look at this night we can trade possible but this night let me tell you has perhaps the sexiest outpost of all time where can this knight travel to who can spot a very nice square on the board in the center of the board where this knight could land let's go absolutely this is called an outpost an outpost is a square in your opponent's territory where a piece cannot be bothered by any pawns if you look at the pawns they've advanced past this square so they can never never chase away the knight this is called an eternal knight in russian now is this knight on e5 is that knight eternal is that night eternal is this on an outpost can we show him that this night is no get out of here it ain't eternal nope out and guess what once he moves his knight out if he goes back to e5 we're gonna take it with our bishop now why would we give up our bishop because look at our bishop very carefully the bishop isn't really doing anything anyway it's just biting on granite as i like to say every single stream 50 times so we might as well give it up for his knight and rid ourselves entirely of that of that uh nuisance now look at this knight versus this bishop this is a classic case of good knight vs bad bishop our knight is on an outpost his bishop is incredibly cramped but we need a plan we can't win this game without a plan what could our plan look like how could we transform this positional advantage into something specific what can we so there's two main plants here we could play on the queen side or we could bring pieces into the king side and try to attack his king because i don't have much time let's do the second thing and also because i'm going to but we can also combine let's combine the plans let's now go b5 to just lend some reinforcements to b5 remember you can combine plans and chess you can do two things at the same time particularly if you have very active pieces uh you can multitask that's okay play on both sides so we're gonna try to prepare the b4 pawn breakthrough but at the same time we're gonna keep an eye on possibilities for attacking his king okay and i'm gonna play a little bit faster here now if he he knows what he's doing he's going to play a3 to prevent me from from potentially preparing b4 and then i'm gonna have to redirect my attention to to this side of the board okay so let's first test him a little bit let's prepare b4 hopefully well no he doesn't go a3 so we might as well strike with b4 okay why am i doing this what am i accomplishing what i'm accomplishing ultimately is i'm trying to open up the b file why is it important to open up the file because if we open up the file this rook on b2 you see that you see that it can infiltrate to b2 the second rank is prime real estate this is you know central park new york real estate for the rook and he's doing our bidding for us he's allowing me to open up the file for the other rook so he there's gonna be hell today we're gonna trade queens here and you guys might wait a second why are we trading queens well because we've got more than enough pieces to checkmate him with even without the queen's watch okay what do we do now somebody remind me i've got a thing for the sub true three false three thank you for the two months let's go let's go let's go let's go rook b2 infiltration now we're going to put the other rook on f1 it's going to be not checkmate immediately we shouldn't rush but he's either going to get trackmated or he's going to lose a bunch of his pieces so we're going to give him a check forcing his rope to drop out we can't take the classic sort of russian very old-school big zarook look at the domination of the knight over the bishop neither of these pieces have moved a muscle since move 17. so that's been the narrative of the game that's been like the unspoken sort of backdrop in which everything is proceeded without a bishop and this bishop is essentially a big pun he just can't play he he doesn't have the sufficient horse horsepower literally and figuratively to sort of prevent me from just ravaging his position i'm going to push the pawn out to a3 this pawn isn't going anywhere he gives me a meaningless check this king could evacuate to h6 nice little square and here we need another plan i'm going to play this slowly i'm going to advance my pawns on the king side no need to rush here because white is completely paralyzed 150 paralyzed and this is a mistake i see a lot of players making is just a rush you never you don't need to rush in a position like this you can make all the necessary improvements push that pass pawn down the board and then we're going to combine that with the other pass pawn g3 knight defends the pawn so he cannot take it with his bishop okay this is a nice positional game actually total domination the king is perfectly safe because there's no if he gives me a check i can go to h6 he probably is going to give me a check that would be my prediction although okay rook a6 close so g2 check okay so now what do we do who can tell me the move and now it's time to finally do something specific and and win some pieces oh nitro5 is a sexy move oh i love that i didn't even see that now my idea was to go rook to a1 and win as bishop that would have been possible that would have been sort of the brute force method but this man uh is a savage this knight is going to f3 what's the idea well let's actually just ignore him the idea is to get the knights f3 dislodge the king and then promote our pawn and make a queen we're not even bothering to win any of his pieces okay king takes age six yeah and uh he's going to give up the rook for the night but that doesn't help his cause because the game is over okay look at this domination rook's gonna move out and we're gonna finally we can actually even take the bishop we need to be careful now in such positions remember do not pre-move because you might stalemate your opponent be very careful when you've got a bunch of extra pieces about stalemating your opponent that's why i don't recommend pre-moving too much unless you're absolutely sure that you haven't pre-moved something which could lead to stalemate and the game is over 48 moves and a nice game okay so let's unpack this he went c3 we went knight f6 now bishop d3 is already in inaccuracy and bishop d7 remember this idea it should be seared in your memory by now and i've shown you guys those of you who are joining for the first time what i like to do sometimes during the speed run is to show examples from real games that i played in over the board tournaments to show how i applied various ideas that i'm applying in the speed run and to show how how this kind of learning proceeds so the game that i always like to show when we have a tactic like this is the following game from 2010 which reached the following position i had the black pieces against an international master my rating back then was 2356 so i was a master but not yet a grandmaster this position that you guys now see july 11th i played uh icelandic international master he was rated exactly the same as i was rated and in this position very complicated position he plays the move uh bishop to g5 trying to exert pressure on my knife who can spot my response and some of you will remember this game i don't mean to keep repeating it but just want for the benefit of you know the new people to show this one more time knight takes d5 is correct same exact idea if um bishop takes c7 then well it is a lecture that's basically my idea knight takes c7 that same knight gives it a same knight that takes the pawn takes the bishop if he takes the knight then i take his bishop and the queen defense the bishop on g5 which i applied in this game it's literally the same thing on the other side of the board um thank you guys i'm i am very spoiled and thank you crazy zamarigali for the tier one knight takes c5 right same exact thing it's just a slightly different version of it bishop is protected knight protects the bishop literal trans position of the pattern g6 stopping f5 fianchettoing the bishop we lock up the position first we complete our development and we get the knight to e4 now the typical mistake that i see players make in the 18 1900 rating range and and below is this tendency to automatically trade when you're up material so you're taught when you're a beginner that when you're up material pawn piece you want to simplify you want to trade and normally that's true but i've insisted from the very start of the speed run that you should be very discriminating about how you go about trading there's no need to trade the knife because our knight is much better than his night and that's why we get the knight to e4 kick his knight away and now we get a brilliant good night against bad bishop situation and this is like a textbook position i've been on the receiving end of many such positions with a good knight basically dominating a bad bishop can you give us an example i hear you say i absolutely can if you guys just give me one more second and again i can't emphasize enough just how much it's important to to to approach your game seriously and to to try to learn from them because then you're able to directly apply them look at the following position almost exactly the same thing watch this this is actually kind of cool it's almost the same squares just a slightly different position well look at this this is not from the speedrun game i was black against the grandmaster 2009. look knight on d5 totally dominating completely dominating the bishop on d8 in the center of the board supported by the pieces the bishop has no prospects and eventually it was precisely the night that one white the game i eventually got my bishop out but i got checkmated this was from a uh a night off so coming back to the speed run we see a different position you know you don't want to over generalize but it's very very similar the bishop is just terrible the night is amazing and the night is on an outpost it's completely unassailable okay so essentially what we did now is we combined two plans we attacked on the queen side and we attacked on the king side but he basically helped us he opened up the file which allowed this rook now to infiltrate at the correct moment to f1 rook takes g1 and we played it old school we just traded the rope and took the pawn that was not the only way to win could somebody find another possibility in this position how else could i have transformed my position uh to to my favorite i'm gonna show you guys another example from a very famous game thank you friend 42 tier 1 now we could have played knight to f2 moistevi thank you so much i appreciate it exactly now this is a fork he has to take the knight and then we play rook f1 takes f2 this is called piggies on the seventh these rooks are going to massacre all of whites pawns checkmate is threatened white has to create some air for his king but basically black takes all of white's pieces and this is easily winning now here's the thing i promise last detour um there was a very famous game and the point that i want to make is this when you have a good piece against a bad piece such as a good night against the bad bishop right what you want to be very careful about is making categorical statements like i will never give up um well you you never do want to give up in general but i will never give up my good piece for my opponent's bad piece because in chess you have to understand the concept of transforming your advantage going from one type of advantage to another and what that sometimes requires is giving up a piece that looks really nice for one of your opponent's pieces that looks kind of bad and there was a very very famous example of this by none other than the man that's uh in the photo frame behind me bobby fisher who was playing a match for the world championship um against well not yet but a candidate's match against tigran petrossian and he did something very very similar here you guys go here we go bobby fisher white 1971 one of the most famous games actually of all time now this position occurred on the board between fisher petrossian now i want you guys to compare look at this beautiful piece outpost supported by a pawn in the middle of things thank you g dark side look at this pathetic little bishop yarny said not doing anything look at this pathetic bishop guess what bobby fischer does in this position guess what he does he does something that shocked the players who were watching the game they thought is he hallucinating what did he do he took it damn girl what are you doing bobby he takes the bishop what is he doing giving up this beautiful knight he transforms the advantage because guess what he gets the c file and look very carefully at this pawn on a6 this is the pawn that he's going after what he's trying to do by taking the bishop he is removing the primary defender of the spawn petrossian would have put his bishop on b5 or back to c8 and he would have kept this pawn protected so what fisher decides is i'm going to go after that pawn by trying to get my rook to c6 but trojan stops him but much like in our game fisher gets one rook to the seventh rank and i'm gonna fast forward fast forward and he gets the other rook to the seventh round so quite literally it's a very similar narrative here and he checkmates black petrosian resigned here because uh he cannot stop the rook maneuvering itself to h8 i don't want to go through the details of this but that's just to show you guys that this kind of stuff happens all the time okay um so that was that was that game so back to the speed on transformation transformation of the advantage now we decided to go old school taking the rook taking the pawn and just promoting our pawns now knight g5 was a really nice move uh preparing knight f3 we could have also gone to rook a1 that was my intention and taking the bishop and leaving us up a night okay um you were going to explain f5 instead of gc thank you for reminding me it is in my notebook i appreciate it why did i not just brute force stop f5 with the five could somebody explain this to me narrative i like it that is not the same tigran petrossian unfortunately he passed away in the 80s the world champion today's tigran petrossian is a grand master same name different person we weaken the e6 pawn now actually ladies and gentlemen it's not queen h5 check this is innocuous because black can go g6 to block the check okay so that's that is part of it but that's not strictly speaking the reason the reason is the pawn on e6 look at how weak it is and the definition of a weak pawn is upon it cannot be protected by any other pawns right that's the dictionary definition uh but not all weak pawns are bad it's just that this one is very easy to attack because it's also an artery to the king got to be very careful about that not a disaster we can defend it but why allow something like this why give white a target okay hopefully that makes sense so that's why i played g6 now this pawn is nicely protected rookie one is innocuous we can just keep developing so what's the lesson here be very careful about creating what's called a backward pawn a pawn that's behind its neighbors particularly one that's next to your king every time you push a pawn out like this especially the f pawn just try to very quickly check to see whether you create any weaknesses and whether these weaknesses are easy to attack okay what would you take with if he had pushed f5 well if he had pushed f5 i would have definitely taken the g pawn to keep that e file closed i should definitely would not have taken to the e pawn and allowed something like this to happen [Music] you
