platinumba 2042 i'm going to start playing different openings by the way now let's continue playing the king's indian though no rookie is not senseless you have the f8 square there it again with the close position you can move back to f8 okay so we have a kings indian castles and uh e5 this is the main line this is the main line of the king's indian and my opponent now we're playing serious people he plays the petrosian variation the trojan variation is where white immediately pushes d5 after the game i will talk a little bit about king's indian theory now one of black's main ideas in this position is to put the knight on c5 the move d5 has weakened the c5 square and from that square black can attack e4 but there is a problem if you put the knight on c5 prematurely white can chase it away with the move b4 so a very typical king's indian move is to play a5 preventing b4 and preparing to deploy the knight to c5 either via d7 or via a6 okay bro this is basically prophylaxis it also grabs space on the queen side and that's good as a standalone phenomenon now what is the main plan here for either side white prepares the queen side attack and black attacks on the king side what does it mean to attack on the king's side here there is one very typical idea that basically starts out all kings indian attacks on the queen side could somebody spell out this idea for me now let's be general though it's to move the knight and then to push the f pawn out to f5 but we don't just want to shove the knight anywhere we want to put the knight on a square where it also does something and one very typical maneuver is to go knight h5 with an eye toward going knight f4 we don't need to go knight f4 immediately but that's something we can keep an eye but wait a minute let's support the knight on c5 first before we go five how can we do that how can we make sure that you know this knight is very nicely supported before we play f5 another typical king's indian move we can play the move b6 very patient very patient move and now i'm going to show you something kind of cool so white is threatening before he's not actually threatening it and i'll show you guys that too after the game how can we prevent that we can play a4 but wait i hear you saying and he probably is going to and that's a mistake we give upon have we blundered it no we haven't we've sacrificed it why have we sacrificed it because of something called the dark squares now how can we exploit the dark squares in the fastest possible way not the b file the dark squares what can we now do what move is possible knight of four is typical but i want something nicer bishop h6 this by the way ladies and gentlemen is at another very typical kingdom we are setting up some beautiful ideas we are actually threatening checkmate which you just missed it is already checkmate and we can actually oh so there is a utilitarian mate but let me show you guys okay so so bishop e3 check and let me think so what's the simplest mo of course the simplest is to play queen h4 and knight g3 check do you guys want me to do it do you guys want me to show you something really cool we're gonna do this let's yeah and what is my idea i will i will show you everything what is no not queen h4 it's not going h4 what do you always need to check when you have a two move idea what happens if i play the second move first boom goes the dynamite and after he takes queen g5 and checkmate is unstoppable now i didn't invent any of this i've seen it before i will explain everything now i know that not everybody plays the king's indian and that's why the premise of the speed run is not to fixate on openings because i'm respectful of the fact that people play different openings so i'll try to keep things relatively brief opening wise but i highly recommend the king's indian anybody who's an attacking player okay so first of all to recap right e5 e5 does not blunder the pawn because if we take the pawn or let's say this is the exchange variation this is a viable line but to take the pawn here is not a good idea because it allows knight takes c4 exposing the attack on the knight takes and bishop takes e5 one very important detail why can try the desperado sacrifice knight takes f7 and if we take the knight white's gonna end up upon up what can black do here to refute this who can who can tell me how black refutes this without this the king's indian would not have existed a c5 is viable but that's the more benoni-like approach bishop c3 and king f7 nicely done guys so that's the tactical reason the king's indian works he goes d5 he defines the center immediately this is called the petrossian variation after tiger and petrossian the main line is to castle and here actually black has the additional option of taking on d4 rare line but i like it and we won't delve into this right now but he goes d5 so a5 right stopping b4 then we get the knight to c5 and now by playing f3 he has cut contact with the h5 square so in the king's indian generally there's three ways of preparing a 5 right you can step away to e8 and then go f5 and then go back to f6 you can go to d7 although this is more rare but this does have the benefit of supporting the knight it does however block the bishop sometimes you can even go king h8 knight ge kasparov patented this idea in numerous five gifts itself to the community keeps that 3am hype going 4 a.m hype going thank you and umarus for five gifted two midnight rhino le sergei walrus punk pabs and j curse loving it loving and loving it okay um so we go knight h5 he goes bishop e3 b6 and a4 has a foco thanks for the tier one now let's let me first explain why in like a grand master game i would not have gone a4 so if we go f5 and he goes before black is a very cool idea now how do you gauge the success before you gauge the success of before if the knight has to move somewhere like or black then white's gonna get c5 in and this is successful could anybody tell me how black can respond to the move before in a very good way and this actually is a typical king's indian idea it's not f4 at force you can just drop the bishop back i'll give you a hint takes takes and now what additional pretty maneuvered is black cowboo and that look at this beautiful juicy knight on d4 this actually helps black so this is a very important subtle idea for kingzinian experts to know but i played a4 to illustrate a concept now first of all why did we stop before because we cannot piss on him but he immediately sees the pawn and takes it right if he goes f4 then we will take it and now look at this beautiful bishop and look at this outpost on e5 this is generally what happens does that make sense so he takes the pawn immediately and we play bishop h6 deploying the bishop and look at these dark squares all around white's king that's the importance of squares you know when you weaken a whole complex of squares like this you're gonna be in big trouble but should be three is basically an unstoppable threat if he tries to stop it with queen b3 what simple tactical motif does black have and this basically transposes into the game yeah rook takes bishop e3 and if he covers it we can go queen h4 g3 oops sorry not queen g3 but knight g3 uh and this is absolutely crushing okay many top players of kings indian experts including ikaro he's played some brilliant games queen v3 so that's what would have happened there he goes b4 unaware of what's about to befall him now bishop e3 why is rook takes a4 necessary we use the technique of thinking backwards to find rook takes a4 we begin by asking why can i not do this followed by queen she five threatening queen h6 who can tell me what defensive resource white has it doesn't save the game white will still be lost but who can smell and sniff out how white prolongs the game f4 is correct and bishop h5 and of course taking with the queen here wouldn't be impossible you could take on a4 now and win but white's not going to take the rook that's going to be obvious but thinking backwards we say wait a second if white's queen could be made to disappear from d1 then this would be checkmate because h5 would not be defended by the queen right um so oh and by the way i see why i was unable to find games uh in in chess base so as you guys are thinking i am going to make another search here to show you guys if i can find any um ideas here okay i found a couple yeah so we we therefore take on a4 first forcing the queen out and now we give a check of course queen h4 would have been winning in fact it would not be trackmate immediately he could try to go h3 but this would be a very straightforward mate in a couple moves right definitely don't trade the dark square bishop now that doesn't mean you never do this but you can see the danger of weakening a complex of squares white should have gone knight d3 here but still knight b39d4 and black is better so against the averbach i'm getting a question about a very specific line of the king's indian uh again i'm gonna try not to stray too deeply into theoretical waters but the upper back is where white develops the two bishops first what i do here is queen to e8 getting out of the pin preemptively so that i can play e5 and then if d5 you can go knight a6 knight c5 kinda like we did in the game so let me now see if i can pull up a game where you will be able to see a very similar concept uh oh i see already several possibilities now oh here's a beautiful one here is a beautiful one guys from a pretty high level game 2300 so what i'm showing you serious players are uh you know they so this is a king's indian game in which literally all of the ideas we just applied were applied by this by by a pretty good player so this is a game between two russian players uh pretty competent you guys can see 2192 was black 2332 was white watch now petrossian variation literally the same position we had white played bishop g5 first here's b6 right i'm not making this stuff up these are legitimate ideas and black actually provoked f3 here's not h5 and hero black did something very interesting play bishop f6 preparing to to get the bishop to g5 weakening white stark squids white captured the pawn and black still played bishop g5 and hear white made the decisive mistake bishop takes f8 who can tell me what black did in this position boom boom and now boom but here use careful guys you have to apply the concepts in a smart way because the move queen g queen h4 there is knight f1 by the way queen h4 immediately here there's knight f1 and now all of a sudden white defends so it's not queen g5 there's a better way of doing this and you always have to look for the executions that are suited to the position when you're applying a pattern guys very very important don't autopilot the execution of an idea all right queen g5 knight f1 is a little bit less clear queen takes f8 knight f1 queen h69c and now black found the showstopper what's the final move of the combination this is a slightly more difficult position to execute this in verizon king g7 and once again you can go rook h8 but the beautiful mate is takes in rocket shape winning the game white's only way to stop this would be g4 but then just rook hg and white resigned in this position oh here's how a 2300 fell prey to precisely the sequence of moves so you see this stuff is real this stuff is applied and it's applied in games between pretty good players whoops speed one all right let's do one more what what about king f1 oh yeah yeah sorry uh king ah there was king f1 there was i think queen h4 that was a terrible game oh yeah okay let's do one more yeah white certainly didn't play well by the way make no mistake why white did not have a good day he shouldn't have taken the rook that was a mistake a 2300 uh shouldn't make but they do i mean they make them they make them too everybody's human yeah um i'm on a roll today careful let's go yeah i know i know sir oh we're playing the same guy we played last time who almost beat me okay so let's play an accelerated we're playing chess lebanese sal i was at 2100 and almost beat me the last time okay so we're going to take and play the accelerated and he's going to play the muratsi buying the best line that white has now here let me actually think about this for a second what we're going to do we're going to play the move we're going to play the move d6 i'm going to show you guys a pretty cool system against the accelerated now normally black develops to g7 with the bishop but i like a more rare system that i think is dangerous but he actually finds the right way to skirt it bishop b3 wow this guy is the real deal oh i should have got knight f6 actually okay whatever we'll just transpose them to the main line i i i messed up the move order we have to transpose into the main line um we have to transpose into the main line okay knight f6 and i'm going to show you guys some of the key ideas of the accelerated dragon i'm assuming that he doesn't know this that well now the marotzi bind in my opinion if white wants to get an advantage against the accelerated he should play the marotzi by that's really the only very very testing system against the accelerated and uh let's see how well he knows the ideas now how do we understand because this guy is underrated and really really good i ask for you guys understanding i'm going to play a little bit faster and i'm going to play maybe with a little bit less explaining than usual and then after the game i'll be sure to compensate now right now we're just going to develop our bishop to d7 so far we've just been developing our pieces there's nothing to explain basically black's idea is to play on the queen side and in order to play on the queen side black will have to black will have to operate according to the following formula first and foremost you need to you need to grab space on the queen side okay but in order to grab space we need to refocus our pieces a little bit let's take on d4 and where do you guys think we'll put this bishop on d7 where will we put this bishop on d7 we should put it on c6 all right that's just a good solid square and when i say grab space on the queen side what do i mean by that what i mean by that is we'll need to play a5 a4 and that will allow us to put that clamp down on the queen side so that we can then deploy our queen to a5 and start attacking him this is white is slightly better here according to the computer objectively white is better no doubt about it white's got more space he's got the central control but but in my experience this is hard to play uh accurately for a human being knight t5 is good knight t5 is a good move now let me thank you for a moment because i myself don't play the accelerated full-time so this is this is new to me as well okay so we're going to take that night with a bishop and after the game i will explain uh why i did that like fully but but there is a reason behind it let me just write this down now what pieces do we want to trade his puns his pawns are on the light squares what do we want to trade if and i'll be more specific which of the two bishops do we want white to give up we want to give up the dark script bishop because the light squared bishop is kind of lame right a lot of the pawns are on the same color as his bishop i don't put a lot of stock in that principle but here it's a good idea to apply now i i see you guys thinking well wait a second aren't isn't it weakening to give up our fiance bishop isn't that bad look it's not great that's a concession right but there's not that many pieces left in the first place so uh in my estimation it's not like he'll be able to attack my king furthermore okay goes f4 that's an interesting move and a very i think a very good one he expands preemptively on the king side so he will try to attack us on the king's side should we give up this bishop well i have no choice i kind of have to give up this bishop uh otherwise my whole strategy with 97 my whole campaign is just not that good and we have a decision to make do we trade queens queen b6 unfortunately conceptually this is good uh concretely this is bad because if queen takes b6 knight takes b6 and the rook penetrates to cesar so let's look at this knight for a second it's stuck in no man's land where can we put it king's indian style with nazi fob girl and what move does this open the possibility of in terms of expanding on the queen side in terms of expanding on the queen side what is now possible we can play yeah we can play a4 but um we can play a4 but that's that's missing well actually yeah we will play a4 we why why first of all we're grabbing space second of all what he wanted to do very sneaky guy that he is is play a4 himself and cement that bishop that splinter in our throat at least the bishop is now stuck and it's not as well defended how should we attack that bishop how should we attack that bishop we can play queen a5 but i like queen b6 which creates a standoff between the queens and i feel like i like the standoff because i'm in control of it the piece that's between two pieces if it's protected by a pawn that's a pretty specific principle but i think it might be a good one if you have a standoff between two pieces and the piece in in the middle of it is your piece and it's protected by a pawn you're usually in control of that standoff which means i'm usually the one here who's going to decide whether and if to trade queens which is a pretty powerful thing to do uh well before i can understand him okay so let's improve our position how can we do that could somebody name a simple improving move bringing a piece into the game yeah rook sierra okay here we have see this further supports the knight which i like and i would have also considered playing a3 okay so he goes king a very good move very good move and now i want to continue expand i'm gonna go queen b4 this is a very sneaky move um because i want him to play a3 i want him to play a3 and why do i want it to play a3 because it weakens something what does the move a3 weaken could somebody answer me this question while he's thinking the b3 square and i could potentially fork him on that square so he goes e6 okay let me calculate for a second i'm just uh calculating a little bit here there's some really cool cool lines oh so what can we do here what we can do is we can play the immediate move b5 and this is not that simple as it seems it seems like we're winning the bishop because the bishop came over because of them but what can he do dude dude what can you do dude what can he do and i'm gonna i'm gonna pre-move rook takes f7 check what can we do if we move the queen then what the hell did we do this for so what's the tactic who sees it i think we have a beautiful idea knight b3 now there's two things we're exploiting here if he takes the knight i take his queen and if he takes my queen i take his and look at the superiority that we now have uh our knight is guarding b5 we've got pressure on all at all angles here we play rook takes f7 once his bishop moves we're gonna take his rook take the pawn on f4 and we're gonna have a winning end game so um which which we'll have to win by playing precisely once again i have to give big props to my opponent he's really really good but it seems like he's going down here we're going to take the pawn and now we need to reassess the situation how are we actually going to specifically win this position well we're going to go after his queen side pawns and with that in mind where should we put the rook where should we put the rook and this should come automatically to you guys but now there's actually several ways to do it yeah rook f2 is correct attacking the font forcing his rook to get passive and now we're just going to grind them down here we're going to grind them down now one very important principle i've shared with you guys many times in the past never stop looking for tactics no matter how many pieces are left on the word one two and that's exactly what you guys are doing checkmate on h2 i think we actually played a super nice game i'm curious to see what our what is i don't usually do this but i'm actually curious i feel like i'm into this game and we're 2 000. yeah 88.3 not that good you never know what your accuracy is sometimes you feel good great you don't play well vice versa okay let's analyze i i don't think it likes the accelerated now the line that i was going to actually play starts with knight f6 i was going to recommend this line where you get the queen to d4 so that when you fianchetto you create the extra but i'm not gonna talk about that right now we transitioned into the main line of the accelerator now as you guys know uh black is cramped right that's the the main appeal of the marotzi is is white clamps down on black center making me essentially move around on the first three ranks that's not to everyone's liking but i like these kinds of openings so we take on d4 reposition the bishop and we start expanding on the queen side our idea is to go a5 a4 and then queen a5 and i actually think his move was a bit of a positional error and um the reason why is that he's trading a lot of pieces and from a space advantage perspective that's not the wisest thing to do but it's also not the wisest thing to do because he's going to leave himself with a pretty lame bishop now here's the thing in these positions can i ask you guys the following question could a case be made for the move e takes d5 is does this move contain any kind of sense and i'll tell you preemptively black is is doing well here but i want to use this opportunity to make an instructive what i think is a pretty instructive point what is the case that could be made for this move yeah miso superior correct on you the seven punt this week and there oh there's a classical game that is shown to all russian trained school boys if you want a little sneak preview to the russian school of chess this is shown to every little russian schoolboy and watch this ladies and gentlemen i'm going to run through this game very very quickly this is not a famous game i don't think many of you know this game and i don't mean to be condescending and i say that i just it's just not a very famous game unless you've been trained in the russian tradition but vinik against hola kevich bogmenick was 16 when this game was played he had learned chess at 12. and while this is not an accelerated dragon you get the same exact structure look at the morozzi structure and guess what happens knight d5 knight takes d5 e takes d5 not c takes d5 but he takes d5 now i want you guys to look at this and tell me what is the main difference between this position and e takes d5 in my why didn't i say that black was fine in my game but he's not fine here because no knight the key is that there is no knight i'm asking not specifically and henry did yeah so the key is that there is no knight in the c file well the c file is closed there too the knight in such a position can take all these outposts and it can essentially slice off the artery to the e7 pawn and that is the whole difference black has this lame dark squared light squared bishop and the result of this is that white just piles up on the e file look how classically he he does this now he pressures the queen city drives the pawn to b6 cements it trades off the rook on the c file blacks only trump guard now he gets a rook of his own to the c file and he finishes the game with what very pretty idea this ends the game and it's very fitting where this occurs because that's the whole bottom line point of this strategy queen e6 check if you don't trade queens white takes and promotes if you do d takes c6 and b7 and batman nick will promote his pawn upon is actually unstoppable nick against philip kievich very famous game well to russian uh players and you can see the idea very clearly defined here okay now you guys are all familiar with it and i'm actually very happy i'm really pumped that you guys are now aware of this game so let's compare that to this position it seems very similar but this knight could be either on e5 or on c5 uh promoting the queen side pressure and that makes all the difference okay so at this level when we when we hit 2000 uh it's all about making these subtle observations again the method of comparison comparing one position to another position what is different that helps you understand and categorize imbalances and that really builds your positional understanding when you're able to look at a position and detect the key difference uh then you get better at evaluating these kinds of positions okay so he played c takes d5 we take on d4 but and again if we go queen b6 here then uh this would be a good trade we're not for rook c7 very concrete and he goes so knight c5 bishop b5 a4 very important move otherwise he goes a4 now we put play queen b6 we improve our position with rook c8 we pin the bishop with queen b4 by the way a3 my intention was to go knight b3 anyway and uh the queen trade as we kind of saw in the game is beneficial for us now we could have locked everything up with that five first that would have been sensible but here i calculated some lines so had he taken first and gone a3 we still go knight b3 and this um it does matter which rook goes to see it how did i decide with casey because rick fc8 would have abandoned the king and i'm not saying i would have paid the price for it but something like f5 at some point could have been very scary at least here i keep a little security detail on my king right does that make sense a little bit of a general answer but hopefully that that's how i decided it now here there's a couple of important details if he moves his queen away reinforcing the attack on my queen there seems to be a pretty big problem this is what i had to see if i move my queen away he takes the knight and he wins a pawn but what key resource does black have here what key resource does black have here um one sec i'm writing down this this uh which rook yeah queen c5 is very important or queen d2s uh and uh this is fine and i calculated this that lime doesn't end there bishop takes b5 but it's only here that black demonstrates the important resource rook to b8 attacking the bishop winning b2 so without this move and that's what it boils down to why it would have been better so i calculated this he made it easy for us by trading immediately and his position just collapses we take take and now we're going to have three with a checkmate isn't knight d2 stronger uh maybe not sure windy two is also good so the the server is restarting uh so i'll take this opportunity to talk briefly about a question that bothers a lot of people which is um any questions by the way which is which rook to put on a particular course how do you decide what is the decision logic that you can apply um that you can apply in deciding which rook to put on a particular square now well you don't coin flip exactly so there's a couple of things the sort of baseline method that i well 2g6 allows queen takes d4 which is a separate line um the baseline method that i um that i propose to apply is to think about when you decide which rook to put on a square and you have a candidate move you look at the other rook you always look at the rook that's left out from a square and in doing so you try to assess whether that other rook will have any prospects uh or not because oftentimes so that's like method number one and then method number two you always have to factor in future ideas so method number one you try to find a position for both rooks uh you don't just myopic you look at one the second concept is you need to figure out what your long-term ideas are and long-term ideas can involve keeping your king safe as well as your opponents long-term ideas and sometimes it's very important for one rook to be in charge of being able to promote a long-term idea maybe that idea will occur 15 moves down the line but that could be a very viable reason to keep a rook on a particular square so those two things i would say uh formula you know sort of form the main basis for deciding but every situation is different and i don't want to oversimplify this is a very uh you know this is a very serious question so for example let's do let's do some very very quick practice in this just one one example this is going to be kind of tricky so bear with me please yeah so let's let's let's apply this logic precisely here with one of my games from 2015 my worst tournament ever i dropped like 30 points but i did win round one so in this position my opponent plays queen takes queen jq and a ls thing for the prime which rook should i recapture with rook a61 or rook after 81 let's think about this for a second and i'd like somebody to raise their head just kidding to make a case for which rook so i'm going to try to gauge the crowd here some of you think f most of you think a let's play the um you know what i'm going to play here beautiful time for this this this i'll give you guys another 15 seconds all right this is very fitting music all right so the answer is rook a takes d1 and i want to make it clear that the difference here is marginal but not everybody has detected the reason properly the queens are off the board so there's no reason to there's no reason to like think that black is going to ever attack my king black is not going to attack my king uh most likely so it's not that i need the rogue to defend the king but i asked myself where can i put this f rook and what i suspected would happen is that he would take the pawn on e5 and i would respond with bishop takes c5 but forecasting this uh into the future i recognize that the e file might get opened and guess what it would be perfect to put this f rook on the e file if i had taken with the f rook then the other rook would have to choose between these closed files and i never really anticipated any one of them opening in the near future so what happened i played knight d5 here boom boom boom the file opens and i didn't end up putting the rook on anyone but that's that's completely beside the point the point is i had this idea in mind and it it actually influenced his play and i won the game in the end okay not the ideal example but uh hopefully it it clarifies things for you guys a little bit exactly thank you i can't wait for him to get older so he slows down a little well you know i'm trying to keep things swift so it's entertaining but as i always say if there's something that you don't understand specifically i always encourage questions if you'd like me to repeat something that doesn't mean you're dumb it means you're invested in learning and i will never take it that way and nor should anyone else that's the whole point of this in the first place absolutely ryan so are you asking what plan i'd have here or something specific go ahead i always um disagreed with people who get annoyed when people repeat questions as long as it's not in a trolley way uh because it just means people want to make sure they understand something yeah ryan i'm i'm all ears so let me well i can use the opening but i don't know what to do after that oh so how do you plan in general is your question yeah so one of the biggest misconceptions about planning is that when like beginners think of grand masters they think of gm's having these 15 20 move plans these long like major plans and that's actually incredibly talk storm with five gifted thank you storm really appreciate that's a misconception mostly plans are two three four moves maximum and that's why i define the three move rule to say that any idea that takes longer three moves or longer is oftentimes going to be unrealistic uh because the position changes so fast in most cases at a grand master level that most plans consist of small maneuvers i want to trade this one piece i want to do this one small thing right it's like running an errand you're not planning for the rest of your life there are exceptions to that sometimes the position can be completely closed for example and you can afford to make a 10-move plan but those situations are definitely the exception rather than the role okay 43.75 i cannot believe it it's unbelievable thank you yeah thank you cezar ah something like 50 14 1500 i don't play pull up like this how do you determine whether it moves too passive no formula but you have to make a judgment call is it more important to defend your king or more important to just start attacking definitely ryan hundred percent they're 15 minute games 30 minute games minimum uh not that many i'll answer questions since the server is resetting guys now is your chance to ask some questions i don't memorize entire games though thank you phillipsburg well i've done previous streams where i talk about openings and i'll do that sort of separately why was playing king h8 a good preamp to move well because it got the king out of the diagonal king h1 got the king out of the a7 g1 diagonal so queen b6 wouldn't create discover check ideas so in the same ish um and this is the reason the same ish um it's 1am in california but it's 4am in north carolina which is the important part so in the same ish you usually um castle queenside which is what makes the same-ish quite unique among king's indian openings usually in the king's indian white castle's king side in the sameish in most cases white actually does castle queen said and go for checkmate so it's a very dangerous line
