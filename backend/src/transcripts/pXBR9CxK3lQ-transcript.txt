so i i'm hoping that you guys are are able to understand these games even though okay 2400 okay we're playing him again i don't mind that uh he's a good opponent so that's totally fine with me we can rematch [Music] same good that's fine that's fine i mean at this level okay he's thinking so so let's go um what should we do all right let's just go e5 let's let's see if he plays a rai lopez on us and then i'll be able to demonstrate how i play against the right lopez he does okay so um well the funny thing is i'm tempted to play the berlin and i'm tempted to show you guys a little bit about the berlin because a lot of people are very intimidated by the berlin and you shouldn't be intimidated by it so i know people are rolling their eyes at it but let me demystify a little bit for you guys why the berlin is so popular what makes it so good okay he plays anti berlin he plays d3 d3 defends the pawn that's the anti berlin and uh here the good thing for black is that i actually can so this bishop on f8 okay knight c3 is uncommon generally you want to leave space for the pawn to go to c3 so here we're just going to develop our pieces nothing nothing new under the sun we're just going to play bishop e7 and castle and after the game i'll give you guys a little bit of a run down on the berlin so he tries to do the same thing i did in the previous game okay but bishop b3 is inaccurate he should have followed this up with d4 this is too slow how can we make him regret this well d5 is decent but c5 is a buzz or russian okay permanently these are what we call the vampire teeth i think we formulated a new term someone in the chat did vampire teeth are super effective at stopping something and now we can simply develop our pieces without fear of him opening up the center what are the plans in this position well we have one very classic plan in these positions which is to well we have the two let's think about it this way we have the two bishops which means in general it would be good to open up the position so eventually what kind of move may allow us to open up the position and be careful because the move d5 is way too weakening way too weakening because e5 is going to fall out so the move is going to be f5 f5 ultimately we are going to prepare to open the file but and this is what i want people to understand we are not going to hurry with this first i want to complete my development okay and in order to complete my development i want to bring the bishop out to e6 but if we bring it out immediately then he's going to play knight g5 so what seems to be a good measured healthy move h6 yes that's also a good standalone move so that's the logic we're going to develop our bishop in and then we are going to move the knight and play f5 in addition we create an h7 square which could be used by the knight but let's not even rush up five let's see what he ends up doing okay can we make any other improving moves before we play before we move the night away because it's a good idea also to consider the drawbacks of moving this knight away if you think about the drawbacks of this of moving this night away yeah queen d7 is a good move one of the drawbacks is that it weakens the d5 square so i like the move c6 knight d5 is not that dangerous because we can take it but why not reinforce it with a pawn so we really don't have to worry about it h6 is not that we know h6 is not weakening that's only one small move he's castled on that side of the board so we don't have to worry about him going nuts with g4 okay this is he's grabbing space but that's all he's doing okay now we can we can play queen d7 we can connect the rooks but we can also get on with business let's you know guys let's get on with it let's move the knight away and play five i think we've done enough the reason i didn't play queen d7 is because i anticipate a future and i want you guys to tell me what the nicest space for the queen is now we've done this before in many when we play f5 a passageway opens up for the queen and this passageway is queen e8 queen g6 okay so we can play f4 and attack king's indian style but i don't see necessarily a reason to do that quite yet we can also go queen a queenie a queen h5 get bingo so we're trying to be flexible here um knight h7 is also well we keep the knight near the center i think that's that's the bottom line okay so let's get the queen into the game we are we are not committing to anything here uh i will okay so he takes what should we take with and actually this is not a trivial question but um hmm i actually like taking with the bishop and the reason why is a very specific one that i will explain after the game because we don't have much time actually he's threatening to force he's defending super well we are going to play now the move let me think this is not easy no sacking is not good hmm okay let's drop the bishop back let's prevent let's prevent g4 let's prevent g4 and now ultimately yeah that's why i'm moving the bishop back to to undo the fork uh and how do we how do we nurture our attack what how do we bring pieces and there's a very very classical typical plan in such positions which allows us to bring the heavy artillery in and that is okay i have to make moves we have to double up on the file so my apologies here in advance guys i'm going to play a little bit fast here because this guy is you can see that this guy is not folding i mean that's one of the things you see at this level is these people have stopped collapsing under pressure at least collapsing immediately if we continue applying the pressure then eventually you'll see that he he might blunder something but um yeah we can work on though we always have to keep in mind the sacrifice i will show after the game why the sacrifice is just very bad okay so we can just double rooks we don't need to do anything about this if he takes on e5 gray he opens up the file that's in our favor there we go mana monarch thank you brian okay so this is a bit of a trap move because if we take on f4 the bishop on e6 is undefended and he has knight takes d6 but ding ding ding ding he's put the rook and the queen on the same diagonal so we can see that bishop h4 is a possibility and i kind of blundered knight takes d6 which would be a really i don't know but then we take the rook anyway right we attack the queen now the point is that i want him to play g3 i really want him to play g3 because look at how much that would weaken his king side we would just drop the bishop back to where it came from and then the queen would immediately have access to h3 one of the the key properties of any attack is is this ability to introduce forcibly weaknesses in your opponent's position he's got a very five head move let's see if he plays it that move is queen to e2 okay so he does sacrifice uh now we do have to move the rook out of the the range of the knight so let's go rook f6 maintaining the connection of the rooks the rook can also swing as it will to g6 now the rook repositions on another very nice file okay that is a pawn that we are going to take to now open up the now we have an extra exchange it makes sense to open up files right okay now it is a simple matter of improving our piece placement marginally until we find an opportunity to capitalize now we do want to trade stuff right i don't mind trading stuff now um let's shift the rook over to d6 and attack this newly created weakness and uh let's dial the queen back to g6 in order to immobilize the rook and let's blunder upon while we're at it okay now i gotta focus a little bit we've got not a lot of time much much better here for black i should be able to win this game but um i want to make sure that i'm not losing this one on time yeah i'm giving up a little bit too much here yeah this is not great my technique here wasn't very good so let me just try to pull this one out guys he's he's playing this extremely well i have to say these guys are just like insane like beasts yeah i might end up losing this one actually i spent a little too long there dilly dallying around oh my god i'm blundering i'm i'm out of gas completely just blundered a rook yeah i'm gonna lose this one sorry guys that was my very bad technique i mean this was this was coming eventually no but this guy is just playing game of his life right now oh oh and i oh my god i've wanted me to i i didn't mean to make them okay yeah he he picked up the the pace after after after getting very bad position very nicely done what can i say i wonder who this guy is okay this guy is really strong so anyways um essentially yeah i mean everything was going well up until like at certain at a certain point you just started completely outplaying me um yeah d5 was correct so i mean basically everything here is pretty clear and then imperceptibly i started playing badly so bishop h4 is bad i mean knight d6 that was a misjudgment on my end yeah d5 was was just winning here d5 was just winning i mean knight g3 is the reason i rejected this but apparently after queen g6 black's just got a huge initiative like bishop h4 and okay g3 bishop takes g3 and um this was a misjudgment and i and here he played perfectly the rest of the game i mean every single move okay i mean black is black is better here but my pieces are all over the place and um i got low on time and uh yeah let's rematch him i want to beat him okay he's not on live chess yeah g5 i mean probably i should go here although it's already not that clear he gets a lot of activity yeah rookie six is good bishop d6 is perfect yeah d4 is the best move too i mean this move i didn't understand completely but apparently it's best and then queen e3 knight c6 is best i mean he gave me absolutely no chances at some point so the bishop sack was just not good enough i mean what can i say guys he's he should be 3000. so queen takes h3 uh queen e3 and um and and i just don't have any pieces in the attack i just don't have any pieces in the attack and um maybe he's doing a speed run too yeah i'm just gonna check this game and okay he's back he's back kudos to credit to him no no he's he's legit he's just he's just severely underrated so let's go knight f3 and then we'll analyze both okay let's play the another alpha okay so e5 is bad uh and e5 is bad for a simple for for a similar reason well it's five am i i guess i should also not underestimate my own poor quality of play this weakens the d5 fun it also weakens this diagonal so d4 just gives white an advantage as we already know so cdcd and um okay so he goes d5 himself okay that's clearly some sort of preparation so we're going to take on d5 how do we usually follow follow up here how do we usually follow up here yeah knight c3 i guess he's got bishop before but we can unpin ourselves with bishop d2 we can unpin ourselves with bishop d2 the point is we're attacking his queen we got the two bishops now okay that's a free pawn i don't know what he's doing okay let's just develop with bishop b2 we're just up a pawn now i mean white is much better queen to e4 hmm okay let's just keep developing with castles i guess rook d8 but then queenie won we have to maintain contact with the bishop okay queenie one we're up upon we just need to untangle ourselves he's super active yeah he is very active here hmm so how should we untangle ourselves what do you guys think so 92 blunders moving the night blunders the bishop yeah it's not easy i think we'll start with yeah he's a very tough opponent i should probably focus bishop d1 let's play bishop d1 let's get the bishop out because that bishop was the source of my problems the bishop was very poorly protected by the queen okay so he takes the queen that lightens the load a little bit and now we get an end game where i have very weak pawns all over the place but i am up a pawn so this should be should be winnable let's go h3 and now um let's go bishop c2 or maybe bishop b3 is a better idea uh contesting this bishop okay rook d3 we need to defend the spawn rook ac1 okay bishop h3 of bishop c4 hmm no well black is much worse no he is legit i mean completely legit just very good h a6 okay so now we need to improve our position um and we can improve our position in in a variety of ways it would be nice to get rid of this rook now bishop c2 is possible because rook takes c3 we have a check the problem with bishop c2 is i like this bishop where it is so what we're going to do is we're going to go nitrify we're going to try to force him to correct our pawn structure our pawns are going to get braces for free if he takes on b3 we're going to visit the orthodontist and uh we we like visiting the earth i mean i don't like visiting the orthodontist but pawns do i don't miss the orthodontist but the pawns do so knight f3 um now uh no no no no now let's move the king out of the well yeah let's move the king out of the way and now we're gonna go e6 now we're gonna go e6 yeah well i have nothing to smile about i lost that game now we're gonna open up the bishop rook e8 okay we're gonna take it this guy is good the reason this move is good is now okay now we must let me think guys this guy is like seriously good craig tucker i know that but the point of this is to be educational and i know i know it's annoying to people but normally i can trust me normally i can i can explain my moves against the 2400 and not get outplayed so now what we're going to do is we're going to bring the king over to e2 and and try to try to kick the rook away from d3 king e8 isn't is an odd move i don't really understand it now he gives us a chance to bring our king in okay knight d2 okay rook a one okay four i'll analyze both the last games i don't know thank you gigahertz for the sorry i missed that five gifted appreciate it my man okay now we're going to expand on the queen on the king side with f4 and we're going to try to exploit our upon majority here i mean it's very strange i mean it's just i'm having a very hard time like making progress against this guy okay defend the pawn back to f6 it might be because it's 5 am no i mean i'm allowed to compliment him he is playing really well i haven't gotten a plaque from youtube i mean it's not that important to me why compliment somebody on good play we're going to tr okay g6 h4 we're going to keep pushing the puns he's not lucky he's honey h5 he finds a way to inflect my pawns positively however he opens the g file okay now we're going to tuck our king over to c2 in order to buttress okay this one here i think we can go here and the bottom line is that we have a protected passer on c4 that is going to be very very strong here check oh sorry here he's going to check me go rookie 3 probably okay we need to win this fun otherwise he gets connected passers i think it's a draw unfortunately guys oh this oh my god now i'm probably like worse c2 i mean yeah i'm worse now i'm losing probably although it's not clear it's not clear what is king e5 you can now promote takes takes nc3d7 c2 takes takes c63 f5 d4 takes it's winning no it's winning now okay i'm not implying anything but this guy is very odd i mean it intersperses yeah that's a very strange move at the end to not approach the punt so let's let's look at the games guys i won't stand for any accusations um i'm uh you know the thing is it's a very tricky situation because again i i always like to say this ex nido imagine that you were him and okay perhaps you're you're good your rating doesn't reflect your strength and then you watch the stream and you have like 50 people cheating and you didn't cheat you just have this style and you just played well that kind of ruins your day so i don't want to ruin this guy's day now i'll be transparent in saying that what is odd to me is the fact that there is a huge delta between some some of the moves he makes are terrible absolutely terrible like not characteristic of a 2400 at all and then there are other stretches where he plays extremely well but that doesn't mean anything and that's certainly not grounds to conclude that he is cheating and that's just what i want to make clear so um i i i get that people are not trying to be disrespectful but uh this is not called evidence that's just something that's odd okay so in this first game right for example the smooth bishop e3 is um is just bad i mean d4 is the whole idea of taking on c6 that's the whole idea of taking on c6 so by playing bishop a3 he allows us to establish vampire teeth and stop d4 i guess vampire teeth can be good to be fair guys uh let me make a couple of things here since we're on the subject i don't mind sharing some thoughts on it here's the thing um people cheat for a variety of reasons and you cannot accuracy is a very bad indicator of whether someone is cheating there are cheaters who plug every move into the engine those are the most obvious ones there are also cheaters who who will play you know a stretch of the game with an engine then they'll turn the engine off and they'll turn it back on again or they will turn it on when they get frustrated at having a bad position um there are also people who try to disperse suspicion by playing the occasional blunder or they will deliberately make a horrible move here and there precisely to disperse suspicion that is what makes some cheaters so hard to catch because it's a very fine line you also don't want to falsely accuse people um i think that some people imply this guy fell into that category but uh there are very advanced methods and i do not have them so in the absence of those methods it's innocent until proven guilty there is this and i i would call this soft cheating where people cheat and they still maintain about the same rating uh and i don't know really what is in the minds of those people but you know sometimes it's out of frustration or it's the occasional crutch it becomes an addiction i think oh let me just check the computer here let me just check the computer there so this this categorical statement no way a human plays that way i mean do you know every human do you know what goes on inside of his mind you can't really say that there are moves which you can say no women will play that but you've got to be very careful before you say that i but i know that jimmy fallon and you know the picture of jimmy fallon and yeah it's a little bit odd but at the same time it's just it is what it is so in this game i think everything was clear right and let's try to understand when you lose a game you want to get to the bottom of what it is that went wrong exactly uh and i did everything perfectly up until this point so i think that the the um root of my mistake and this is a lesson that i will actually think about tonight uh as i lay in bed is the fact that when you see a tactical property i just got too cocky i did not stop to consider the drawbacks of the move bishop h4 so yeah we are applying for a new mod so the main mistake is that i basically i didn't stop to consider the drawbacks of the move and had i noticed that d6 would have been hanging i would have played d5 that solves the problem of the d-pawn so after bishop h4 things just get very very messy here okay and then i made a series of small mistakes to follow that up and and lost the game in the end right no i know you guys said d5 but it's not that i'm not listening it's just i i am making my own decisions at the end of the day some of you did call this move again i thought after d5 knight g3 i wouldn't get a chance to play bishop h4 now don't ask grandmother's rating is that is a dirty secret um so queen four queen g6 i guess the point is now bishop h4 is super strong yeah so okay and uh after that things got very very messy and in the game that i won uh the opening was very i mean it was odd this move97 just gives the pawn up that's another thing like i don't know i mean at least play e takes d4 or e4 and white is better in this position because i've got the two bishops but um this just gives the pawn up the key move really here was to play bishop d1 to identify what's wrong with the position the bishop on e2 is super weak and it's subject to attacks like knight f4 so bishop d1 takes the bishop on a defended square and this is to the point that not every one of your moves has to be super glamorous right your moves have to be functional they don't always have to be glamorous um so you know in this end game i kind of ground him down but he played very very well honestly guys i'm really tired i maybe i'll i'll talk about this end game tomorrow but i'll i will take specific questions about this game um yeah bishop d1 is hard to find because it's a retreating move retreating moves can be invisible moves here i wanted to open up the file basically and here i did something very similar to what i did in my first game against him right remember this position where i brought my king over to do something the king can be the king is like a mercenary it can be employed for these small tasks that may involve uh the main mouth chasing the rook away okay so that's like the the bottom line right the king is a we can consider a weak piece but it's capable of doing a lot of stuff getting a lot of stuff done and uh here we chase away the rook so that this rook is then able to move [Music]
