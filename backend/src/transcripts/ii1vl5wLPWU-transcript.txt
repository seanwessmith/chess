by the way this is the queen's gambit there there's been a little bit a little bit of a misunderstanding as to what the queen's gambit actually is queen's game does not involve sacrificing the queen queen's gamut involves sacrificing the pawn it's just on the queen's side of the board that's what it's called that way are you guys ready for a game let's get this party on the road let's go [Music] so we're seeking a game and we're playing gary ganoozi 1527 who has the same rating as me now i've been playing the sicilian defense recently in the speedrun he plays 92. uh it's a bit of a weird move because it obstructs the development of the bishop but it is a fine move we're not going to change our strategy on the basis of it okay so he plays the move c3 white is not developing his pieces he's moving a bunch of pawns so what we need to do with black is to develop our pieces quickly and strike in the center as early as possible so first we're going to develop our knight here thank you pietro or siri for the prime and we're going to attack a spawn on e4 now when i say strike in the center can somebody remind me what move specifically am i referring to when i say strike in the center we want to open up the center so that we can exploit our lead in development what we mean is the move d5 because well it literally opens up the center and we prepared the development of our bishop okay so he plays f3 now there are several ways to go about getting an advantage here we could continue expanding in the center which is what we're going to do let's continue expanding in the center with the movie five he goes bishop g5 to pin our knight to our queen we're going to unpin ourselves by developing our bishop and he's going to take so he's doing a bunch of very dubious stuff here thank you jay brain for the prime why are we better here because we've got superior central control he's played this incredibly weakening move f3 and the reason it is weakening as we know is because it creates these openings around white's king that are never desirable and so for that reason if people are thinking about pushing the pawn to d4 we shouldn't do that because that would close up the center we don't want to close up the center we want to open up the center so that we can better exploit the weaknesses he's created so for the time being we're just going to keep developing we're going to castle our king put it into safety we're going to see how he chooses to develop and tailor our device and he does our bidding for us he opens up the center for us now he's got a very weak pawn on d3 how can we attack that pawn i'm looking for two moves in particular how can we put more pressure on this pawn on d3 if we can play bishop f5 that's number one what's number two number two is rook d8 two for two guys very nice so let's get our rook to d8 why did i not develop the bishop first i'll explain that after the game there is a specific reason that i'm playing rook d8 and not bishop f5 um okay let me just make a note of this in my notebook all right now part of the reason is because i wanted to maintain the flexibility of developing this bishop and remember our main campaign here our main plan is to attack the pawn on d3 so can we devise a development scheme for the bishop so that it would pressure the pawn on d3 we can no longer develop our bishop to f5 this square is now covered but how can we deploy our bishop nonetheless to attack the pawn on d3 this will take two moves we can play the move b6 this has the added benefit of sort of supporting our central pawn which is always good people associate the move v6 with the fianchetto now he's gone c4 he's panicked why is the move c4 bad can somebody explain to me from a positional perspective why is the move c4 bad what what square does it weaken and what can we put on that square look at this juicy square and in fact here's the thing guys we can just play knight t4 we don't even have to move our queen because if he takes our queen then we take his and that's gonna be a fork against his king and his queen so that's why i always stress don't have those knee-jerk reactions to your moves because sometimes you can find something better if you don't make any assumptions now we're just gonna casually drop our queen back and uh now we have another very instructive move that we can make what do i see in this position what i'm seeing is this queen on c3 and i'm also seeing our bishop on f6 they are at a standoff which means that if this knight moves we are going to be very close very close to winning his queen but there's one obstacle to that which is the pawn on e4 so let's push this pawn out of e5 and then if he takes the pawn where are we going to move our knight in order to win the queen that is called a discovered attack or a discovered check we are going to put it on e2 and only on e2 because if we put it anywhere else then that's not going to be a move with check which means that he's going to have time to move his queen he smartly this guy is quite good decides to move his queen away now what should we do now we should play well there's a couple of moves that we can play let's just push our pawn to e3 let's keep expanding keep dominating and look at this beautiful pawn here right in his grill uh he's got to move his knight away and then we're just gonna move our bishop to e5 and can somebody devise a method of now supporting this pawn on e5 what are we going to do most likely on the next move in order to bring this pawn's neighbor to its support we don't need to do anything here let him be the one to take our knight yeah f5 let's go f5 let's push this knight away from e4 and then if need be we can play f4 and we can support the pawn on e3 as much as possible okay now what should we take with we were talking about supporting the pawn so with that in mind which piece or pawn should we take on d4 with we should definitely take with the pun because what better way to support a beautiful passpond which is a splinter in his throat than with another pawn another benefit that i may draw to your bring to your attention ladies and gentlemen is that let's get get out of here get out get out of a g5 is the fact that we've opened up the c file why is that important because his king is on the c file and why is it important that his king is on the c file because we can add pressure to the pawn on c4 because it's pinned how can we do that how can we do that we can play the move b5 we can start to chip away at the defenses surrounding his king if we take on c4 and we're going to have connected past pawns ooh now this pawn is very weak how can we attack this pawn we can bring in another piece to attack this fun on c5 it's a very typical way to sort of exploit the drawback yeah rook d5 bringing in the heavy hitters this is going to be pretty pretty over i can't believe we have 4 000 viewers right now welcome everybody okay so he pins our rook we don't need to rush in taking the pawn let's first deploy our bishop to e6 also creating a standoff which we threaten to exploit by taking on c5 of the rook so he's best advised to move his king out of the way but it's not going to matter look at how overwhelming our position is here all of our pieces are in the game this game is over thank you of mice and men 7 for the prime appreciate everybody's support we are on the path to 4 000 subs which i can't believe i'm saying uh amazing stuff thank you guys we're just gonna infiltrate with a rook to the second rank uh also this prepares the move e2 and oh we got enough we got more gifted subs uh we have more gifted subs from gem gem taco another five big ones thank you so much are you guys ready for well what do i always tell people in this situation what i always tell people in this situation is do not forget to bring each and every one of your pieces into the game okay uh and which piece of ours do you notice is not in the game vietcong 47 thank you for the sub that's definitely proffer definitely the rook look at this beautiful alekhine's gun we've constructed alakine's gun named after former world champion alexander alakine from the soviet union i was talking a little bit earlier about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death rumor has it that he died by choking on a piece of meat can i procure the photos i can as he's thinking i'm going to show you the scene from alekhines well i'll show that to you later but first in such a position all of our pieces are playing what do we need to look for when all of our pieces are playing we need to look for tactics what that means is we need to we need to make the the position of our opponent's king explode anonymous you're thinking we can do that with rook takes we could have also taken his bishop there's a million ways to win here but the simplest is just to pave the way for our queen now to go into c2 and deliver checkmate on a2 this is a relatively simple combination that's what a combination is it's a sequence of moves that generally involves a sacrifice um and let me just find something interesting for a second if you guys can bear with me oh alekhine yeah this is going to be hard to find from this book but alexander alakin one of the earliest world champions of chess had a very interesting life story and an interesting death story as well okay mysteries it might be in this section if you guys just give me a second alekhine's death let's see if i can find it here yeah gary okay recollection of malachi and alakan alakan yeah it's not going to be here anyways i'll look for it later i'll look for it later it's on the internet of course yeah i'll just find it on the internet actually because it's pretty cool i think for for a lot of people chess history is kind of cool thank you a bunch of numbers for the sub to make it but i also shouldn't show photos of like dead people uh so maybe we'll do that later thank you so much for the sub um i don't know about that i think we got we got some younger members of the audience okay so what i normally do after playing a game like this i usually play in batches of two or three but sometimes when a game is particularly rich i i go through it immediately right and i answer everybody's questions about the game i want to make sure everybody's included and i want to make sure no matter what level you are you learn and you you don't feel shy about asking questions that's the environment that we're trying to build in this community okay so let's quickly go over this game and maybe play one more basically what our opponent was not doing in the opening and a lot of people that at this rating range right we're 1500 and i think ux algorithms for the prime are um they play these moves that are just subpar right he's not developing his pieces he's putting his pawns on weird squares and so what we do in return is we just grab control of the center while also developing our pieces to very good squares and he played bishop g5 pinning our knight to our queen what is a pin a pin is when a piece of lesser value stands behind a piece of higher value and there's an opponent's piece that's skewering both of them uh so we can't move essentially we cannot move the knight without losing our queen there are exceptions to the rule sometimes you can move a pin piece for several reasons and so and pin ourselves and he took enough sticks that's a bad move this violates the principle of not moving a piece more than once in the opening but there's no need for him to trade that bishop in fact he now creates a lot of weaknesses around his dark squares which are even further weakened by the fact that he doesn't have a dark squared bishop anymore so he should have probably just tried to develop his pieces at least made an attempt to do so um but but by not doing that he exacerbated the situation and he further exacerbated by taking on d5 why was this move bad because it opened up the center for us because we have elite development that's very important now the move b6 deploying our bishop to a6 in order to attack the pawn on d3 how do we find this move well we want to identify the main weaknesses in our opponent's position we want to try to exploit them right so here we look at the pawn on d3 clearly it's very weak we have a lot of our pieces staring at it another good way to identify weaknesses look for pawns that cannot be defended by any other puns if you see a pawn and you notice that it cannot be defended by any other puns then chances are you want to pile up on it right because your opponent is going to have to waste peace resources to uh to defend it and instead he decided to shut down the potential of bishop a6 but in return he he created this massive hole on d4 and um now we played the very important move e4 opening up the skewer possibility against his queen again if he takes on e4 we give a check this check sacrifices the knight but it exposes the attack on his queen and we win a queen console asks why not bishop f5 in which position may i ask yeah so bishop f5 why not uh because after knight e4 he basically shuts down the bishop right this knight on e4 acts as kind of a rock and the bishop loses its effectiveness that's the reason why we wanted to deploy our bishop through a6 and not through f5 thank you internet police for the two months really appreciate it man these subs are incredible mm-hmm you guys appreciate it very much and basically that's how we won the game after that he we drove our pawn into e3 we supported it with oh we got five more subs from gem gem taco incredible this level of support is extraordinary thank you gem jam we've got right about the same amount of subs as viewers and that's saying something thank you so much also i know you took with a seat button to open the file but what would what would have been the advantages of taking on the pawn on before with the bishop instead of the pawn yeah that's a great question so another critical moment occurred here right we could have also taken with the bishop it's one of those cases where everything is good the issue is it keeps the position a little bit closed right by taking with the pawn we open up that artery to his king which we're able to exploit by playing b5 here white can sort of keep things close together and the board is frozen i see that sorry about that folks it's been a persistent glitch recently what i was explaining is that there is a reason that we took on d4 with a pawn and we did that in order to open the c file we could have also taken with the bishop this would have created a very strong outpost for the bishop but it would have kept the position a little bit closed uh which which is not in our favor because his position is so crippled in general but we could have played a6b5 for it to chip away at the queen side this is also quite overwhelming for black okay was bishop f4 followed by it to a bad move yeah so we could have also we could have done that thank you oh zan holy smokes stand 13 with 1200 bits uh we could have tried to set him up here by playing bishop f oh that would have been an interesting move because we attacked the knight and we prepared a discovered attack with e2 but knight h3 would have followed and he would have attacked the bishop that's giving that attack initially at the end of the day we have an extra rook for a night which which is called an extra exchange but that's not the best that we can do that's just not the best that we can do and i want to encourage people that when you're look when you're thinking about a position there's two pieces of advice that i have to share the first is if you have two moves that you want to play one move followed by another move you always have to ask yourself what happens if i play the second move first and in this case what if we play e2 first we sacrifice the pawn and only now do we go bishop f4 and now we simply win his night we we end up up a p so that would have been a fantastic move the second thing is do not cash in too soon okay there's some positions where people see oh i can win a pawn i can win a night but the reality is you should always be you should always be aiming for the most ambitious outcome of any position do we want to just win a measly exchange sure absolutely not we want to go for more than that we want to go for checkmate so you want to ask yourself what am i going for in a particular position that can help you not cash in too soon okay let's play one more let's play one more unless anybody has any questions because i want to keep things dynamic but we're already up to 15 35 we're up to a very solid rating and we're moving our way up to 1600 all right let's go why i'm happy to provide okay we're playing a 1700 that's a pretty serious opponent let's play the italian which i've been playing okay so d6 is a very calm move it's also not a great one because it obstructs the development of the bishop those of you have been watching the speed run how do i like to proceed in this position how do i like to proceed in this position how do we occupy the center well there's two ways to do that we can go d4 immediately or the alternative as people are suggesting is to prepare the move d4 with c3 i personally like to occupy the center with pawns so that's sort of my general um that's sort of my general approach and so we can just go d4 i don't really care about his spin i mean it's it's just totally fine and now we have a look at this beautiful pawn center that we have uh this pin is annoying but it's nothing that we can't deal with because we've developed our bishop to a very nice square where it's sort of pressuring the f7 pawn okay so our opponent decides to pressure two things at once which one is the most important to defend well it's clearly the d4 pawn we need to lend some support to this d4 pawn how do we do that while developing one of our pieces how do we do that while developing one of our pieces we can play bishop to e3 exactly why are we not afraid of bishop takes f3 doesn't this ruin our pawn structure well it's exactly what he's wondering that's a very typical mistake at this level pawn structure is this sort of irresistible you know i don't know it's it's like the scent that people fall for but the reality is it doesn't tell the whole story because if you look at our pawn structure right the pawn on f3 may look ugly but the reality is it supports the pawn on e4 so this is a pretty robust pawn chain the second thing is we have an incredibly not only do we have an incredibly strong center but we have a lead in development and we have two bishops and furthermore the light scored bishop is uncontested so by just developing our pieces we're going to get a tremendous initiative here we can also repurpose this pawn and push it forward and prepare the pawn break e5 i could uh jose but a queen shade would would be not desirable because he's underdeveloped that would help him mask the problem of his underdevelopment let's centralize our knight which i like to do quite frequently queen b3 would have also been possible and it it is possible well let's just bring our pieces into goods onto good squares i'm going to bring the rook onto this semi-open file just so it can pressure the knight later on let's see what he does let's see what mr victor does and he goes knight f6 and that would be a good time for queen b3 we can definitely set up some stuff along that file but um yeah our king is fine in the center i i think then this is where people have to understand you don't you're not obliged to castle uh there's no higher authority that forces you to castle if your king is safe in the center then your king is safe in the center okay and very often it is and very often i see people rushing to castle when you could just keep your king in the center for the time later on if we need to castle okay we can castle here we can tuck our king away on h1 and it's still going to be safe but you don't need a castle yeah black doesn't have any pieces developed okay we're going to play bishop takes d5 now what are we attacking here boom boom we're attacking this pawn and that actually is checkmate and we're attacking the pawn on b7 sort of morphe style he has no way of develop of defending both of them at the same time he is busted and he runs into checkmate can somebody tell me it's checkman in two moves this is the pattern that you guys should definitely remember boom and king and queen e6 sending in the queen and guess what guys the reason i put the rook on c1 i knew this rook would be good and it is it's the key instrument and why this is checkmate the king cannot escape on c6 because we put a rook on c1 so when you bring your pieces into good squares you get rewarded for that even if i didn't know that this would happen exactly i didn't calculate this line okay i want to be very clear but i know that when i put pieces on good squares good things tend to happen okay so what happened in this game um what happened in this game is very simple he started badly by playing d6 that's just not a very active move it kills the development of this bishop and the reason i like c3 is not only that it prepares d4 and supports that with the pawn but also it opens up this avenue for our queen where i can simultaneously attack two pawns at the same time we could have even done that right up here we could have gone queen b3 we could have forked the two pawns but i decided to sort of stick to the general strategy sorry about that decided to stick to the general strategy of playing d4 and his main mistake was this move bishop takes f3 he should have probably either castled long maybe he should have developed his knight but instead he took on f3 which does our bidding for us and he continued to waste time there's no need to play a6 here he can't afford these kinds of moves he falls further behind the development and that's why we burned him here here rook c1 bringing the rook into the game and then queen b3 is a very simple move knight a say one second thought i smelled some smoke knight a5 is also possible but then we can take on f6 and follow up with what move loose pieces drop off which means that one move becomes possible here what move becomes possible in this position it's simply queen a4 check that's a fork and if he drops his knife back to c6 we can go d5 and by the way if he goes b5 trying to counter fork you can just take on b5 remember the rook on a8 that's a very important piece to pay attention to because you know it often remains undefended in these kinds of positions boom boom the game is basically over that's how we won the game he of course well the lesser evil probably would have been to defend this pawn although he is completely lost um and aha another five gifted from gem jam taco this is extraordinary thank you gem jim 35.99 lucky subscribers to the channel and i am the truly lucky one that is incredible thank you thank you jim jim and uh this nighttime hype is real we've got 3 500 viewers hope everyone's enjoying and oh here we go we got a bunch of numbers gifting five subs everybody jumping on the train thank you a bunch of numbers for the five as well to no friction amc am mcdonald's hs 74 hyde reception and jacobian 100 bits curious oh my god this is unbelievable happy thanksgiving ladies and gentlemen curious chimpanzee another five man i i have a feeling that people like the speed run thank you so much curious chimpanzee another five gifted okay so are there any questions about this game or should we move on to the next one this community is incredible 3609 no say decios with the with a prime and gains train 13 with the with the uh tier one with the seven months thank you man all right let's go let's go again and i didn't castle again remember you don't always have to castle that that's not a rule of chess why not queenside castle yeah i'll answer that hey man the hero of today man broughty caro down to 33.50 uh he's my boy okay so this guy plays the perk defense which is d6 and g6 this is called the perk and the reason that the perk gets a bit of a bad rap is because obviously our opponent has granted us control of the center and in the perk one of white's key strategies thank you mujo a for the prime one of the key strategies in the perk is for white to castle queen side the reason the white castle's queen side has stephen stromboli gifting five subs again holy smokes thank you man is because we want to attack on the king side and we can't really attack on the king's side if that's where we're castled so in order to castle queenside we have to clear clear the path for the king to come to c1 we do that by positioning our bishop and our queen on d2 and e3 there's an added benefit to doing this what is that added benefit what can we do with this battery thank you steven stromboli for keeping the hype going incredible stuff here we can play the move bishop h6 and we can knock out forcefully forcefully knock out our opponent's strongest piece his bishop that's the piece that's going to supervise the attack but we don't need to do it yet we are under no obligation to hurry with trading on g7 how do we start the attack on the king side how do we rip open the files and the avenues on the king side what do we do let's go with h4 we got to take the hammer to black's position otherwise we're not going to have the necessary you know steven stromboli subbing himself now it's very important to point to a couple of things here okay knight h5 what do we do now how do we get rid of his knight how do we get rid of it yeah g4 get out of here get out we don't want him here let's go get out of here back to f6 and then we can actually just play h5 and keep attacking we also but but we're not going to do that we're going to play a little bit more in a measured fashion we're going to play in more measured fashion here i want to defend this pawn i don't want to let his knight if if he comes back to f6 i don't want to let his knight capture g4 that leads to some complications we're just going to play the move f3 to defend that pawn and then we're going to play h5 yeah so we're just chasing his knight away and what is our ultimate goal in a position like this our ultimate goal is to open up the h file because that's the artery to black's king otherwise we're not going to get to black's king uh okay so let's play f3 i could have also sacrificed upon as men is indicating but i want to sort of show the importance of patience when you're attacking and then sometimes eliminating okay so what do we do here how do we conduct ourselves in the center do we want the center to be open or do we want the center to be closed given that we're attacking on the king side we certainly want the center to be closed why do we want the center to be closed because if the center is closed then it's easier for us to attack on the king's side that's how you want to reason when it comes to opening or closing the center it's not rocket science right if you're attacking on one side of the board and the center is open there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff going on in the center you're not going to have the attention necessary to pay to the the side that you're attacking on when the center is closed you buy yourself a bunch of time and now we once again transition back to our plan of opening up the king side okay and you guys are doing great all right yeah people zlo is very very high i have to say no this is awesome okay so he goes g5 he's trying to keep things as closed as possible what do we do with the spawn what should we take it with and this is just the winning move yeah absolutely queen takes we threaten checkmate how does he defend the bishop he has only one way of doing that he's got to drop his knight back but then he gives up his queen and we're gonna have an extra queen and we're gonna be winning oh he does this okay now we could take with a rook we could but but let's take with the queen i want to preserve the queens on the board even though i personally would have taken with the rook because that would have won a second piece but i want to i want to take the hammer to him thank you jam jam for another thousand bits wow non-stop non-stop all right um so let's see what black does here he's down a piece he's getting crushed along the h file and he finds a good move i actually underestimated this move he brings his queen into the defense it's fine we're still up a piece now what do we do here how do we re-structure our pieces well we need we need fresh blood and we need to not forget to develop our pieces and complete our development so let's complete our development let's castle and then one thing that we can do is we could position this night we could send it over to this weak square on f5 to open up the g file yeah let's do it let's get this knight all the way to f5 to dislodge the queen or if he takes on f5 we open up another file we can potentially later let's stop the pawn from progressing any further by the way he's doing a good job here he's trying his best to stir things up on the queen side problem for him is it's not fast enough okay not even close so this is called a maneuver and by maneuvering the knight to f5 we either force him to trade and open up the g file we're going to put a rook on the g file and we're going to do that by moving our bishop out of the way and taking a spawn there's no stopping rook g1 the rook g1 is going to be absolutely crushing um this game is over because he's either going to lose his queen or get checkmated or both most probably both and um great so that was a nice game that was a nice attack that was a very traditional perk attack and there was nothing extraordinary about it we just sort of did the things that that we're supposed to do and then we won okay um let's see how black well let's see if our opponent well we're king h8 whoops oh it was a metal slip guys i meant to put the other rook on g1 but let's turn this into something good shall we it doesn't matter we can always just move my rook back to h1 and he's basically gonna have to move his queen back to g7 i guess he can play h6 but yeah so he finds a way to prolong the game um now let's just say let's trade queens and win the game that way this is not the best but this is fine because now we're actually still checkmating him even though it's the end game we have checkmate in two moves we have checkmate and two moves can somebody spot it f6 we can check his king force it backward and deliver mate on h8 so even though we traded queens it doesn't matter it's still mate we're still in good shape okay great checkmate good game okay um so what happened in this game how could he have how should he have defended should i mean does the perk lose no it doesn't it certainly doesn't lose castles is already i think according to modern theory and accurate because it walks right into this attack right it walks right into the heart of white's attack which is to play bishop h6 and h4h5 now what should he have done i think what black should have done is immediately tried to assault our center because the faster black can get to the center the harder it is for us to continue the attack on the king side so for example if we stubbornly play h4 and he puts his knight on c6 then he can already take our bishop and he can take our pawn and this introduces some intrigue into the position because he's now threatening to capture on c2 so this is you know this is a little bit complex so we need to pay attention to to the center we maybe need to castle and then maybe he strikes with e5 so something like this to try to you know to try to mix things up a little bit in the center and distract white's attention from the attack that's what he should have done how do you respond to nitro iv we had a question about this move we can just move the bishop out to g5 i certainly don't want to give it away this bishop is precisely the instrument that's allowing us to attack with the greatest possible strength so we would keep it on h4 on g3 and then chase the knight away from g4 okay why not c5 before knight c6 yeah that is also possible you can go he goes you can go c5 there thank you yar 33 for the six months appreciate it i've played the perk myself here comes h4 g4 attacking his knight get out of here f3 to defend the pawn and now the key move in the whole game to close the center right if we kept the center open let's say we gone h5 instead then after e takes d4 things already gets super complicated we can't take on d4 right remember our bishop is hanging so we're gonna have to manage this new opening of the center with the fact that we're trying to attack why not bishop b2 instead of f4 well we never played f4 oh you mean why not f4 so this is the austrian attack the austrian attack is another variation of the perk where white occupies the center in as aggressive of a way as possible very much possible vary this is the main line um yeah knight g4 is possible as i explained but uh we can we can keep this bishop safe by by sort of maneuvering it along along this path over here okay so that's how you attack in the perk you just go bishop h6h4 and it's as easy as one two three by the way if he would have moved his knight back to e8 we would have just captured on d8 okay and and that would have been a free queen probably that was a little bit more resilient than what he ended up doing but um it's still completely lost why can't he just trade his bishop for yours well he can but that's the entire point of what we're trying to do here when he trades his bishop for ours not only does he no longer have this very crucial piece on g7 which was skewering sort of attacking our position the second thing is if you look at his king just visually it's weak right and all that remains for us is not to open up the h file and we're going to have uh very very good attacking chances
