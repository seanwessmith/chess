excellent let's begin i might have to grab my copy after the game speed run day 18 000 we are over 2100 let us begin okay mr nwa oh he's a sub to my channel okay let's go d4 uh i've mostly been playing e4 but i do want to play d4 in this term by the way is the audio quality okay i'm not using my mic right now if it's if it's uh grainy then i'll i'll bring my mic okay it's fine okay so c4 uh and he is playing the king's indian defense ladies and gentlemen we are playing now against the king's indian okay so what do i recommend to players in the 2100 rating range against the king's indian i recommend the sameish variation and to those of you who are not familiar with it i will explain it in detail after the game the same-ish uh is denoted by the move f3 what is the idea of f3 well you guys have might have seen this move before on the sicilian what is the idea who can tell me what white's next move is andrew tang by the way is a specialist in this line well we're cementing the pawn on e4 what move do we follow this up with so well we don't play d5 that's that's a little premature what we do well we develop our bishop to e3 yes h4 is ultimately going to be the idea the sameish is the only line in the king's indian where white usually castles queenside now you could castle queenside in other lines but in this line that is sort of the main line theory so typically we play f3 for two reasons we cement our central control number two we stop him from harassing our bishop with knight g4 that's very important knight g4 as you guys know can be a very nasty move in these positions and we don't want to give away this bishop unless it's for this bishop so what our opponent has done is gotten kind of an accelerated dragon type structure and um this is not the best way to respond against the same ish now white is just solidly better i've got now a positional advantage on top of my tactical advantage so how should we continue yeah queen d2 is good here we could have also dropped our knight back to c2 to prevent the trade but the trade isn't bad for us and one very important decision that as white we're gonna have to make here i've talked many times about flexibility what you have to be able to do at a high level is begin the game with one plan but stop on a dime and shoot a three-pointer you were planning to make a layup now you're gonna shoot a three-pointer what that translates to is the ability to let's say castle short and say you know what now we have a positional advantage we're not going to go for the immediate checkmate anymore but rookie is a bit of an empty move and because rookie 8 is a bit of an empty move i'm going to allow myself to castle long and we're making our intentions perfectly clear i am going to go for his throat in very conventional fashion h4h5 open up that h file and go for checkmate we've done this before in openings such as the perk okay let's go uh there's no need to delay let's go h4 we're of course going to sacrifice that pawn that's the whole point of this attack um is he well okay what would be the russian school of chesma in this kind of position who can tell me what the russian school of chess move would be so the russian school of chess would be king b1 right king b1 as many of you guys know is a very healthy move to play in uh positions where you've castled long why do you play it you play it uh and let's actually play it you play it because this king is just a lot safer on the b file if black puts a rook on c you guys can see how if the king remittle there we go prophet if only we had a prophecy okay now i will assure you that the attack will proceed a lot more smoothly now that the king is safe the king is not globally safe it's just that we've bought ourselves some time it's harder to get to this king and we're going to have more time ourselves for the orchestration of the king side attack now we've got to be very careful here what should we do who can tell me the move here so there's a little bit of a wrinkle here because if we go g4 and we say get the hell out of h5 where can the knight go black has a very nasty response to that black is a very nasty yeah knight g3 is very nasty because it attacks the rook and he might take the bishop so in the spirit of preparing slowly and attacking fast here's what we're going to do we're going to drop our knight back to b3 uh basically i'm reducing the tension on the d4 square i'll explain this in more detail after the game i'm forcing the queen to move and depending on where the queen moves i'm either gonna uh you know proactively defend the g3 square to prepare g4 or uh if the queen moves to if the queen moves elsewhere uh we might even sacrifice the exchange on h5 or we might go bishop h6 i don't know if this move makes sense to people what we're essentially doing is eliminating this tension on the d4 square so that we can as they say in russian untie our hands to attack with a in more single-minded fashion on the king side right we don't have to worry about all these trades let's see where he goes also we're forcing uh oh robert lost that sucks i mean robert and i partners in crime and we've experienced some pain in this tournament damn that's that's very sad robin robert and i are gonna cry together okay so if he takes on c3 then we take back and we've eliminated his most important piece even at the cost of our pawn structure that's more than worth it uh but let's focus on the game guys so yeah playing on both sides of the board so is everything i'm doing so far making sense there's a lot going on in this position i know that some of you guys are feeling a little bit overwhelmed so much going on we've sacrificed upon but fundamentally uh the battle is revolving around who checkmates which side first right we're going on the king's side our opponent's going on the queen side there's nothing mysterious about that nor should there be and this gets my alarm bells going because one thing that people forget to do just because a move didn't work at some point doesn't mean it doesn't work now so let's consider the move g4 g4 knight g3 but because the queen has repositioned itself to the center where it's maximally vulnerable what move becomes possible after g4 knight g3 bingo stefan selmar chess bishop f4 forks the queen and the knight now it's sort of a fake fork because he can take on f1 and attack our queen but remember what was our initial goal our initial goal wasn't to win anything it was just to get rid of that knight so that we could again untie our hands so that we can finally reposition our own queen to the h file and deliver checkmate along h2 we are a lot closer to our goal than our opponent is to doing anything to our queen side our queen side is still completely intact and aren't you guys thankful that we got our king away from that c file so we don't have to worry about any of that crap now here comes queen h2 here's johnny and now it's big time trouble for black because queen takes h7 while that's not checkmate immediately it's going to be checkmate in just a couple moves so black does have ways of staving off the mate but in my estimation we have so many pieces now geared toward the king side we're gonna made him in a couple of moves here black can hold out for a little bit but he's busted and also the queen is is very bad here it's just stuck in the middle of nowhere okay now there's a very very typical idea i want everybody to remember queen h8 would be checkmate but wait a minute it's not checkmate because there's a bishop here next question in our mind can we get rid of that bishop yes we can we can go bishop h6 and we natured is still checkmate because of the pin simple attacking game and he didn't even touch our king our pawn structure remained completely attacked i didn't even play this perfectly um i think i made a couple inaccuracies but it was good enough to win so the same ish with f3 right um when was this move first played i'd like to give you guys a little context as to when these moves were first played to give you a little historical knowledge remember that the king's indian didn't really gain prominence until the 1920s 30s when the hyper modernist came around people did experiment with it in the 1800s but they're mostly left laughed at it was first played in the year 1925 by samich so the same issue is one of those openings which is actually named for the guy who played it first friedrich i think he was austrian uh grand master in later life very strong player one of the leading players in the world really in the 20s 30s 40s and he played it twice in 1925 and 1926 and then um yeah and then it was played throughout the 20s 30s it gained prominence very very quickly samis played a lot a lot of same issues wait wait i'm not showing anything no no i'm just i'm just talking about it guys guys guys relax i'm just talking about it i'm not actually showing any moves i was just saying when it was first played um so just to recap what is the idea of the sandwich two ideas number one we protect the pawn on e4 remember what i said about uh playing against opening such as the king city it's not about the amount of the center that you control it's about how well you control it so it's very important to make sure that our central pawns are well protected by our pieces and other pawns so that's why we play these two moves our bishop protects the d-pawn our pawn protects the e-pawn and relax then relax and we of course prepare to castle long and go h4h5 c5 actually happens to be one of the best lines this is a again but this is a pawn sacrifice and taking the pawn is possible but it leads to some wild complications uh black is actually fine here i'm not gonna delve into the detail just trust me uh this is fine for black that's why we left this a lot and c takes d4 was i would say a pretty serious inaccuracy um the reason it is in inaccuracy is because it it allows us to get this kind of morozi bind it releases the tension and instead of this knight c6 would have kept the tension and applied pressure on the d-pawn and the thing is that if we go d5 uh where can this knight now migrate to and i've told you guys this logical thinking many times when a pawn advances in the center the immediate question you want to ask yourself which squares are now weakened it's e5 yeah it's e5 well knight d4 would blunder the pawn right one two three i would just take it twice so knight e5 would be the move attack in the pawn now the theory goes knight c1 and black can strike in the center with these kicks this is kind of a benoni style way of playing there is a lot of theory here welcome in there's a lot of theory here so uh we're not going to delve into this but c takes d4 gives us a pretty easy life i would say knight takes d4 2 and here we decided to cancel law if he had gone bishop d7 if he had gone bishop d7 we would have probably gone bishop b2 and castled short which would result in kind of a morozy bind like position that we've had actually with the black with the black side uh because we played the accelerated dragon sorry but rookie is kind of a waste of time so we cast along and we begin the attack h4 and now king b1 so does this move make sense to everybody um i i want this the the idea behind king b1 to make sense is it absolutely necessary to play this move could we have also considered h5 absolutely this is a judgment call this isn't like an obligatory move but it's a good idea to play this if you do have the time for it because you might be thankful later also if the attack you know fails and you screw up you might have that insurance of having the king on a safer square which would buy you more time later in the game yeah that's sad so now we go h5 sacrificing the pawn and here was the critical moment in the game why not knight b3 that would have also been good by the way i considered it queen before though would have been a little bit pesky and you can't go a3 because you wonder the knight so i was um slightly concerned about this now why couldn't we play g4 well the problem here is knight g3 as i explained attacking the rook and if the rook moves away then black takes the bishop and you might look at this and say well what's the big deal we give up the bishop no nbd no big deal but the problem isn't actually that black has taken the bishop what is the problem in this position uh i'm looking here for a very subtle observation actually um i'm looking for a subtle observation about the way that white has rearranged his position now first of all c4 is very weak and black can attack this but there's another observation yes metropolitan i'd gift you a sup for that queen can't be in front of the rook okay and in this position it's very important for the queen to lead the attack because if you have it the other way around it's not that this isn't strong but this isn't checkmate and it'll take you a while you have to get another rook to the h file then you have to move the first trick away this is a lot more cumbersome than having the queen in front as we saw so this move knight g3 really shakes things up on the king side and not in a good way that's why we go knight b3 first of all thank you aquila gifting to metropolitan and now after queen e5 we go g4 using the queen in order to force him to give up the knight for the bishop okay so rook d takes f1 and now we nh2 repositioning the queen why didn't he take a rock because then he loses his queen right we attack his queen and his knight this is a fork so we would have won his queen and then we would have come back around for the night um the their black did have a way to stave off checkmate and he could have done that by playing h5 forcing white to get a pawn on the hval but this this pawn is not going to remain there for very long we're just going to take on g6 and because black hasn't even gotten the engine started on the queen side uh there's no doubt in my mind that this would result in checkmate okay yeah 985 is also a pretty good move uh that's also a theoretical line so no that's just the cars how could black of defender from mate so this is the way to stave it off but not for very long um so any questions about the way in which we conducted this attack i mean i can show you guys just by a chest-based search a million games where the attack succeeded precisely in this way in the same ish it's incredibly common to have an attack end with checkmate along the h file precisely in this manner let me actually do a little a little search and see what i can find isn't rookie 8 good because it yeah so that's tranquil see that's the idea but but it's to it's simply too slow um and in the dragon by the way that's another opening in which you often get this kind of attack so here's a good example one moment just looking well here's a here's a moment from a game of julio sedora grand master from dallas texas um watch what he does so let me reposition this to a chess-based scene basically we join in a samish this is the same as julio sador against tyler hughes strong player and watch what julio does in this position so he buys himself some time here's bishop h6 trying to trade the bishop black dips his bishop away to h8 and now julio after taking the pawn orchestrates a very strong maneuver what is white's ultimate goal in this position what does white want to achieve ultimately like what is on white's wish list and if you paid attention to my game you would know what particular thing i'll check well how do we get mate what will be necessary queen in front of the rook so we want the queen on h2 now watch what julio does bishop c4 paving the way for the queen but he doesn't go immediately to h2 first he clears the path by moving the bishop away now he still doesn't go queen h2 he's a little bit worried about this knight getting loose so he moves the knight away sacrificing the other knight and now he goes queen h2 and after rookie six how does white deliver checkmate by force in a couple of moves white to play and deliver checkmate i'm going to grab my coffee as you guys are thinking this concept pattern recognition is thrown out a lot this is what pattern recognition is mark baretzky the famous chess trainer even recommended for his students to have a notebook where they literally wrote down all of these patterns they would cut out diagrams and glue them into the notebook and this would be a collection of tactical themes this is one such theme this is how you get better at attacking in your openings by learning concepts like these now you guys will not forget this idea of trading bishops the queen on h7 and if black have gone king e8 that would have been nominally more resilient but i guess bishop takes b5 would have happened and now we transform the advantage and win the queen black decided to just let julio give checkmate no it's it's no no he saw this he was just being graceful um allowing julio to check me of course he saw this tyler is a very strong player actually okay so let's play e4 this time showcasing the whole range of repertoire and this time well let's continue playing shall we continue playing the alopen or shall we switch things up a little bit let's switch things up let's play the open sitzillion let's play the openstack we've been playing the alpine mostly but i'm sensitive actually no let's play the moscow and this is a line which flies under the radar it causes a lot of people to roll their eyes but it's actually very venomous and take my word for this bishop i've checked this is called the moscow variation okay so now we castle and the moscow variation is sort of like a morozy bind against d6 more rootsy bind of course is mostly played against the accelerator he goes queen takes d7 now yeah we definitely will so what is the perk of what we what we're doing we have not yet put a knight on c3 everybody sees that right uh how can we use that to our advantage why you know why is it a good thing and we haven't put our knight on c3 yet what move will we be able to play so we can play c3 d4 but in the spirit of the marotzi bind we can also play c4 and grab more of the center but first we're going to play d4 thank you river right first we're going to play d4 now we're going to capture with our queen and now we're finally ready to play c4 and clamp down on the center the queen can slide back to d3 protecting both of these and our plan in such a position is going to be very clearly defined we've talked about this scenario many many times what is white's plan here what square do we want to access and how do we access it this is the smithslav idea i've shown you that smith's love game many times so this particular stock idea should be very obvious but do we go 95 immediately do we go knight d5 immediately how do we get a knight there so that it's not captured you guys are pointing to the right square but we have to do something for bingo g5 bishop g5 then we take the knight then we put our knight on d5 that is like the classic plan and we don't have to rush with bishop f6 that's another mistake that people make rushing uh if the knight leaves then he does our job for us right we can just put our knight on e5 so one good thing that we can do to increase the pressure is to put the rook on d1 so that once we take on f6 we we can potentially also win the pawn on d6 okay but let's first attend to what he's doing so he's putting the queen on the c file what i think he wants to do maybe is go bishop e6 so a good idea here would be to do what how do we like basically tell him this queen ain't the boss this queen is not the boss whoa bartholomew with a raid thank you john hey guys you go rook ac1 now we've talked at several points we're doing the speedrun you guys coming a great time thank you guys lost today painful game but trying to recover by doing some speed run and uh really appreciate everybody's support reptilius thank you for the sub okay so now we can complete our plan bishop takes f6 but here's the thing this is what i just said um we don't have to rush with this move um and actually in many ways it's much more painful to the opponent when we twist the knife in without actually playing the move the threat is stronger than its execution so let's improve our position to the maximum first let's see how he defends and then okay so bishop g4 is really good both let's chase the bishop away yeah so that's a typical mistake he thinks that he's one upon he has one upon but what is he not foreseen guess what ladies and gentlemen we put a rook on c1 there was a reason we did that okay now this is where things get a little bit attacked we have a beautiful move here here's the thing if we move our rook up to c2 what's the problem the problem is that he goes queen takes c4 and our rook is undefended which means we cannot move the knight from c3 but what we can do we notice that the queen and the king are on forkable squares programmed to win thank you knight d5 you cannot capture the rook because of the fork tactics like these is why you want to solve consistently uh to see stuff like this how do you see this well it's the fact that the queen and the king are on a forkable square and you have a knight that's those factors should set the metal detector off if it's programmed well now we can move the rook away what is our plan going to be here there's several ways that we can go about twisting the knife in further because i'm feeling pretty pretty aggressive okay so he kind of does our workforce f5 is just a blunder we're just going to take that i mean e4 is not dangerous at all we're just going to move our queen away he has no play and look at our beautiful knight here that knight is supervising the entire board it is dominating everything and he is in no position to be opening the position up he's literally doing our work for us okay what should we do what should we do here should we take on f6 no what should we do where should we move the rook bingo we're threatening oh and now we have a sexy move now we have a move that will be on everyone's tinder bio f6 interception tactic f6 and intercepting oh this guy is going to pay in blood fossils in the juicer what should we do now let's twist in that knife think about think of it this way what weaknesses does this move create let's think logically let's think logically okay it creates a weakness on the g6 square now we can play 97 and win a bunch of material but more elegant would be to play this move trying to get to g6 here's my point guys the knight is so strong but it's actually not even worth giving the night up for an exchange 97 would probably be even the best move objectively but i want to emphasize that it's not all about material outposts are so freaking strong that sometimes we want to keep them even in the face of the possibility winning material if he takes our rook we check made him on g7 fossilize queen f5 is fine yeah but king h7 we have rook takes g5 and because of the pin our rook gets into the attack the game is over well as i explained so if he goes king h7 queen f5 would be equivalent we we have rook takes g by and and if he takes uh well he can't take okay and now we don't need to give a check a lot of people here i know are tempted with the check don't give the check because he he covers up with his bishop instead keep your eyes on the prize we take the pawn the point is not to win upon the point is that the g5 pawn is going to be our access point to his king and we've now ensured that that pawn has no other pawn defenders now it's going to be easier to win it's going to be easier to win takes g5 pin and win thank you one good shirt appreciate the tier one so very thematic attack we're not doing anything crazy we're just involving our pieces and i want to make it clear that many roads lead to athens as peter likes to say many roads many roads lead to rome when you're attacking uh there isn't only one method in many positions sometimes there is going to be plenty of others now finally finally we've set the table we've made all of the necessary improvements let's now actually focus on winning material let's go knight f6 jack okay why do i do this now and not before because now we basically you know we've completely disrobed his king and we can transform our our advantage by just taking a million pawns f f f okay sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry i'm i'm correcting it guys i'm correcting it i got it i'm correcting it i'm correcting it i'm correcting it okay there we go you know it's a funny effect when once i once i say it um okay so if we d5 trades queens and i'm just going to show you guys what happened in the last couple of games couple of moves um people were following in their head i think okay so now we're just going to win by pushing this pawn forward paul's daddy think for the prime and d7 and now rook f5 pinning bishop we're going to take on f6 and promote with d8 queen now guys i do see when people say pro the moment the board is frozen i immediately reset it now this last part of the game we played knight f6 jack winning the exchange of course remember he's pinned and then we simply took his pawn forced the queen trade and won the end king very simple game uh we didn't do anything extraordinary this is the moscow variation and the way that he played it we go d4 now why don't we go c4 immediately who can tell me why it's important to play d4 first what is the drawback of playing super what can black now do to prevent us from expanding in the center well black can play this annoying movie five and and we get this pair of weak squares on devops this is a reasonable structure thank you paul's daddy gifting to alex dora but it's not what i wanted i want i want the merodzia bind and we get it and if you're black here you need to immediately try to chip away at at the uh at white's bind right you can't allow um you cannot allow white to expand fully to develop fully that's exactly what happened in the game you saw the result so what should black do here to chip away at white's bind this is theory by the way this is the only way i think for black to equalize and that's the move b5 if you play the sicilian these moves need to be second nature you need to be able to play these moves relatively automatically and i actually can retain the pod by playing b3 i know some of you guys are thinking of that like what's the issue but first of all black's bishop gets a nice development square and second of all if black trades on c4 this pawn becomes isolated and this pawn can be accessed via the c file so black at least gets some active chances in relation to white's pawns on c4 and e4 you see what i'm saying well no queen takes would not be very good because that would walk into like something like d5 and white does want to keep the blind so i would still do this but the position would be double edged now again i cannot emphasize this game enough guys i've shown you many many times smithslav against rutakovsky this game is shown to russian school children when they're still in their mother's womb and there's a very good reason for that because this is one of the most typical positional plans known to man and it never gets old because of how important it is how ubiquitous and transferable it is to so many different types of positions um this is literally i mean i've known this game for i don't know how long um and and i've shown it to all my students i've shown it many many times and as as stale as it is there's a reason why it's still this is this game's miss gloverdakovsky1945 what did white do in this position somebody remind me white does not go knight t5 right white goes bishop g5 takes the knight and puts a knight on d5 this is the typical method of establishing a knight in the outpost this has been done to me many many times even in my own chess career i have i have been the recipient i have been on the receiving end of this plan so transferring this back to the speed run we literally do the exact same thing bishop g5 but there's one difference we don't need to rush with bishop takes f6 right uh the knight's not going anywhere it is literally pinned so we first make an improvement to the position by x-raying his queen and only after he plays h6 wasting time sorry one second so rook ft1 bringing our other rook into the game bishop g4 now basically here uh there were a couple of tactical moments we could have gotten knight d5 but instead i decided to get his bishop to move he takes on f3 thinking ah i won the pawn but that's why we put the rook on c1 we go knight t5 that's actually similar to what smithslav did it's more frozen no it's not and the fact of the matter is if he takes on a2 we trans we transfer the attack right we now give up our knight but we're simply gonna checkmate him very easily that's another thing i want people to notice uh people tend to be to fall in love with their pieces when we have a nine and an outpost that night can be used as a bargaining chip right you can use that night and give it away for the greater good you just because it's a beautiful night doesn't mean you want to keep it there forever there are things that will that will require you to give this knight away that's fundamentally why you put it put it there chess is a game or you have to learn how to transform your advantages and now knight d5 was the key mode knight t5 is a small tactic if bishop takes c1 we win the queen right and now we get space for our rook to move in the pawn is no longer decked in f5 was just panic um doesn't the queen take the c2 yeah but why does a fork on c7 so what is an outpost i i think there's formal definitions but i like to think of it informally an outpost is a square now i would say statistically mostly occupied by knight but an outpost can be for any piece even upon um and usually it's in the enemy territory so think of this part of the board an outpost is a square in this territory where a piece is supported by your pawns and to my eye the main defining factor of an outpost the piece has to be unassailable which is to say no opposing pawn can chase away that piece all right no opposing pawn can chase away that piece so if you were to reposition black's pawn to e7 you were to reposition it from e5 to e7 this would no longer be considered an outpost because black would play e6 and chase away the knight that is what i would call the defining factor here that's why the knight is so good in russia they call it the eternal knight now he panics and gives away the pawn and loses quickly what would have been our plan had he not done that well what i would propose is to double on the g file and then dislodge the bishop with g4 when the attack on the g7 pawn would have been completely unstoppable okay um outpost target a large area well yeah can you have a bad outpost yes you can have a vehicle coin uh coin you can have a bad outpost um not all outposts are good but i think the connotation of an outpost is that it is good right um you could invent a bad outpost but if you're talking about outpost that usually means you're proud of that piece yes so i would consider it an outpost even if the bishop could have sailed the night um that's still an outpost i would say that it's the limit test is whether a pawn can chase away the outpost well no black is basically busting here because because of the night i've lost many games like this i have been in many situations like this with the black pieces and it's not fun gotta kamsky once beat me precisely in a position like this crushed me on the king's side on the g file actually in a game that was eerily reminiscent of how we beat this guy the problem is when you get a knight like that on d5 no matter who you are whether you're a gm or you know what you're rating is you lose without a fight because it's so hard to manufacture to manufacture uh chances so if you take a look at the following position yeah so this is from my game against gotta camp scheme you guys can see the similarities are eerie knight on d5 outpost and um he crushes me here because black has absolutely no play i'm just going to run through the game gotta runs his pawn up to v6 and what he basically does is uh he gives up that knight you see what i said earlier in precisely the way that i described he gives it up in order to ruin my king side pawn structure and the advantage transforms from a positional one to a tactical one the knight has given itself up to open the g file and now you know fittingly the game ends when he gets his rook to the g file unstoppable right so this is exactly what i mean when i say transform the advantage uh there's more to talk about and unpack here but i want to move on let's get the next camera rolling what is it about outposts that make them so strong yeah it's mostly about the cramping and also they control don't overthink it like we're just controlling a million squares like the knight in the center controls eight squares mathematically but it exerts its pressure over essentially all parts of the board okay so let's move on next game hope you guys are enjoying um the games have become more complicated but my hope is that you know trying to make this understandable still even to beginners you
