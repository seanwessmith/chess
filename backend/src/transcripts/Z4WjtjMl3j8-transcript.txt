let's go we are playing with the black pieces here let's um appreciate it guys now i've been playing the kings indian almost exclusively but uh in this game i want to play something a little bit different i want to play something a little bit more solid and i want to show you guys how to play um how to play more solidly let's play the slav let's play the slav knight c6 the slob is a form of the queen's gamma declined where you don't take the pawn instead you protect it with the c pawn and now we accept it with d64 this is one variation of the slop john marthamu likes this line now what is the idea essentially the way to understand it is this white goes a4 to stop b5 so white's going to play e3 and he's going to recapture the pawn we shouldn't try to cling to that pawn rather than trying to cling to that pawn what we should do is develop our pieces in as free and coordinated fashion as possible which means let's get the bishop outside the pawn chain remember don't go e6 here that bishop remains inside the pawn chain let's get it outside the pawn chain and if we're keenly aware of what white does where does this bishop belong noticing by the way which weaknesses white has created with his last move where does this bishop belong bingo and this is theory bishop before exploiting the weakness created by f4 no rocket science here we're making natural developing moves and now we need to develop this knight d7 being the only available square but i like this right it's connecting to the other knight this is still theory now the main line here is queen e2 to prepare e4 let's see if he knows it there's many many moves here queen v3 also possible i actually know this line fairly well use h3 which is a little bit of an empty move uh no need for us to modify our strategy we can complete our development by castling and he goes 94 that was his idea he is going to end up taking this bishop but that's not a problem because he's wasted a bunch of moves on the taking of this bishop now here's an important question should we leave the bishop on f5 or should we drop the bishop to g6 there is a very important logical chain that we need to apply here we actually should leave the bishop on f5 why you guys might say wait a second what what are you saying i can see why you lost to el shawn i'm talking about nonsense he's going to take on f5 he's going to ruin your pawn structure but give this a little bit more thought um give this a little bit more thought let's go knight v6 expanding a little bit once he takes on f5 and we take back our pawn on f5 is going to clamp down on his center it's going to control the e4 square and we're going to create this very nice pawn mass on the king side where each pawn defends its neighbor we're going to go g6 and the f5 pawn is going to be defended so essentially it's another form of clamping down at the cost of yes slightly ruining our pawn structure but ever so slightly just one pair of double pawns never really hurt anybody and that is an inconsistent move because he's actually letting us trade bishops and his night gets misplaced so he's wasting a lot of time here doing a whole lot of nothing now we should continue making marginal improvements to our position the reason that the slav is not to everyone's liking is that even if white plays in mediocre fashion black is not going to have an immediate blow now what is white threatening here what i don't want to allow is the move a5 i don't want to let white pushes pawns a6 and introduce defects in our queen sets what should we do yeah we should play a5 because not only does it stop a5 it cements the bishop on kind of an outpost it's not really in the center but it's a good square now let's think about what what do we want to do here what and a lot of people struggle in a position like this but um there's no need to struggle because the default approach in a situation like this is to continue making marginal improvements to your position and one move that i really like one move that i really like here the fact is the queen is undefended we can see here malcolm i actually love your move c5 the bishop is on an outpost i know this move looks a little awkward but remember his bishop is locked behind the pawn chain so our pieces in a sense are more active than his which means that opening up the position even a little bit should be in our favor uh and we're not doing anything dry yeah okay so he put a knight on up was not a big deal now we're going to bring a rook into the game with rook c8 why are we putting it on a closed file because i am assuming that eventually we're probably going to take on d4 and the file is going to open up okay so hopefully everything i'm doing is making sense now which piece can we improve further what should we do here if we look at the queen does the queen have a nice place somewhere toward the center it actually does yeah we can go c4 here that would be interesting we can go knight d5 yeah so we can go queen d5 we can go 95 let's go queen d5 potentially preparing rook f2d8 we are increasing our pressure on the center our opponent is playing very well he's not doing anything terribly wrong but i feel like he's starting to slip and in openings such as the slob you make these marginal improvements we take toward the center right we take toward the center we don't stick with the c pawn because we want to maintain pressure on the d4 pawn speaking of maintaining pressure on the d4 pawn what should we do now well one thing that we can take a second to do is to take care of our back rank yeah let's go rook fda first but at some point it might be a good idea to play g6 uh and ensure that our back rank is is not weak because he has already played h3 i don't want to give him that unfair advantage okay so a5 how do i think of a move like this a lot of people here would just want to move tonight but wait a minute what do you what do i notice about this move what i notice about this move is that it leaves the b5 knight undefended if only we can exploit that and we combine that with the observation that that queen on d3 is vulnerable we can go c4 into intermediate move exposing the attack on the knight that's why we put the queen on d5 and if he takes our knight from b6 evades capture and takes d4 intercepting white's queen's control of the knight he's his knight is going to be in big trouble here he needs to respond very carefully to avoid losing a piece he needs to be very careful to avoid losing he does have a way to do that let's see if he finds it he's still going to be in quite a bit of trouble if he does that but um let's see yeah this is a a pretty sexy move uh the album is pretty decent actually doesn't get enough love i think it's a pretty good opening for certain players okay so he hasn't found the best move and now we can take the knight he takes r knight and here it's very important to be patient don't just grab the pawn try to find the best intermediate move first how can we malcolm tucker is absolutely right of course this is kind of a no-brainer we could have also taken the pawn but then we would have had triple pawns on the people now we can take p6 we are up upon and we're basically winning here now we just need to show good technique let's not forget to take care of our back rank particularly since he's going to double i don't want to have to deal with this crap at some point in the future what's going to be our plan here well what i'm annoyed by is this rook so what we're going to do here and first of all this knight and this knight wants to swing to d3 that's a very good move actually very good move so let's get our queen somewhere civilized and how should we defend the spawn we have to move knight to d5 if he goes e4 he weakens the d4 square that's going to be fatal for him and um what he should do is go rook halfway one that requires a lot of maturity though that requires a lot of maturity let's see if he doesn't i'm a little bit low on time so if he goes through cafe one uh this is actually not quite as easy to win as i had initially anticipated he's done a very good job defending this so far but um maturity not in like the behavioral sense although that too and he does it i'm going to go rook c7 in order to protect the seventh rank i anticipate okay so should we trade rooks should we trade rooks absolutely we should you guys are making the same mistake that i described right it's not like a test question where you're like okay this guy this stupid guy thinks this is he rights and the answer is always no i'm asking you not from that perspective let's go b5 to chase the rook away and now what is our plan going to be here i want somebody to describe the plan to me and to tell me how to accomplish this plan quickly our plan should be simplified which means to trade off the second pair of rooks and we should do that in the interest of time i'm going to start moving by going queen b6 and now we're going to go rook a7 why are we trading the other pair of rooks because once the rooks are gone from the board it's going to be a lot easier for us to exploit that past pawn and now we're going to do that by trying to dislodge the queen from uh c2 we're gonna go queen to b2 and instead of going c2 we're gonna first take on f2 i'll delve into the reasons behind this after the game given that i'm a little low on time i do want to play a little bit faster here and i will worry not i will explain everything after the game basically i'm i'm eliminating uh issues so now we can go 94 and if he takes the knight that's actually kind of a sexy move uh we go c2 and the knight cannot stop the pawn and he resigns good game okay uh that was a very that was a very good game i mean he he did not fold over easily and this is the reason why the slav is an acquired taste because as you guys could see even if white was playing kind of in meteor profession we were very solid but it's hard for black to win the game in one fell swoop very hard for black to win like the game immediately if you know what i'm saying okay okay so the slot so basically dc the other move in this position is to play e6 by the way this is called the semi-slav and this creates like the pawn triangle i think it's also called the triangle system and um the drawback of this is that it it blocks in the bishop on c8 but this leads to some very very complex lines like d takes c4 is simpler and if white goes e4 then black goes b5 it's the it's hard to recover the pawn that's why a4 is played in these positions um so bishop f5 e3 e6 bishop takes c4 now bishop b4 i explained these moves right we developed the bishop to the square that has been weakened by his move a4 knight bd7 h3 we castle knight h4 and now knight b6 so bishop d3 was poor he should have gone bishop b3 and stuck to his plan so just to recap um the fact of the matter is what are the drawbacks of this move there are two the first is we obviously double our pawns and second of all we do you know his bishop gets a little bit more active but on the flip side our pawn exerts tremendous control over the e4 square and in combination with the knight on t5 we could potentially really clamp down on him by putting our knights on these two squares i hope that makes sense and also we can defend the pawn by playing g6 that's going to be generally speaking black's main play does that make sense i know that's not bad so he goes bishop d3 um no i don't think you should trade bishops now we go a5 to samantha bishop uh spicy brings his knight back and now c5 opening up the center why do we open it up because our pieces are more active than our opponent's pieces okay knight b5 rook c8 so basically okay bishop d2 a lot of people here would trade the bishop uh and you know that's a that's an instinct that people just have to remove right because it's not a good idea to trade the bishop that's on an outpost for a bishop that's on d2 that's like voluntarily you know getting your dental filling removed like that bishop on before an outpost also functions to uphold the weaknesses behind it right in a certain sense you can think of it as you know it's like the taybridge collapse you know one of my favorite gruesome will not favor that's the wrong word um a very gruesome historical event the collapse of the tay bridge it's a very interesting story in scotland in the 1870s um there was an architect i think his name was thomas buff and a scottish i think this was edible or glasgow i don't remember one of the scottish cities they wanted to build a bridge the tay bridge they wanted it to be good so they come to dr buff and let me let me actually get the name straight one sec i think it's like bowser or something dundee dundee scotland so let me get the name straight because i hate making stuff up so basically yeah so sir thomas bausch so they they come to sir thomas belch and they commissioned him to to build the bridge um that carries trains across the firth of tay between the city of dundee in a suburb they wanted it to be good and he works on it and they build the bridge and then on um 28th of december 1879 there's a fierce storm that happens in dundee very fierce storm huge wind but the trains still run and tragically because this guy slacked off and this guy didn't do his homework uh there were certain architectural defects that he knew about and the bridge collapsed while it had a train on it literally like the top half of the bridge collapsed and the train went right into the water and uh this was a pretty famous historical event let's just say that guy did not have a good time and there's a famous photograph that was taken after the collapse um it was a very famous photo that was taken after the collapse of the tay bridge which looks like this you can see that just like half of it is gone and that's where the train collapses the water this is like 1870s um and uh yeah the people unfortunately perished so not to use that as a tool to explain the speed run but to use that as a tool to explain the speed run think of the bishop on before as the tay bridge if you take on d2 and outposts in general are like a bridge outposts protect weaknesses that are left behind the outpost and if you give up the bishop these pawns on a5 and c5 which looked really good are now incredibly weak okay sorry that's a pretty out there analogy but i really want to make this important point you shouldn't have the default to like take a piece when it's when a trade is offered okay so a new bridge was built and that bridge did not go live so queen d5 bishop takes before a takes before capturing toward the center keeping the pawn on c5 to pressure d4 thank you rook f28 improving the rook and now a5 was the big mistake this was the decisive mistake because it leaves the knight unprotected and he misses the tactic what should white have done here probably just improved his own position with rookies but i think white is fine here it's a it's a game maybe black is a little bit a little bit better but after a5 c4 the knight gets caught on the crossfire the move queen e2 would have been superior to queen d2 uh the reason why is that here we do not have the move c3 in fact the queen is pinned so at least white preserves relative material balance um black is still better though so queen d2 queen v5 now c3 we win the pawn and we get a huge protected passer now spicy played well here but ultimately we trade rooks because we're up a pun and we have a passer when we have a pass pawn like this we want to get the game into the end game and now the key idea b5 why we want to get the rook to a7 why we want to trade rooks why do we want to trade rooks as i just explained we want to simplify because past spawns are most important in the end game that's exactly what we do now we get the queen to b2 dislodging the queen from c2 and now why didn't we play c2 could somebody explain to me why this doesn't just promote the pawn it actually does but um this leads to unnecessary complications this is a good this is an important point so it's not knight d3 because then we just win the night it's actually check and notice that black's queen is all of a sudden out of the game that's like timor gorillaps going from my game and all of a sudden it's very i don't think it's possible to avoid perpetual in fact in many cases if you watch end games you can actually allow black to promote and i actually think white might almost be winning here white has this huge attack and black actually has no checks despite the fact that he's got two queens so be careful about assuming that the game is over when you promoted a second queen be very careful about that sometimes even with two queens the king is relatively insulated against this and black is actually losing here i've confirmed it with a computer so you know be careful about that that's why we take on f2 so that this queen could bring itself back to f6 take care of the king first and now we can with a single mind ah spicy with 800 bits and we simply promote 94 by the way nice little detail of c2 then he goes knight t3 stopping the plot so knight e4 derails his knight from c5 get it uh and if he had taken the knight we go c2 and we win the game okay moving right along 200 bits thank you moriyam gm we're playing a gm okay now let's play the modern uh i've played this i think once before i want to showcase how to play hyper modern openings now this is the sort of cousin of the perk it often transposes into the perk and he plays bishop c4 okay so uh in this position we of course want to develop the knights uh yeah what is wrong with this move ladies and gentlemen and maybe i should have done this against celshan trusted myself correct you know practice what i preach thank you ladies and gentlemen for the free pawn no reason not to take it he just uh auto-piloted it don't autopilot when your opponent plays unusual openings now very important to react accurately here how should we react what are the possibilities here there are several good ways we can play d5 to cement the knight on the e4 square and i actually quite like this move okay we can build up a little pawn chain or we can cover with the bishop but let's build up the pawn chain now what should we do here what would be in the spirit well actually okay so here's where a lot of people would slip up a lot of people would be tempted i think to play bishop f5 but the problem with bishop f5 i called it is why does this very nasty move knight to h4 okay and um that knight attacks the bishop and the entire construction threatens to topple over so let's invite harry nelson pillsbury and let's let mr pillsbury do some talking this is the pillsbury knight remember what i always say pawns are the best defender of a piece when a pawn defends a piece that piece is very stable why can try to go f3 in the future but guess what white's already castled so a move like f3 might end up in disaster do we take the knight do we have to do anything here at all just castle just develop same spirit okay now we have a very good move what am i saying here i'm seeing the knight this is a type two undefended piece uh which means that it's only protected by one piece so what my brain immediately notices here is the fact that the queen x-rays the knight through the lens of the pawn let's move that pawn out simultaneously occupying the center that's the great thing about the pill oh thank you for the night okay this guy is really not having his best day he blunders the knight but already white was basically lost and that is the game okay well that was a quickie it won't take us long to analyze so queen e2 here by the way is is the main move um as far as i know you you do need to defend the pawn uh that is not a bad idea but uh our opponent yielded yield to that part now the only really important moment here was this position i'm sure bishop f5 was fine but uh i was a little bit scared of the move knight h4 guys what's the problem here with black why is this even an issue well the problem is let's say we castle right he plays knight takes f5 yeah and we have to get this very nasty pawn structure you might argue well isn't this a pillsbury knight well it is but now we've given him like this h5 square for his queen no need to to ruin our pawn structure like that so knight h4 is not a big issue um but f5 is a more stable way to defend the knight in my opinion so knight g5 we simply castle obviously we don't take the knight that would defeat the whole purpose of putting it on e4 in fact that would be very bad for black and if he goes f3 uh we actually just take on d4 with devastating consequences to the king the funny thing is if the king goes to f1 do we actually have to move the knight here what would what would be black's best move in other words borrowing from the game what you guys should see here is the fact that the rook is x-raying the king which means that the funny thing is he actually is not threatening the night we can still go e5 as if nothing was going on because if he takes he's literally going to get checkmated in the center of the board that's literally what's going to happen so this is a disaster he played c3 and now e5 is a simple tactic extending the attack on the knight if he takes we take with the f-pawn to open the f-file we have a brilliant pawn mass and we're up upon horrible position for roy but he at least should have done this after bishop takes c4 we of course also take with the f pawn we don't take with a d-pawn cause that would also open up this diagonal the h6 would be the same idea in spirit but it wouldn't carry the the benefit of opening up the center and that's what's important about that move is that does that make sense guys okay so let me see here okay any questions how about d5 instead of d6 what if he tries to cement his knight on e5 it's a pretty weak square well if he tries to cement his knight on e5 we can we can assail it with knight d7 right we have plenty of pieces that are guarding that square that's a great point and we have to factor that when you play a move like f5 you absolutely have to factor in the fact that you're weakening e5 right and um that's just something you have to notice but we notice it because we have plenty of pieces that are defending that square so type one undefended piece right type one undefended piece is a piece that is not defended by any other pieces or pawns a defended piece is a piece that is defended by either a pawn or more than one pieces okay we call that he's defended bishop on f4 would be a type one undefended piece nothing is defending it clear type two undefended piece a piece that is only protected by exactly one other piece and not a pawn right so for example here um i'm looking bishop on g7 is type one could you name a black piece that is a type two undefended piece i love el shawn he's great he's a very very nice guy and very classy and you know rook on h8 yes now here's the thing guys not every night on v8 this idea loses its meaning if you indiscriminately kind of point to every piece and think ah this piece is important you have to exercise your judgment in terms of identifying the type two undefended pieces that might be vulnerable like the knight on v8 is not vulnerable well it could be but i would say the rook on eight shade is less vulnerable than the knight of the bishop right uh the knight is made contact with the by the bishop so by definition or at least using our judgment we can conclude that there it's more likely that there's going to be some sort of a tactic with the knight then with the rook um well orpheus well that's that's where it gets into the tricky bit right if you're aware of the fact that you're making an undefended piece that's already part of the process toward not blundering awareness is very important in chess right blunders often happen because precisely because we are unaware that a certain piece is vulnerable so awareness will not always produce total lack of blunders nobody can eliminate blunders but it's important let's move on
