if you are somebody who tries to to teach yourself and and you want to maximize your improvement you have to try things out if you're unsure about a certain way of playing right about where when you weaken your king or when you make certain types of moves just try it out right you have to do a lot of experimentation if you read the biographies of some of the greatest self-learners in history people like thomas edison and people who didn't have access to you know instruction in great quantities uh what i think unifies them is the fact that they had the guts to experiment uh and and fail many many many times and derive the lessons from their losses and their failures so that is my very firm opinion on on how you should approach this process of understanding and finding your balance and finding your style [Music] and i know that this is all very general and uh it's all well and good but i just wanted to make that clear as we come now come back the server is back online so we can continue playing is everybody ready to continue let's get that energy going we have been playing the sicilian for the last couple of games by popular demand and we will continue to do so okay so we faced this line a couple of times already what is the main flaw of playing bishop c4 against the sicilian it's the fact that we can play e6 at any moment uh and blunt the bishop entirely now we don't have to play e6 immediately we can develop our knight first uh and i would say that it's better to develop this knight over the other one because if we develop the other one first we might allow a little nasty move e5 so let's actually develop knight f6 we again we don't have to hurry oh and f3 perfect so now we play e6 and not only are we blunting the bishop but when we play d5 we're killing two birds with one stone we're opening up the center which is particularly good now that he's played this move f3 okay um how should we continue our development and uh this speaks to the theme that i just talked about which is that not every development move uh it has to be an eat option of a vesuvius you can just play normal development moves sometimes and they don't have to be the most active moves right and uh the move that i'm referring to here is either bishop e7 but let's play bishop d7 i don't want him to take on c6 and ruin my pawn structure so i'm going to recapture with the bishop does that make sense we could have tried d4 setting a trap because if he well anyways i'll talk about that later um so i'm going to note this now this is a very important moment six bishop d7 okay now once again uh we can make a very standard development move and it isn't the most active one but it's a pretty effective one thank you dukeduk94 so what do we do how do we get out of this pin how do we absolve ourselves of this pen here's two good moves please reserve your questions for after the game one is bishop b7 but there is a slightly spicier move that we can play we can actually move the queen where can we move the queen i don't particularly like queen a5 because it's too you know it's like you're putting your head down and barreling against the wall let's play queen b6 what is the purpose of this move first of all we're attacking the pawn ring second of all i am already eyeing this diagonal why am i eyeing this diagonal because he's played f3 and by playing f3 he has weakened this diagonal so and perfect so we can now play a move to make things explode and this move is a direct consequence of the fact that he played f3 and he weakened this diagonal this is a very standard kind of breakthrough it looks it may look mysterious but uh it's just a very direct conclusion uh of what he's done it's it's a punishment if you will c4 now we open up this diagonal but that's not the only thing we open up he's probably going to take on c4 to which we're going to respond how what are we oh rook b1 is just too slow uh we can actually win material how can we win material think about all of the benefits of the move c4 what have we opened up right bishop before is correct attacking this knife this knight lacks a defender that is a pawn and he can protect it with his other knight but we can simply reinforce the pressure on the knight with what move we got d4 well okay he gives us the knight immediately with check now he's got to move the king it's a total disaster let's recapture the pawn and now let's chart of course toward finishing the game this king is on e2 that should immediately call to mind uh the idea of what what should be the total what should be the idea and what is the best way to accomplish this idea long castle is correct very good and everybody sees it we don't recon there's okay rookie 8 i don't even ask people because that's clear that you guys understand the idea here now after the king moves we want to open up as many files as possible so we're then going to play d take c4 but the point is not to like restore equality of pawns the point is just to open up as many files as possible and diagonals and speaking of diagonals there is a diagonal that we can open and we can put a bishop on that diagonal and basically checkmate him so if we assume the queen moves to c1 which is the only possible square i'm anticipating that he's either well though okay so what do we do now what do we do now okay now we just take the queen and uh the rest is very simple let's just infiltrate with our queen potentially to e2 and well i just got to make sure people are paying attention and the game is over very simple direct and the rest is just going to be history so he was already very much lost but if he had moved to screen perhaps we would have been able to demonstrate an instructive move he's disconnected okay so i think he might have you know might have gone his own way here okay and he disconnects so we're over 1250 let's play one more game here or actually two more and we are black against as as the zero let's see let's go another sicilian and he goes knight c3 as well thank you uh j root for another 500 bits now knight f3 we can go g6 essentially preparing for the accelerated and he goes d3 that's not a mistake but it's not a very good move because he blunts his bishop and the only way to make d3 really work would be g3 transposing into a king's indian attack but probably he's gonna go bishop e2 because i just have a feeling yep uh and well that's just very passive i mean there's there's very very passive uh and he keeps the center closed which is fine uh but we've got very harmonious development we've got a nicely fiance bishop that's sort of controlling and skewering the whole diagonal and uh he goes knight d5 so do we take the knight do we take the knight yeah speedrun that is actually a slow run uh yes we do we absolutely do because we ruin this pawn structure and then where do we put this knight yeah knight p4 exactly so we attacked the pawn on d5 and in fact it's a double attack we went upon and we just dropped the bishop back to g7 that's another thing that okay so here we have a really cute move if people want a five head move try to find the best square for the night and really think deeply about where the knight actually can go think about all of the weak squares in white's position yeah you guys are actually seeing it it's the move knight a2 which looks incredibly scary like isn't the knight gonna get trapped well it's not because he cannot stop our knight from getting to c3 okay and he's not attempted to he just blundered his rook in response that's actually one of the positive byproducts of a move like knight a2 is it it it shocks the opponent uh and and oftentimes a blunder like this happens as a consequence uh that's actually in its option and he resigns uh very good okay so we're playing grand 25 and we have been playing the italian but let's for some variety play the rye lopez let's play the red lopez he's played the bird and the bird is one of those openings that that makes a lot of people scared but the reality is we should just play naturally right first we should take the knight and what is the most natural move uh in this position just the most natural no you're not reinventing the wheel not doing anything crazy or just castling right even the move d3 right so so he goes c6 now where should we put this bishop what would be the most um active i would say square for this bishop given that we're retreating that would obviously be c4 yeah he goes b5 big whoa right we don't care uh pawns alone are not going to win the game and this is actually already a very big mistake if we look very carefully he forgot to make one very important move which is the move d6 and he's allowed us to push up our own pawn attack his knight he's going knight d5 but that is just asking for it for what reason i mean i'm not big on pawn structure but you know that's not to say pawn structure isn't important we just take the knight i mean queen f3 is not even necessary look at his pawns he's got triple puns uh but let's again not forget about development let's not forget about the eye response uh let's not forget about the fact that we have to develop our queen side and we have to do it quickly we have a very fine okay we want to use twitch terminology we have a very five head way of developing this bishop on c1 think about what we want to accomplish right the weakest of these three pawns is the d4 pawn can we use the bishop to attack that pawn can we use the bishop to attack that pawn like do we have to develop this bishop to f4 or can we find a more creative way to develop it yes we can there's something called the fianchetto okay uh he has started to move his bishop back and forth all right that's great uh we fianchetto we win the pawn that was weird did i just hallucinate did he just go bishop b7 bishop see he's having an attemptron right now i think he's having any toughness yeah i know i'm making one easy blah blah blah and now where should we put this knight well we only have one square which is c3 that is a fork we're going to take d5 and we're going to win the game okay there should be some now i'm going to say something radical right now we don't actually even need to take this one right we don't need to take this point why the hell not like what what is it that we can do that is that is better than taking a free pawn what do you guys think e6 i don't want to open the position up e6 would be a very instructive mistake actually uh but the move queen g4 i really like because it accumulates the attacking chances on the queen on the king's side it accumulates attacking chances on the king side now the queen of the bishop alone are not going to deliver the checkmate e6 would be very very tempting i know but then black can go f6 and he can essentially blunt the influence of the bishop so what we're going to do is play f4 we are preparing exactly two things first is a rook lift which i really like the second is just a pawn push all the way to f6 and then we're going to deliver lobster pins are made on g7 both of these ideas are competing for our attention and they're both very strong the fastest is just to try to ram this pawn up to f6 okay to his credit he's defending well but let's bring another piece into the game let's bring the rook into the game and what i want to emphasize in positions like this is is that we're not actually in a hurry there's no need to go crazy there's no need to go for checkmate within three four moves because uh not only are we better tactically we are attacking but we are also better positionally we are dominating him in terms of blockading the d4 square let's open up the position and we have after bishop takes f6 another very five head move we have a move that crushes instantly and it's a very very nice move and how do i find this move well i see that the bishop on f6 is immobilized it cannot move back so we play rook to e7 bishop cannot capture the rook because of checkmate right and that's how i saw this move i saw that the bishop was immobilized if he takes on d4 and we take with a queen repositioning it but we're still threatening checkmate he has to go rook f7 and after he goes rook f7 okay goes for cuff 6. my first inclination well i have several inclinations uh we can resort back to an idea that we had earlier what is that idea that we had earlier which may allow us to increase our attacking um potency oh yeah we can just play knight 65 actually that's a that's actually even better uh and that's not just a pawn that's also a fork against his uh kang and his rook and i guess he could play king fade and try to counter attack our rook and uh what would be the simplest win here and this is where we talk about transforming the advantage right most people would be inclined to take on d7 but whenever there are two pieces hanging you want to check what happens if you take one of the pieces queen takes eight eight if you calculate with me king takes e7 we're going to play this move we can give a check on e1 and the king has to emerge out of its shell because if he goes king f7 and i think that's what he might actually do uh he allows no he plays correctly but now we take on a6 we hunt him down and again we transform the advantage if he offers us a queen troop king king c5 let's continue the king hunt what should we do how do we continue the king hunt can we give a check that further brings his king out of the shell let's go b4 check okay and this is not rocket science we could have also considered d4 check uh and king hunting is hard uh but it's not like i know something that you don't i'm just trying to find the right way to funnel the king in the right direction if you will now i'm gonna go c4 uh threatening queen d5 checkmate uh and if he gives us a check on a7 we can counter with check of our okay queen e5 this checkmate um i went quickly through that segment uh just because there's no no there's no rocket science there i'm just sort of bringing attackers in that was a nice game uh and and this game really illustrates the concepts of transforming the advantage and purposeful development all in sort of one package one more game then we analyze then we wrap up for today it's already been six hours actually so i'm getting really really tired but one more game i've got in me and this time he goes b6 we've already faced g6 uh this time we're facing b6 oh no board okay sorry sorry sorry our conception from the last time somebody played g6 against us what move did we discuss at length in that game and that was the move h4 so let's play h4 let's see what he does and i guarantee you that this is going to win us the game he allows us to ram our pawn all the way up to h5 which is actually quite devastating quite quite devastating and what are we threatening uh once again let us review by playing h5 well there is one thing we can do that i indicated earlier which just uh h6 right exactly we just push harry down the board the bishop has a very unenviable choice of retreat squares you can go to f8 or we can go to f6 and both of these moves are just incredibly ugly they both have their drawbacks once again he has combined the two forbidden moves e6 and g6 and by just simply developing eventually we're going to control all of these dark squares and that is going to be the instrument of our domination now here i'm going to actually on poisson i want to keep the center a little bit open uh now you guys might be very surprised by this move right why are you giving up that e pawn which was controlling f6 and part of the reason that i'm doing it is because the h6 pawn is already controlling enough dark squares we don't need another pawn controlling the dark squares around blind skiing we have one and that's enough but let's continue expanding in the center let's continue ramming pawns up his throat uh and creating weaknesses in his position what move am i talking about here indirectly i'm talking about the move d5 advancing the pawn opening up the center blah blah he's probably going to go e5 but when he goes e5 we re we reassess the situation we ask ourselves okay which new weak squares have been created as a consequence and the square that i'm really that catches my eye is this square on c6 can we try to get a piece there can we try to get a piece to the c6 square and we re we can i mean it's a pretty simple idea we can try let's give a check on b5 let's see what he does all right there we go we got a we got a bishop to c6 okay he's taken which is just basically harakiri because by taking on c6 and this is something a lot of beginners fail to do uh is is i understand the sort of positional ramifications of a trade right and he's going to well he i was going to say he's going to win the policy six but he's actually not going to win the pawn on c6 because we are going to defend it how are we going to defend it with the queen okay queen c7 and now it is time to look at tactics how do we know to look for tactics here well we've got a lead in development he's got tons of weaknesses we've talked about these situations before uh this is just calling for tactics knight b5 is going to be the move uh because once he takes we're going to go knight c7 check we could have taken the queen first and then played knight c7 but i want to keep the queens on the board this guy is actually very good uh he's playing a lot better than his rating uh so kudos to him we're just gonna keep developing now we are going to extricate our queen from uh a8 we're going to slam it on d5 where it is sitting on a very nice outpost he goes queen c6 now we can trade queens that's fine but let's trade queens on our terms what do i mean by that let's trade queens on our terms what move keeps the tension while also developing and while also uh applying pressure on one of his weaknesses that would be long castle exactly all right now training is boring but sometimes it's necessary and if he trades queens you know be my guest he allows our rook then to occupy this outpost pawn on d6 is hanging and now it's clear that our plan should revolve around attacking that pawn on d6 how do we go about attacking that pawn on d6 what pieces do we use it's clear that we'll need to use our knight where should we put our knight in order to exert pressure on d6 knight d2 is correct i see a lot of people indicating this thank you nickelodeon for the thousand bits this is a maneuver that people may see and think what is it that's a classic gm move it's not really a gm move it's very simple you're just identifying the biggest weakness and thinking about how you can attack it more purposefully and uh minor pieces are very good at that okay he just leaves that pawn hanging so we're just gonna take it okay great i mean he trades and lets us activate our king that's perfect and don't forget about this pawn on h6 mark my words that pawn is going to be precisely the reason why we win the game other than the fact that we're up in exchange okay so what remains in this position well we need to activate all of our pieces which means the stroke on h1 needs to be activated as efficiently as possible and there is a perfect way of doing that there's several can somebody give me an elegant way of activating the stroke we can actually rook yeah we can do a rook lifts uh don't think of rook lifts as only things that happen in attacking middle games we can lift a rook up in order to activate it i mean nobody forbade us to do that yep there we go rook c7 and um we have a and what did i tell you guys i told you mark my words we're going to use the h6 bond to win the game and i didn't know how we're going to do that it did i didn't know if it would be checkmate and the time has come to use the h6 pawn to win the game we can take on g6 and if he takes our pawn actually promotes which is kind of ironic we thought we might use the pawn to give checkmate but we actually use this pawn to make a new queen out of it and that's why long-term weaknesses like a pawn on h6 are so hard to deal with because they're they're there forever uh and and they can transform themselves into so many different other advantages all right so we're going to win this game the rest is very simple we just use the queen to pick off as many pawns as possible and then we promote the resulting passers okay let's create a pass pawn we already know from many uh many of these cases that the basic winning formula in such positions is to create a passpond as efficiently as possible and then to push it all the way to promotion okay he's giving up the knight the rest is easy we're just gonna push the spot up through to ga we're going to make a second queen and we're going to use the two queens to ladder checkmate okay i mean i'm not actually a specialist in finding the fastest mate oh yeah this is me okay um that was a nice game uh and and he played very very well now this 13 move game the only thing to point out is that uh the accelerated dragon also offers a very good setup for people uh to play against almost any uh of these setups that white may have right you don't really need to change the way that you play with black now this move knight a2 is one that i wanted to explain why is the knight not getting trapped because we have the c3 square and that is where the bishop comes into play the bishop controls that square and white has no way of controlling it twice right um so that was a very simple game and he flutters his rook and that's not the only time that the move knight a2 won a game for me on the 12th move i actually had a game many years ago where the move knight a2 won me the game in 13 moves oh my god that's a pretty eerie coincidence so this game took 13 moves now look at this game that i played many years ago over the board richard newey against me in 2007 i was 2100 very similar opening he played this bishop e2 he does this weird stuff with b4 he opens up the diagonal and now look at this knight on b4 i don't just drop it back to c6 tamely where do i put my knife boom knight a2 and he resigned because this knight essentially is the instrument of the knight on c3's demise yeah so i was actually 11 when this game was played yeah but um yeah so 13 moves and the move knight a2 was featured in it that's a pretty interesting set in this other in this next game he played the bird variation of the rye lopez forgot to play d6 so we play e5 we shatter his pawn structure use the dark squared bishop to pick off the pawn and then slowly accumulate the pressure this move rookie 7 is where the party is at right we're using the fact that this bishop on f6 is basically immobilized it cannot move from this diagonal because of the possibility of checkmate and uh the rest is is relatively straightforward we want another pawn we get the king out we want to third pawn we hung the fourth pawn and then we delivered checkmate um and in the last game we again successfully employed the move h4 now probably black should still play h5 this is the lesser evil uh even though he does weaken t5 my guess and this is actually a line i mean people play this stuff with black i don't like it personally and partially because of it you'll see me playing h4 against other gms right i'm not trying to peddle stuff that that's somehow you know very dubious i'm telling you stuff that i would do myself thank you uh even that's very sweet uh and uh it's great to be appreciated so he allowed us to push the spawn all the way to h6 push harry up all the way to h6 and notice what we're doing here we're not we're not following up with g4 or anything like that we're just developing our pieces because the pawn on h6 is perfectly well defended he's got no way to reinforce his attack on the h6 pawn and we play e5 we take the pawn we go d5 we continue to expand in the center create weaknesses that he uh allows us to create more weaknesses from right now we go upon def queen to d5 uh and and these weaknesses start multiplying eventually transform transforming themselves into a tactic right so this entire game was decided basically by weak squares and these weak squares eventually allowed us to transform them into a direct tactical sequence okay um can black also develop the knights f6 yeah so that's something to consider but the move e5 here would be quite problematic that's why not having any of the central bonds out could be dangerous because here black must again allow h5 if he tries knight h5 uh well then the knight is on the rim and that creates its own set of problems um so so i'm not sure that this would be a long-term solution for black okay so once yeah once the spawn reached h6 the funny thing is if we fast forward all the way to the end first of all in the end game if you want tips about the end game piece activity is crucial you want all of your pieces to be active okay and if there's one piece that is not doing anything in the end game that's a pretty bad sign that's why we lifted the rook up all the way to c7 then you look at pawns that may potentially become past pawns and you try to make a note of them right this h6 pawn is far advanced far advanced pawns are important in the end game because with material being so limited it is much harder simply mathematically speaking to stop pawns from promoting okay and so that is why i found the mover of takes g6 because i realize that this pawn is two steps away from promotion if we can dislodge this h7 pawn then our pawn is going to promote and if he doesn't take on g6 well then we are going to forcibly remove the h7 pawn and promote our own pawn after that uh but but but hopefully that was satisfactory for for now i think i'm going to go now and sleep for a couple of hours so but i just wanted to say how much i appreciate uh and whoa man i'm i'm getting bribed 500 bits by travman curious chimpanzee with 100 bits uh and another thousand bids by phineas gage uh and encore is called for uh given this incredible uh support that we've had today um all right fine fine well especially because people are continuing to bribe me smoke brandon subbing with switch prime we have ob 68 with 100 bits uh man this hype train has rocketed out of the station bologna bolognese at tier one another hundred bits by j root holy smokes all right let's get that game on the road we are playing 1287 hmhk all right let's go c5 and let's get another uh sicilian and we've been playing the sicilian for the last couple of games and now we play g6 i'm gonna disable the alerts just for this game thank you drunky skunky okay so we already know that we're not afraid of him taking on c6 and can somebody remind me how did we decide to capture the last time and for what reason thank you for the 100 bits modern algebra what what is the the recapture that i like yes so we played dc uh now i know most people want to capture toward the center but we open up the bishop and we're gonna basically do the exact same thing trapman gifting five trav man 9 25 5 gifted subs this is incredible now where should this knight from g8 go can somebody illustrate for me the general plan that black has here and we literally had the same position a couple of games ago so this is a perfect perfect way to cement our understanding we play 97 and our idea is to push f5 and expand on the king's side eventually transforming that into an attack on white's king first we're gonna castle okay he's probably gonna play bishop okay bishop g5 now we don't want to play f5 immediately let's first chase away the bishop and see where it goes okay well he takes the knight great we'll just take back we've got two bishops against two knights that's a pretty damn good deal uh and we are ready to play f5 let's go f5 he's probably gonna take it and then we're gonna take back with the pawn and again the same litmus test that i recommended we can use here does he have a lot of pieces on the king's side not really right he's got a lot of pieces clustered in the center but they're all sort of awkward they're not enough to constitute any real pressure on my center because my own uh well my own pieces are nicely clustered in the center particularly the bishops uh and you can see by the move knight h2 that white is starting to fold over a little bit now where should we now continue our development what should we do and let's be calm here no need for anything crazy let's just complete our development and that's kind of the theme of the first half of the speed run almost is is you know despite an unbalanced position we just continue adhering to general principles some people are saying bishop d7 i'm going to develop it to e6 i feel like it's a little bit more active and the bishop from g7 is actually doing a great job supporting that pawn on e5 f3 that is a very ugly move now what exactly makes it ugly well as we already know the main thing that makes a move like f3 ugly not to mention the knight on h2 being locked out is the fact that it opens up this diagonal the a7 g1 diagonal to be exact and to show you guys the sort of algorithm of thinking we can actually make a semi-tactical move that immediately exposes the uh sort of erroneousness of of this move f3 the error behind we can play c4 this is actually a typical idea in these kinds of sicilian lines although we don't always play c4 because this diagonal is weak and how do we follow up with this move queen c5 we can even play queen b4 by the way green b4 is also possible uh but this is the the sort of the clinical way check we will take the pawn back and because the position is open up this benefits the bishops he uh is at risk of losing exchange and if he plays queen f2 which is the only way to save an exchange why does it save the exchange uh because uh it it counter attacks our queen and if we take his queen that the same rook that is being attacked takes our rook but there's a very five head move here okay and the concept that uh essentially brings that essentially brings this move out is what i call trading on our own terms trading on our own terms we want to find a move such that when he takes on c5 we make some sort of specific improvement to our positioning everybody finds bishop f8 i love to see it bishop f8 is what i had in mind there were several other ways we could do that we could have also slid our queen to b6 so then when he takes it we open up that a file for our rook that would have also been a very interesting way to trade on our own terms this is exactly what i mentioned when i said keeping the tension that is very hard to do people are uncomfortable when they do it but it reaps tremendous benefits if you do it properly now what should we do here because the window of opportunity for the queen trade has passed but now we can take the queen we take the queen and how can we follow up what should we do what are the next two moves that we make here in order to fully activate all of our pieces and i want a chorus of people saying this bishop c5 is right first first and foremost we attack the rook send it back so that the other bishop pins it and then we have one more piece to activate that would be the rook and we are going to send that rook over to d2 to collect a bunch of the puns or perhaps just the knight now again our opponent okay very good here's what i hate i hate looking at this bishop and saying this bishop is locked out this bishop has to join in on the action this is not fair how how do we make sure this bishop joins in on the yeah let's crash through his defenses he doesn't have enough pieces to hold this measly wall this pawn on c4 in place i suppose he can play rook c1 uh but that would tie his rook down to the defense of the pawn now this guy is again i'm playing some very underrated folks let's get the rook to d2 and uh i'll concede to him that he has he has succeeded in keeping my bishop out of this diagonal but that's what makes bishops so strong they're very resilient and they're able to reposition themselves very very quickly so uh he's got knight g3 he's attacking the pawn how do we simultaneously defend the pawn and reposition our bishop to greener pastures where should we put that bishop we go no f4 weakens a lot of squares be very careful about the move f4 f4 is very tempting i understand that but when you push a pawn you always want to understand what weaknesses it creates now we go king f7 to stop a fork on f6 the bishop is going to reposition itself to e6 to keep the rook tied down f4 is pretty useless because we just push the pawn with e4 his position has begun to crumble look at how throughout the whole game his knights are just stuck essentially on the h file doing nothing let's complete our repositioning bishop e6 now we have to ask ourselves okay what is going to be the subsequent plan of action first of all we can collect some of the hanging pawns right we can take on a2 but i don't even want to take on it i want to extend our domination completely and again the concept of trading on our own terms how do we make sure that we trade on d2 on our own terms there's two good possible ways of doing that the first is rook eda which a lot of people are suggesting the second is what we are going to do which is e3 this kills two birds with one stone simultaneously we push our past pawn and we prepare to push it even further when we recapture our rook this is something that we have to do with a granite okay so rook here now look at this knight for a second this knight is actually very vulnerable and we're going to attack it by playing rook g8 and if the knight moves then the g2 pawn is at risk of falling he does have 92 however okay goes in that f1 let's take on a2 and i'm going to accelerate the speed of my play a little bit because we're short of time but the hard work has already been done and now all that remains is the easy work he's played knight takes e3 what is the problem with this move nobody worry guys i will win this game i just want somebody to tell me what the issue of this move is he blunders the knight on g3 the game is essentially over because now he's got to move the knight again and then the chain reaction basically starts okay so now we take here look at how both rooks are hanging so if he takes one rook i take the other and this is where the real daniel neridisky shows up and just give me a second guys i want to make sure i don't lose on time okay so this is why i told you i will not flag and i promise for this reason okay let's take off the mask we've shown up to the party this is checkmate uh but in any case i i knew that it might seem like i'm cutting it close but the reality is at that point the position was already winning uh and and that was a great game i mean that was a very rich very rich game uh full of sort of interesting tension okay um maybe i should threaten to leave again we're almost 1300 that was our goal when we began this part of the speed run and we are already at a level where we are beginning to play serious people uh people who know what they're doing who have plans who don't blunder often uh and i know that for some of you that's pretty exciting ones okay um now just to quickly go over the game basically the smooth dc i want people to understand that things like capture toward the center right yes that is a valuable principle and most of the time you should adhere to it but here we're playing dc because i want to open up the bishop and it's not that i really need another prawn in the center right the movie five is plenty good enough we have these two pawns exerting this bind over the d4 square and now we execute the sort of traditional plan of playing f5 now if he plays a move such as rook add1 and i want to illustrate through the lens of this move black's main idea what does black do can somebody tell me what black's move is and what the long-term plan is those of you who play the king's indian should have a pretty easy time borrowing extrapolating that plan to this position because the fundamental idea here is very much i would say the same we actually play thank you so much trav man a huge shout out to that guy uh for a total of 70 gifted subs today uh incredible incredible stuff and the support was absolutely unreal and also 5 500 bits so that was awesome okay the move is f4 we lock up the center why do we lock up the sub when we lock up the center it becomes easier to attack on the side of the board now we're going to start attacking on the king side we're going to do that by essentially just pushing up our pawns very slowly very surely that is why knights are just so bad they're not able to make anything happen on the other side of the board because we've put our pawns on squares such that he cannot open up the center and look at the pawn on c5 it is a trooper it's stopping d4 and it's also controlling the b4 square making it very hard for white to make any sort of counterplay on the other side of the board okay so this is essentially what black's plan would be i'm too tired right now to illustrate exactly how this would unfold but hopefully people can fill in the blanks and in the in the game he played this move f3 and immediately he weakens this diagonal we play c4 queen c5 bishop c4 and the rest is just very simple there were two instances here of trading on our own terms the first was this one bishop f8 right we want to simultaneously deploy our bishop and trap his rook we don't just willy-nilly take the queen the second instance of trading on our own terms look at b5 either we get our bishop back into the game or as happened in the game we tie his rook down to the defense of a measly pawn and then again in this position trading on our own terms e3 right take my rook absolutely be my guest but guess what there's a price debate for that that price is that you get this pawn all the way to d2 now we put bishop takes c4 rookie one and we take on f1 so that is how effective it is really to think about trading on different terms now we identify hanging pieces we see that knight on g3 is undefended blah blah blah we take the knight we take the knight again uh and and and look at this situation where both rooks are hanging if he takes one rook we take the other one that's actually a pretty common situation and the rest is essentially checkmate all right so that was basically this game was a pretty well thought out game and i think that that was a fitting encore uh to i think a really really good run of course one could argue that we are within 17 points of 1300 so it would make sense to stick around and achieve 1300 but i think that everything must come to an end we have to be patient there will be more opportunities for the speedrun so i think we had a productive session um sleep does sound like a very good option right now uh i might make my way to the couch and uh sleep to the tune of the tv but yeah uh again the [Music] support today has been incredible this is an epic stream uh and the last time i said this we had another outboard of support so i might never end up leaving but i think this time i will actually go to sleep so thank you guys so much that is always in i always like to be bribed but this time i'm going to going to sleep for sure it's 5 am i need some shedding
