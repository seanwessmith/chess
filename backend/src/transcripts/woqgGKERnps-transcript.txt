okay let's continue short simple games thus far today 1850 ladies and gentlemen that's our first 1800 let's go let's hope he doesn't abort [Music] because we're too low-rated okay so akarokan now there's many lines that i recommend in the karoka but uh let's play a very simple system uh if we will which is e takes d5 the exchange fire gun and it's very important in this position i taught this to charlie to go bishop d3 to stop his bishop from coming out to f5 now we are going to go c3 to build a pawn chain and here we need to develop the knight from q1 knight f3 is actually inaccurate can somebody tell me why why is knight f3 a little bit inaccurate what does it allow black to do very conveniently it allows black to go bishop g4 so instead we're going to go knight e2 and the idea is that bishop g4 is no longer a very yeah he goes bishop g4 but now we can actually get rid of the pin by going queen to b3 you guys might be thinking well wait a second why couldn't you do the same thing with the knight on f3 well if you kind of visualize this and i'll show this after the game if knight f3 bishop g4 queen b3 he can actually take the knight potentially and ruin the pawn structure on the king side which is quite bad because we're probably going to castle to the king's side okay here we can just continue developing we've unpinned ourselves bishop defends the knight now he wants to get his bishop to d6 what should we do about that what should we do about that bishop f4 simple he can actually still go bishop d6 that's theory but let's see if he knows this this is okay no knight d2 let's develop the knight and he's probably gonna castle and now let's tickle him always a good idea and uh now we need to improve thank you squi for the prime we need to improve our pieces now if we take a look at our knights right you guys see how these knights are they're a little bit passive so first of all we can take this knight and put it on g3 and now now that he's castled by taking on g6 we make a weakness in his pawn structure if he wasn't castle the rook was on h8 i'd be reluctant to do that because the rook would have access to that h file but here that h file is completely innocuous let's improve the other knight knight f3 simple very simple straightforward chess let's see what he does absolutely well let's think about where we want to position our rooks now rook a1 would be a little bit mean to the other rook that other rook would end up on f1 and it would be a little bit bad so let's go rook f1 now i don't know where i'm going to put this other rook yet but at least i give myself greater freedom okay he attacks our queen we're going to move it and now we need to come up with a plan now if you guys remember uh we took on g6 which made him take with a pawn i introduced a concept to you guys in the in the two games ago called a hook a hoke is when there is a pawn next to the king that is not on its initial square and we can use a hook in one of two ways we can sacrifice a piece on it or we can use our pawns to sort of hook into that hook and make further weaknesses on our opponent's king side now we're not going to go h5 yet that's going to be a blunder how are we going to set up the move h5 think about it this way right after h5 he's probably going to take that's going to open a direct line toward his king so we want to go knight g5 because after that happens we want to be poised to deliver potential checkmate on h7 we'll have to distract the knight from s6 but we can do that actually by sacking it on h5 okay by the way we should also be already considering uh sacrifices like rook takes e6 although all of that is quite dubious okay order of operations order of operations our bishop is hanging let's take it and what are we ready to do after he takes what are we ready to do after he takes push now queen f4 will be a very strong move here let's see if he finds it i i saw it don't worry and i have a really strong response to it in mind but i think it's the only way for him to get a feasible position otherwise he could get checkmated now if g takes h5 can somebody remind me of the move is is queen age seven there is that checkmate and if not and how do we make sure that it will be checkmate a very simple deflection of course it's not mate because the knight guards the square but we can deflect the knight good job guys knight takes h5 and he finds now it's okay he's attacking the knight which means that if he take the pawn he takes our knight but we immediately need to ask ourselves the next question can we move this knight away with tempo we don't need to panic we don't need to sack we need to ask ourselves whether we can move this night away with tempo can we move the night away with tempo be can after the game i will explain why sacrifices are bad in this position now here's the thing uh and this is the reason he's in trouble because he has to move his queen but look at the pawn on f7 do you guys see that that pawn is overloaded it has to defend both at e6 and now it has to defend g6 so black is going to lose a font uh not it's actually not that simple but basically that's what's going to happen now you'll see why it's not that simple if he correctly takes with the queen but you got to be flexible right we wanted to attack he defended against the attack but in defending against the attack he created other weaknesses which we're explaining this is what flexibility is you've got to be able to stop on a dime and completely change your strategy at any moment based on what your opponent does you can't have that one track my oh i wanted to attack okay what should we do i kind of gave away the move should we just take the rook and give him the e file is that something that we usually do no okay one we keep control of the e fun knight f4 would blunder the night my friend remember there is a queen on h6 so knight f4 would allow queen to except for but also knight f4 would not be good because he could even take on e6 and then we wouldn't have control of the e file okay let's unpack this move he's attacking our rook now option one would be to trade on e8 twice that would be fine because we're up a pawn but um i don't really want to do that you know i want to keep control of the e-file how can we do that how can we control yak we need to malcolm on fire now believe it or not this allows a very interesting tactic but let's see what what he does now how should we go about thinking about this position well this night on h3 do you guys see any prospects for this night potentially where can this night potentially end up so where do we want this knight and you guys are already telling me the correct idea um which is that the knight wants to get go to g5 and we need to prepare that by playing f4 we cannot go knight g5 because that would blunder the knight okay but first let's take on on e4 i'm not blundering rook takes c6 because because y why is rook takes c6 not just winning a rock because knight g5 checked what should we do now what should we do now guys knight g5 of course that's our plan now if he takes with the knight then we can take the knight back but we can immediately take the rook on yad and win the game so he has to move his king back now after he moves his king to ga which he will we have to be very careful and find the accurate move because if we take his knight then we drop our rook on e6 okay and we can't do that so what we'll need to do and rook takes ca gives up the e file which i don't want so we need to find a way to do two things we need to get our queen away from this pin and preferably we need to defend the rook on e6 so that we can play knight take c4 we need to prepare this move in other words queen a6 is possible but why why so complicated we can simply yes a good job queen g4 and that said his position collapses the game is over he's lost exactly simple chess queen g4 we're threatening knight 64. he's going to end up two pawns down he could get smothered mated here it's crushing absolutely crushing and there are 1700 yeah rookie 8 queen b5 would also be good so okay now bishop d3 i'll skip the opening because it was quite simple again knight f3 here allows bishop g4 and this pin is a little bit scarier than this pin first of all we can play f3 should the occasion arise but also we can simply underpin ourselves with quick queen v3 and and we don't need to worry about this because we can simply take back now bishop f4 knight d2 by the way why can he go bishop d6 ah doesn't this blunder upon could somebody tell me doesn't this uh yes i beat andrew rook b8 of course and rook takes p2 restoring material equality and cutting into black white spawn structure but he played bishop b7 key question what happens if i do it anyway ask yourself the sam shanklin question if your opponent prevents an idea you should spend at least 10-15 seconds asking yourself what happens if i do it anyway because that can unlock your brain and it can sort of help you eat into those assumptions you make which prevent you from finding certain moves improving the knight improving the knight improving the rook and then asking ourselves okay what defects in black's position can we take advantage of and we notice that he's got a deficient king side what is what does that mean specifically he's got a hook on g6 how do we use a hook we use it with our pawn by advancing it first here then we prepare h5 with knight you five and then the key moment was here this is the critical moment of the whole game now what i want you guys to understand is that an attack and i've talked about this before is a function of two things a successful attack depends on two things being true number one uh is the fact it number one are the presence of pieces an attack can't happen unless there's a certain amount of a firepower of horsepower literally and figuratively involved in the attack number two weaknesses in your opponent's king side or or the area where your opponent's king is if neither of those things are true then an attack has very little chance of succeeding so if you think of a graph right yeah okay so let me let's go to microsoft paint let's go to microsoft paint it's time to make another painting and uh okay x-axis and y-axis and we're going to draw a sort of a an asymptotic graph sorry we don't want the fill here we want red and we want a brush no we don't want a pencil though what i want a thick brush you want a thick brush there we go so this graph uh successful attacks successful attack very very neat handwriting too successful attack i swear i have good handwriting now on the um x-axis here uh is the sorry on the y-axis jesus um our oh my god this is embarrassing i'm like he drew a half pipe exactly um f of x equals kappa yeah it's fine is um number of pieces and on this axis is weaknesses so what this shows is that and and let's call this um like let's do this in terms of like evaluation like eight whatever six four two zero i don't even this doesn't make any sense at all what i'm trying to show is that you have two defining main defining factors in an attack number of pieces and the amount of weak squares so a single queen can conduct a successful attack if your opponent's king is basically you know naked but you could also have a situation where you have five pieces in the attack but your opponent's king is super well defended the attack fails you guys see what i'm saying i suppose you could say there is you know an attack is the function of two variables uh i guess you need some calculus here number of pieces and weaknesses anyways guys sorry back to the back to the speed run so why is a move like knight takes f7 bound to fail because if we consider our function here that we drew we have one piece in the attack only one does black have any real weaknesses on his king side like are there any specific targets that you guys can identify here i know but i want to entertain you guys queen protects h6 not really no targets and black has one two three four pieces in the defense so you can rule this out without any calculation minimal minimal calculation you can rule this stuff out that's what i'm trying to show okay h takes g6 rookie 7 and again the rook protects e6 um i know i'm i'm kidding so while this is an admirable attempt that's why i was so dismissive about it now queen takes g6 would have been better because after queen takes g6 f takes g6 okay it's back to the chest please can somebody explain to me why rook takes c6 doesn't just win a pawn for free because b2 hangs question two should we therefore play b3 is b3 a good idea no why not because it leaves c3 super super weak and so black can counter attack that pawn what should we do how should we go about defending b2 while making a move that is also conducive to our long-term pressure on the e6 pawn we should go rookie 2 double rooks and involve this knight via g5 now the fact of the matter is black can protect the spawn but not for long because once we put a knight on g5 this pawn is going to be indefensible so that's what we would have done and black is still in very big trouble in the cent game so in my opinion after knight h3 black is much worse let's check our accuracy shall we i'm just curious to see what our accuracy was in this game i think we actually played a nice game 94 yeah pretty is pretty solid so you know this isn't bs i'm playing my full strength here any questions not much longer i'm running out of gas i did play 250 game match earlier against andrew his primary mistake was well first of all bishop e7 is inaccurate second of all i think that um like somewhere here okay i think you should have got knight takes d6 and like i don't know maybe like takes and 94 defends i'm not sure actually uh but at this point like we uh we're already applying some pressure so he made a series of very small inaccuracies that kind of accumulated um would it have been better for him to not trade his dark square bishop yeah probably he could have kept it he probably could have kept it but uh already at this point he's in some trouble why didn't we go 95 before he won knight c4 because our queen is hanging so i suppose we technically can do this but why trade so many pieces when we're eventually trying to attack his king right okay barring any further questions let's play one or two more and call it a night okay well we've got 2 500 viewers which is awesome if you could give this player one tube to improve what would it be well i would basically say um yeah so study a little bit of this karo khan theory but um yeah anyways so i won the match guys by a score of approximately 110 to 90. uh and uh the funny thing is i he's higher rated than me now but um i'll get back to 3 500. okay let's continue rakesh tiagi let's go e4 as we usually do and he goes with the modern which is g6 we simply develop our pieces and occupy the center and what move um i am tired but this is just my passion so what move should we play here with white 26 bucks by flying chef thank you so much man should we go bishop e3 yes we should now we can go f4 that's the austrian attack but let's play bishop b3 why are we playing bishop e3 because we are remember when we have control of the center we want to develop our pieces in such a way that we actually lend some support to the center you guys already know what the move is here we've played it many times before thank you so much man what should we do we should not play queen d2 immediately the problem with queen e2 immediately is that he has the nasty little move knight to g4 and so we should go f3 in order to prevent the move knight g4 and and prepare queen t3 obviously we are going to be castling long which is the reason why f3 is acceptable what is the purpose of queen d2 there are two reasons we prepare castling but there is a secondary reason and that secondary reason we can literally just play on the board right now well we can start with h4 um we can actually do that but the top priority is to eliminate his strongest piece and he correctly strikes in the center with c5 now what should we do here ladies and gentlemen since we are trading his bishop we can now play the move what which would be not good if we weren't trading his bishop because this move that we that i'm about to play it would be a bad move uh in theory because it actually opens up his bishop what am i talking about i'm talking about the move d5 right we opened the diagonal for him but because we trade his bishop this move is fine but let's not take his bishop yet we can try to squeeze as much juice out of this as possible what should we do instead of taking bishop a very typical attacking idea a very typical attacking idea we need to open up the h file because that's where we're going to checkmate him now edog suggests a4 to stop b5 but let me tell you something we don't even have to stop b5 we can go straight for his throat with h4 okay because we are very close to just going h5 and opening up the h file and checkmating him watch what happens h5 he's probably gonna go b4 okay now here's what we're going to do we are going to now take his bishop on g7 watch very carefully i will explain this after the game if he would have played bc kind of mull over in your head what you would have done but i'll show that and guess what we do now what do you guys think should we move the night away hint no we can actually sack it sacrifice the knight we can take g6 hopefully he takes the knight so i can demonstrate no he doesn't he trusts us now we put the queen on h6 and we've got a beautiful battery here he's hanging by a single threat okay now our knight is being attacked we need to move the night we think about where do we move the night well one good idea is to maneuver this knight to a nice little central square on e3 i think 92 would be worse because that would block in the bishop so let's get this knight around to e3 this guy is good he's defending well now take a look at this knight and look at it very carefully where should this knight go where should this knight go ultimately it's a two-move maneuver think about its destination don't think about the next move think about the destination g5 look at this beautiful square it's exerting pressure on h7 and it's attacking e6 so let's go knight h3 knight g5 or knight h3 knight f4 but knight g5 is even better than knight f4 it's more stable there let's go now he has to go in 85 correct this knight is annoying can we well first of all let's let's castle let's complete our development let's not commit to anything quite yet and let's come up with a plan of action now the plan that i propose first of all we have not okay so he goes not f7 we need to trade which is not desirable but unfortunately it's a necessity and it's okay i have a an idea now where should we put the bishop thank you k for men where should we put the bishop we should put it on a weak square we should put it on support because it x-rays the queen of the king you guys might be looking at this and saying well wait a second his pawn's on d6 what are you talking about this bishop looks stupid remember potential energy kinetic and potential energy this bishop has a ton of potential energy if this diagonal opens up and we can actually make that happen eventually by playing e5 now first of all he wants to go queen up for potentially a trade queens although that's actually not a threat as i'll show you guys but um let's first of all uh let's try to uh triple pieces on the h let's go rook h4 then double on the h file and then we'll potentially have a triple situation on the h file okay now let's see what he does now secondary idea is for us to go f4 and d5 as i mentioned earlier we want to open up this um this tag i'm actually going to go hmm this guy is good i'm actually going to go e5 yeah let's go e5 no this guy is playing extremely well and i'm cutting it close on the clock so let me focus for a second we're still doing fine i just i'm going to explain a couple of things after the game let's go d6 exposing his king and now we're going to go knight well actually no let me think yeah knight you four let me focus for a second guys yeah this guy is surprising me with his play quite a bit actually but we'll be fine don't try this at home though knight d7 there's a p6 check okay knight f8 we're up a piece we attacking the knight and we want to go d7 and promote the fun don't worry everything is under control everything is under perfect control yeah this guy is good um but um you know i'll explain the last couple of moves in a moment okay so yeah i can win this even with 10 seconds don't worry trust me i've been doing this for a very long time so why why was rook takes f4 bad idea here guys why why is rook takes a 4 of that idea here somebody tell me i won't make a move until somebody tells me knight e2 yeah now watch you see it's all going to be fine now that was a very tricky game this guy was good it was very very good now let's unpack some of these moments first and foremost a lot of people wonder why f3 is better than h3 could somebody explain to me why when you're trying to prepare queen d2 and stopping knight g4 what additional benefit does f3 have over h3 what additional benefit does this move have over this move compare them sorry thank you so much let's get some hype going for the prime i think we're over 3500 supporting the center right the more things you get done with the move the better so this supports the center now so boom boom we trade the bishops we go d5 to close up the center we could have gone a4 here to stop b5 maybe i should have because he kind of got a lot of counter play now first of all can somebody tell me what happens after knight takes h5 the board might be frozen yes sorry sorry sorry sorry can somebody tell me what happens after knight takes h5 here did somebody tell me what happens after knight takes h5 guys it's unfrozen please rook takes h5 queen g5 and this is as old as time and queen takes g7 checkmate is unstoppable now if he tries to play bc preemptively then we go queen to h6 right the queen occupies the square just vacated by the bishop and now we have a huge attack this is not worrisome because of rook to b1 okay now here what would have happened if b takes e3 some really interesting complications arise because of this could somebody tell me the next move in h6 now if king h8 then we go g74 the king of the rook so king g8 is forced white to play trick question do not make the tempting move this is not checkmate this is not easy to win but i believe it is winning we do not want to go g takes h7 check because the king is going to use this pawn as an umbrella and it's going to be perfectly safe so we want to actually go g7 and now we have this position now we need to think logically what does that mean that means that the queen wants to deliver checkmate on h7 but it cannot because there's a knight on f6 so the immediate next question has to be two questions number one can i get rid of this knight number two can i apply additional pressure on the h7 square now be very careful about how you go about doing that right f4 e5 is not correct because the e5 square is defended very well by the other knight but here's what we can try to do first of all this is what i would have done we can bring the knight to g5 and use that knight to capture h7 bishop d3 would be another very sneaky idea but he could put his knight on e5 to stop you from going e5 knight h3 knight g5 is unstoppable black simply i think has no way to stop nitro5 although maybe it's not that simple okay so bishop d3 uh he has 95 right does that make sense you can't go e5 now g4 is possible but here's the problem guys with g4 g5 the problem is that let's make a random move even if you do this and you play g takes f6 black's other knight replaces the first one so i get it you want a piece you're not going into this for a piece you're going to this for checkmate and so here you you have the same problem over again right you don't just want to get rid of the knight you want to get rid of the knight and and the other night as well you want to do it in a way that doesn't allow a block to get the other knight to f6 okay now if you go bishop d395 f4 then knight takes d3 check and uh you get a problem which is that if e5 well now black can go bishop to f5 and use the bishop to defend the pawn so bad stuff just kind of happens here so um yeah now you can do it jose but we've made random moves for black black is not going to make random moves trust me black is going to play cb and he's going to go queen a5 and queen takes a2 you have like one move to do something so that's why i think knight h3 is super important you have to act with a sense of urgency all right so here we got the knight around to a good square then we got the other knight to a good square then we went bishop c4 rook h4 to stop queen f4 he tripled we went up for e5 opening up the bishop and now i actually had a beautiful move knight g4 i just checked is kind of inaccurate we had to move f5 just crunching through his position he cannot take because of the pin and he cannot take the other way because the knight falls instead i went knight g4 in order to get my knight to e5 white is still better here and the pressure is immense even though we're in an end game and even though i'm up a couple of pawn i'm down a couple puns it doesn't matter because look at how active my pieces are and guess what piece wins the game it's the bishop the bishop that looked terrible wins the game because it has so much potential energy okay didn't we have 96 for a fork before at which point i'm not sure when you're referring to well 96 here remember his bishop can now take the knight simply okay so um i actually realized something and i made a mistake which is that queen of four is not actually a threat why can somebody tell me why this is not actually a threat rook takes h5 exactly very good and the rook simultaneously defends our queen boom boom and the game is off okay does 250 thank you so much does this make sense very good any questions last speedrun game yeah okay last game we are over 1700 am i eating okay oh yes 1800 again here we go you see guys we're playing good people but it's not okay he aborted i guess we'll go again 1712 exactly the same rating from russia of course oh then you take the queen by the way okay so french uh now in the french i'm gonna go knight to c3 which is the main line he takes that's what andrew tang plays and he goes knight f6 we take the knight now we develop very naturally here knight to f3 white is better in this line and now we have a very tricky move d3 let's see oh and he missed it we can win the game on the spot with what move ladies and gentlemen drum roll please that's why you don't bring your queen out before every other piece that's exactly why you don't bring your queen out in the opening that's why that piece of advice exists mr queen mrs queen where do you go miss ms uh my lady where where are you gonna go my lady uh here oh wait a second i think there's a knight guarding that's here oh wait no huh oh queen can't be trapped on move eight can it that's it game over he had to play h6 here that's theory theory is the move h6 stopping bishop g5 okay he's probably fuming right now yeah this is actually very typical so okay not bad uh i was like 160 okay he resigned so perfect time now for the last speedrun game okay b y cp let's play another sicilian and he plays the wing gambit so the wind gambit is something that sicilian players often fear the idea of the wing game but okay bishop c4 is bad the move is a3 there now um how should we go about playing this position well what do you guys think we should do yeah we should develop but how should we develop we have a pretty cool idea here which is to go knight f6 and this invites e5 but we have a very sexy move here can somebody find it a very sexy response and this response always exists when there is a bishop on c4 boom goes the dynamite d5 you guys might look at them and say wait a second he can go bishop b5 check he probably is going to do that in like the next five seconds okay no he took but by the way in that event of that we could have gone bishop to d7 counter-attacking his bishop and if he takes we play knight f takes d7 moving that same knight which is being attacked to take back the bishop here he's just in huge trouble look at our monster pawns we're up upon he's got nothing developed i mean this is just horrible for white f takes e7 we're going to take back with the bishop prioritizing our development over a meaningless check okay well well actually there's a couple things we could do right he wants to take this so what do you guys think that we should do can we maybe defend this pawn and make a development move at the same time it looks a little bit awkward but it's a really strong move malcolm tucker you are on fire my friend bishop e6 bishop b6 defending upon and developing our bishop now you guys might be looking at this and saying but wait this new bishop b6 you usually tell me not to play it because it obstructs the development of this bishop but this is an exception because obviously he's going to have to do something with the spawn and that's going to solve for us the problem of this bishop he decides to simply give that pawn away which opens up our bishop look how beautifully we've developed our pieces curly johnny thank you for the three months glad to hear that my friend glad to hear that okay c3 well we can take but let's go a5 to keep our beautiful pawn mass alive here and then we're going to complete our development and castle and we're going to win easily his bishop is also completely stuck because of this nice little pawn mass that we've got you're watching from san fran great okay knight c6 stopping knight d4 also bishop c5 getting the bishop on the most active square these moves i'm not really explaining because they're simple and okay so this is winning yeah this is interesting no the people are uneven i mean we're in a castle and let's see if i can play some regular bullet after that to finish no actually there's nobody online maybe some blitz regular blitz i'm not that sleepy for some reason i don't know why like i'm tired but i feel like going i'm feeling pumped for the match okay so let's unpack the situation have a way to trade queens here and um the simplest thing here would be to trade queens because we're up several pawns and we've got everything developed and uh i want to show you guys how to win in an end game how can we trade queens there's two possible moves here mr gambini are you on drugs drugs no i don't take drugs queen d5 or queen d3 is exactly right yeah i'm on adrenaline right now i am high on life as they say queen d3 is correct and um you know we're up two puns it makes sense to trade queens and then we're gonna get a beautiful pawn on d3 yeah queen d5 was just as good both moves were perfectly fine uh they were alternatives all roads lead to rome here okay so he takes it we're going to take and hopefully now i can show you guys end game technique so he activates his knight so um how should we go about um playing this position what should we do well first of all we need to identify uh where the sort of pressure points are right what's going on here what is the battle revolving around you guys see right that the rooks are in a standoff so does it make sense that if we can gain control of the of the a file then that would signify progress toward eventually infiltrating does that part make sense okay now um then we ask ourselves the next question right which is how do we get control of the a file and the idea of knight before knight c2 comes to mind okay knight before knight c2 would dislodge his rook from a1 and it would give us control of the a file but there is a problem and here's the problem if we go night before he can beat us to the punch with what move how can he beat us to the punch if we go night before he can go knight c7 first so here's what we're going to do we're going to go bishop b6 dropping back the bishop and preparing to go night before knight c2 prophylactic move looks mysterious but hopefully i've guided you guys through each sort of step of my thinking process here knight d6 okay that's okay he attacks our pawn on b7 but this is a completely innocuous move for many different reasons and i'm actually going to do something that looks crazy i'm going to sacrifice this pawn uh why am i doing that because i believe that the a file is so important that it's worth sacrificing a pawn over it because once we get a rook to the second rank and this speaks to perhaps the most important he doesn't even take it see how this worked peace activity in the end game is incredibly important sometimes even more important than material okay you want to make sure your pieces are active all right so now we want to centralize our bishop but first we want to reap the rewards of what we just did so let's go rook a2 okay i did not blunder that the knight defends the bishop the bishop is what we call a type 2 undefended piece what can we do beautiful guys beautiful bishop c4 that's it the game is over he's going to lose his knight and everything is going to collapse and this is a direct product of us getting the rook to a2 we won the battle over the a file and therefore we won the game actually oh no we didn't not yet ah just kidding okay we don't need to attack the bishop his knight is permanently pinned he has no way to save it he thought he could catch me like that he is wrong boom and we are up in exchange and the rest is very simple let's bring the bishop back to c4 let's now identify the weaknesses in his position and work toward attacking them the d4 pawn is the weakness that we can attack our past pawn and we can take it now as i've explained many times how do you win an end game like this in the most efficient way you identify where the past pawn is and you push it but here he just gives us a free knight now we couldn't have taken it immediately because bishop takes d4 and he resigns so um very simple d5 was the key move if bishop b5 checked we would have gone bishop d7 takes takes then e6 we would be up a pawn with a beautiful pawn chain so this was all very straightforward very straightforward queen d5 here would be perfectly good as well they would be alternatives although it's a little bit less forcing maybe he can drop his queen back here but queen d3 is quite forcing because it also attacks the knight right and here the move bishop e6 i want you guys to pay attention to this move right step by step logic where is the battle revolving around well the a file right that's the only standoff that we have we want to gain control of the eiffel how do we do that by dislodging his rook how do we dislodge his rook till the only possible ways to get the knight to c2 okay what's what's stopping us well he can do the exact same thing from his end and gain control of the a file so can we stop knight c7 first and then go knight before knight c2 that's exactly what we did rook a2 see that's how we want the game [Music] you
