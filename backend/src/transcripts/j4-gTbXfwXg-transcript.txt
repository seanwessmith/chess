okay so we're black and let's play something a little bit different let's play a knight or [Music] okay so he goes bishop c4 now you guys already know the drill okay great example of how to react he wants to intimidate us knight h3 what should we do here so normally we go e6 but here let's modify our strategy a little bit we don't have to go e6 immediately what can we do first first we can develop how we don't need to go h6 we don't need to stop the knife from coming to g5 we don't need to be afraid of that let's just go knight f6 simply knight f6 we don't need to do anything crazy and uh here we can go either d5 or e6 but we've mostly been preparing the move d5 so let's do this ladies and gentlemen takes and what should we do now and this really emphasizes how crappy his opening idea has been i see e6 but you guys are missing something we should take the knight don't forget he's put a knight on h3 we should take the knight and as i always say in these situations it's not to ruin his pawn structure it's in order to ruin his king side so that we can attack his king that's the main rationale it's not about his pawns not looking pretty so we can castle long here but one of the biggest misconceptions i want people to take out of their minds is that you have to castle long in order to cast in order to attack on the king's side that's not true we can castle this way and i guarantee you guys that we can still attack on this side of the board and i will show you how now attacking is misunderstood because in order to attack the key element is we need to bring our pieces into the game no attack is going to happen unless we have active pieces so let's activate our pieces one by one and there's many ways of doing that what i like is to get the rook to the open file this is the most flexible we're not committing to a position of the queen yet and now we can do what i call carving out there is a square which we can carve out for our knight who can tell me what i mean by that i've already illustrated the concept of carving out so you guys should be familiar with this term and if you look at the center very carefully we can see that the e4 square is a prime real estate for the knight if we go d4 he goes e4 c4 and he stops our knife from getting to d5 thank you your knock but we can go c4 and he has no equivalent because the e4 square is going to be weakened but before we put our knight to e4 and yes we're going to sacrifice upon what should we do first we don't we don't rush we first ask okay how has the position changed aha this diagonal has opened so we can activate our bishop first with a check and here's the thing we're actually going to take the pawn on c4 this is not an easy move to explain why why am i not playing 94 well part of the reason is that i want to open up that d file first and we can reap the rewards of that immediately with what move and this move is going to be quite devastating now what move can we play let's get this guy over here and this game is over um he's look at his position he's underdeveloped and he's gonna get absolutely destroyed here and and i will explain the logic behind that after the game i know that it might seem weird why didn't we put the 94 even though i said we would do that we might still do that but um this was a much better execution of the idea okay 92 is the only move thank you jose joss pam in the chat the man himself absolute beast appreciate it now how do we think about this position well the rook on f1 if we take it it'll be checkmate so the problem is the knight is defending that rogue our sort of default pattern recognition should be can we undermine this knight can we make it move yes we can we can play knight e4 bishop b3 would have also been possible but it's better to do this by activating simultaneously as many pieces as we can okay what should we do now let's not panic um oh my god we have a we have a very cool idea here but with no need for any fanciness we can simply go queen to e2 and we reinforce the idea right if he takes the knight we can still take the rook the game is over everything is hanging we're threatening 50 different checkmates it depends what he does but these are the consequences of not developing your pieces at a fundamental level it doesn't matter if you're 2000 or 500. the cool idea was knight g3 check but it gets a little bit chaotic there the cool idea i don't think oh shoot i think it did work but it was a long line oh that would have been pretty sexy no but i'll show you guys the whole sequence and it's a little hard to follow trust me on that one okay thank you and goodbye absolutely i'll show you guys do i ever not show you cool ideas do i ever not show you cool ideas okay here's lines okay obviously knight h3 was just dumb i i have no idea where he got this from and and we shouldn't be deterred by moves like these so knight f6 right uh the reason after knight f3 that we don't play knight f6 is well we actually can but he's got e5 whereas here e5 is not uh not possible all right you guys can hear the sound right yeah okay so d3 e6 castles d5 all very simple bishop takes h3 right that's the key key idea a bishop d6 here is tempting but not as good because he can give a check don't forget that when we play d5 we open up the e5 okay so castles here we play rookie eight and here the fun starts and the move d4 is correct in its intention and um knight d5 is a good idea but he plays c4 remember to always check for these kinds of moves and he deprives our knight of this square and that's why we play c4 because we're almost guaranteed to have access to this square so d takes c4 bishop c5 activating the bishop first and now the move d takes c4 very important um knight e4 first of all would have been very much possible black is still better here i have no doubt about that but d takes c4 opens up the maximum amount of real estate in the center and in a position like this which has such a big disparity in development uh it's not even about putting your pieces on good squares so much as it is about opening up the position as much as possible thank you calhour and riera for the primes okay uh and patience is also very important here we don't need to rush with any particular move in this position we will get our pieces to the good squares you need to trust in the potential energy of your pieces and you want to make sure that when you're actually cashing in you've probably heard the expression the threat is stronger than its execution and what i see a lot of people do is they they notice a good square for a piece and they immediately put it there they put their head down it's a form of tunnel vision at a high level but by not rushing we are able to ensure that when we do play knight e4 94 which happened here it comes with maximum effect because we've opened up this avenue for the queen i don't know if that makes sense maybe i'm talking too generally but that's sort of the rationale behind the movie takes you for it it's actually nothing to do with us trying to like not lose upon that's completely not the idea the idea is to open up this pathway for the queen it just visually opens everything exactly so our bishop is hanging but so is the rook um 9294 undermining the knight and in this position we had a very sexy idea how did i find this idea the first thing i noticed is that i really want the rook to be on e1 because that could create the potential for checkmate so logically speaking we want to move the knight away with check um and knight g3 check accomplishes that task even if it sacrifices the knight to two pieces now he takes either way he loses rookie one that's kind of cool queen e2 and this is going to be checkmate in a couple moves if he plays um brook takes g3 it's the same exact thing check and checkmate but the reason i rejected this is because he can play king gt using this knight as a pathway to escape to g3 but i calculated this a little bit further rookie two check king takes g3 this is where i stopped calculating initially but afterward i realized that black is a very sexy move in this position which uh you know i think allows the attack to succeed could somebody spot it we use the pin bishop f2 is correct nicely done rook cannot take the bishop because of the pin if the king goes back then we drop the bishop back with a discover check shutting down its escape to g3 and now you guys should be already familiar with the checkmating pattern rookie one and queenie two cut bernie with a prime let's get this hype train out of the station appreciate it guys thank you so much if he goes forward then this is a classic king hunt i think there are several ways to give checkmate one of them is to go h5 if king h5 then queen f5 is made i call 15. if king g5 i'm sure we probably have some sort of beautiful mate but f6 here is the sort of business approach i'm loving them too and queen f5 of course he can give up the queen on f6 curious chimpanzee here we go five gifted to the community thank you so much sorry guys i didn't mean to do that thank you so much curious chimpanzee let's check with the computer knight g3 was indeed winning yep this was winning but queen e2 was just as good this is so overwhelming that it would have been just as good thank you so much curious chimpanzee five gifted to the community um narrow bridge swoops xc the prince the price annie blasting and dtp sun thank you so much okay uh and after queen e2 the threats against his king are completely overwhelming and so he plays queen c5 which technically is a blunder but there's really no nothing he can do he's completely paralyzed we want to take everything in the house okay and that's all there is to it that's all there is to the attack that we that we conducted okay what is the move that made him lose well i already think knight hd set him up for failure and i think that in this position he's much worse i mean honestly i think that the fact that he took on d5 is a big reason why he lost he he should not have taken on d5 he should have played bishop e5 and bit the bullet and uh the reality is if i if i grab the pawn too quickly thank you gigahertz then you know he can play knight g5 and he can sort of worm his way around the edges and try to get some compensation i wouldn't have done that the very least white is somewhat in the game uh i almost think that by giving me the opportunity to take on h3 uh my advantage ballooned to almost decisive proportions holy smokes this is the same ending leo origami five

would have been what he should have done he probably shouldn't have taken the pawn but if he had gone d4 then i would have occupied this beautiful outpost and it's okay i would have used the e-file i would have used the e-file you know it's not as wide of an expanse as the whole center but with how weak his position is i think this would have been enough uh thank you chance 10 10 by 10 i

talk a little bit about this opening afterward and what do we want to do if we're white here as i've explained several times when our opponent plays an opening like this there's always a temptation to grab as much of the center as possible thank you but that's something that i that i that i recommend people to sometimes avoid you want to get some of the center so here we want to go c4 and he's disconnected we want to chase the knight away from d5 but i wouldn't recommend going f4 although that is a legitimate move after we go c4 we want to make sure that we develop our pieces uh in such a way that we protect the center that we've claimed right it's almost like we've bitten off this big chunk and then we need to bring our pieces in so that we developed them and this move was so strong what a game that was an incredible game wow so strong that he literally disconnects his isb is beyond impressed with me right now yeah unfortunate that he disconnected but this gives me a chance to quackhead getting the sub and my lands leonard totor12 gift getting a sub as well music by jbm with 100 the isp gambit is right so the alakan gambit is very legit stragility thank you for the two months the alakan sorry not the alkyne game but the alkyne is very much legit and the alakan is part of the openings that are called hyper modern openings i've talked on several occasions about the history and the nature of hyper modern openings by and large they appeared around the 1920s by a group of players who contested the sort of conventional chess idea that you have to control the center with your pawns these are a group of players that say i don't think so you have to control the center of your pawns to some degree but what you can also do is you can provoke your opponent into biting off more than he can chew you can provoke your opponent into controlling the center with a million pawns and then you can snipe at these pawns with your pieces the alakan belongs to that group of openings black literally almost forces white's pawns as far into the center as possible d4 c4 there is even f4 the four pawns attack which is a very legitimate opening and then black finds ways to chip and crack away at that center yeah it is similar to the nim switch so in the four pawns attack for example uh black can play c5 or you know black and play uh knight c6 and you guys can see that he's starting to attack the pawns with his pieces uh and in the alakin that's why i said he played e6 which is not as effective because he's not immediately undermining my pawns and and so here for example i would not have played f4 i would have instead developed my pieces with knight c3 takes and knight f3 rather than controlling all of the center i would have controlled some of the center enough to give me a nice edge and develop my pieces that's often how you respond against these hyper modern openings now when you guys say the nimzovich is that e4 knight c6 so the nimzovich is a different opening right it there there is a difference between bringing the knight to f6 and c6 and the biggest difference is that you know white doesn't have the move e5 and the nimzovich often transposes to e4 e5 or you get a position like this this is also a hyper modern opening but it's more rare this is considered a little bit more dubious than the alkyne now there are people in the 16 17 1800 rating range to whom i do recommend the alakan i think the alakan is a very legitimate opening if black plays it very well it's actually not easy for white to prove a big advantage it's actually not that easy for white to prove an advantage at all and uh my good friend brian tillis national master is a very good opening analyst he's done the chessable repertoire on the alakan if you're looking into it uh by all means check out his course and i want to caution you guys as i have in the past i would say at least 1600 plus because before the principle i've talked about applies uh and yeah if you play the alakan well you can actually get big advantages with black and there are grand masters who played the alakan as one of their main openings even peter gionatus who i crap on all the time but he's a big alakan person and he's played it a lot with great results there's one thing i want to clarify for you guys don't fall into the trap of thinking that just because an opening is not like a tier because it's not e5 or c5 but it's crap this is not crap this is a very legitimate opening and if you're playing on the white side of it you should not expect yourself to get a winning position out of this opening okay you should give a little bit more respect to it uh and and that helps you respond in a more measured way that's exactly what players want you to think they want you to think ah this is this is total crap i can just you know control the center and i'm good and you know before you know it you you have a lost position so that mentality i think in my opinion is very very important to institute correctly in your mind well the thing is if black plays this correctly white's not going to get a chance to just run black off the board uh you can see that c5 is not possible here and and d5 is not possible here so white has to be a little bit more careful than that carlson has played it as well as you guys know okay um so so that's sort of a quick rundown of the alakan can i play the alakan in one of the games sure i'll play it in the next game since i've talked about the alakan and such in such um encouraging terms i would be happy to give you guys a sense of the alakan myself so let's go right knight of six that's a great idea actually thank you okay so he plays d5 this is a serious dude okay d6 and he goes bishop c4 so um this is a slightly different way of playing the alakan from white's perspective he uh prioritizes developing his pieces rather than controlling the center with his pawns uh if i remember correctly there is a p sacrifice line here with bishop takes f7 although i'm not sure this is here let me think for a second so i'm trying to remember okay so here's what we're gonna do because i'm a little bit worried there is some sort of trap line i'm going to protect that knight with my pawn i'm going to play a little bit so passive but solid passive but solid and there's something to be said for openings where yes you're slightly worse you're slightly passive but it's very hard to break them now let's develop our knight and attack the pawn on e5 let's force him to decide and after e takes d6 we're going to take with our bishop now we're going to allow him to play d4 he's going to have more of the center than we do that's okay because again we have very very solid piece placement let's take on e5 in order to pave away the diagonal for our bishop potentially look at how nicely our knight on d5 is placed nice solid knight where should we put our bishop e7 or c5 it's a slight kind of trick question actually believe it or not it's a bit of a trick question in my opinion we should actually put the bishop on isab why because if we put it on c5 we allow his bishop or his knight to get to the g5 square and that ladies and gentlemen is how you play the alakan defense and it wins the game by force in eight moves you can't make this stuff up i think it only happens in this speed run oh my lance here come the hundred gifts of bums after that game i mean this is just absolute mastery okay so i actually think that i didn't play this the best way let me actually check with a computer here so i was a little bit concerned about this move okay but that's actually not a move oh no it was just flicking g8 and now queen eight okay this is actually not a thing sorry i um i messed this up a little bit e6 is not the best because it blocks the development of our bishop knight b6 is the best move and then what we don't want to do is go bishop g4 this would be a big mistake who can tell me why this is a very typical tactic we've seen this many times before and um could somebody just remind me of why this doesn't actually work it's bishop f7 and knight g5 and he opens up the attack on the bishops certainly don't do that but um we play d6 which is solid knight c6 d takes d takes bishop b7 and of course bishop f4 is inexplicable what should white have done uh instead of this there are several ways that white can play here what i would have done is gone queen e2 and rook t1 trying to open up as much pressure on the knight as possible removing the knight from the board is the key to the position for white but white doesn't want to do it by taking on d5 that would actually get me a nice diagonal for my bishop so you don't want to do it in the brute force way but by going queenie to rook d1 you apply pressure on the knight and i think white is definitely in the driver's seat here i don't think white is like winning or anything like that but uh white is is definitely significantly better uh in this position so that's why you want to be careful in these openings you don't want to play them without proper knowledge thank you so much chest dojo live party at 131 unfortunately i was just about to end i'm quite out of gas i've been doing the speed run
