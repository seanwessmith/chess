[Music] do instead it's totally fine to actually just take the pawn and uh then we can complete our development and try to get that knight to d5 let's castle how can we try to get the knight to d5 could somebody chart for me a course that this knight could potentially take to land eventually on d5 second question how is bishop g4 often met what move do we like to play in these situations because it's just a helpful move and it forces him to sort of commit yes h3 so first of all let's make some luft for the king as many of you guys are saying 92 would blunder the bishop but the idea is knight a3 knight c4 and knight e3 and through e3 that's frankford airport that's where you can fly to all the good european destinations but before you can fly to european destinations you have to pass the airport security airport security's knight on f6 which controls d5 how do we hypothetically get rid of that knight and i probably maybe should have played this move first uh but we don't really have to get rid of the knight but how could we get rid of the knight bingo the smithslav idea i've shown that game a million times bishop to g5 let's make this move first because if i didn't play it he'd probably go h6 okay what should we do now do we take do we drop it back are you paying attention to what i just said if yes then you should yeah knight c4 guess what we're trying to get the knight over to d5 that's literally what i'm trying to do there's also a very nice tactical detail which he may allow us to demonstrate if he plays v5 okay he doesn't now there is a problem with knight e3 what we need to notice here ladies and gentlemen is that the d3 bishop is a type uh two undefended piece and it's defended by the queen the queen is overloaded so if knight e3 that severs the connection between f3 and d3 he can take on f3 and ruin the bishop a ruin ruin the bishop he can ruin the bishop but ruin the pawn structure is what i meant to say so what should we do yeah so g4 is possible but it kind of weakens the king side guys what we actually can do here and this is something which is sort of not unique to a high level you shouldn't be afraid to trade queens to accomplish what you want the d5 square is still a sexy outpost in the event of an end game that doesn't change uh so what bishop e2 accomplishes is now we don't have to worry about this knight being captured finally we are ready to go to d5 and he prevents us from going to d5 but in doing so he gets kind of passive now let's deal with this standoff i'm tired of this standoff so i'm going to go knight to d2 because uh i'm just tired of him constantly hanging this over my head and we are going to deal with this knight on e7 what this creates is a situation where he is quite passive okay so he wants to take on e3 there's not much i can do to to stop him and i should now i want to get this other knight to c4 the problem with knight c4 is that he's going to play b5 and chase away the knight can i prepare knight c4 how can i prepare knight c4 we can play a4 this is a kind of a king's indian idea i have to say this guy is also playing tremendously well he's playing on a 2600 level so i'm trying my best to nurture my positional advantage but uh this guy is is super super strong what should we take with what should we take with we should actually take with the knight exactly because now we have access to the square his knight is basically a slave to this square the queen can take the knights place on c4 so this knight on e7 is pretty immobilized as soon as it moves well as soon as it moves we're going to stick our knight on d5 and we're actually threatening a four which he misses and uh the moment the knight comes to d5 we basically win the game this isn't the entire story because once he moves his king how much material do we actually win here should we even take his queen let's do some calculation that's actually pretty poetic i have to say and i am going to disable the alerts during the speed run yeah we get the exchange we take on c6 we take on z8 now a lot of people here would notice the pawn on b2 and they would probably go b3 but we don't actually have to go b3 we have an even better move remember that when you are up in exchange taking off a pair of rooks would be essentially squarely in a favor but actually wait a second on second thought guys i am wrong because if rook d1 he is going to take his rook and then he's going to snap off the pawn on b2 and what i missed is that he's also going to be forking the a pawn so let's actually we will go b3 because he wins just a little too many pawns there and i'm afraid that even in the event of a rook trade we won't have any puns left so you know okay knight a5 now that uh knight takes b3 doesn't actually come with a fork uh we can go ahead and play rook to d1 rook after d1 would also be fine now if he takes on b3 yeah so he goes here how should we follow up uh we have now gained the defile but we need to squeeze the most out of that d file by playing rook to d7 we are making contact with this type 2 undefended pawn the knight is protecting it which means that b4 is a good move but let's instead start just taking all of his pawns here's one pawn here's another one we are now up upon end of the exchange and our ultimate long-term plan if he allows it if he doesn't go rook to d8 if he does uh we will deal with that but where should this work go yeah piggy's on the seventh stack up that seventh ring that is such a typical endgame idea and it's such a strong one because we are going to win this fun we are going to win the game okay um so pretty smooth and a nice positional game so d6 he kind of pre-moved i don't think he expected c3 uh and this gives white a very nice center we've sort of talked about this now at this level you can see that these guys they they um they make very reasonable moves right uh at an earlier rating c takes d4 was often the move that uh that was played against us hey montana chess and as you guys know the problem with this is it gives the b1 knight this e3 square it's very cooperative at this level you know they strike in the center they don't back down knight f3 knight c6 and i i take on c5 so the key the key property of this position that gives white that slight but stable advantage is that d5 square which is going to be a perpetual weakness there is no equivalent weakness on d4 because i have a pawn on c3 that's protecting that um so ultimately here is where i charted the chorus for the knight knight a3 knight c4 and 93 knight d5 now you guys might look at this and say well that's like four moves i've talked about the three move rule which is a good way to estimate whether an idea you have is realistic if it takes three moves or longer i often claim that the idea is unrealistic but you need to take that with a very serious grain of salt i'm not saying that i'm literally putting my head down and i'm going to make these moves in succession what i'm talking about is an ultimate goal not a plan where i make one move after the other move regardless of what he does so what we see in practice is i play knight a3 then i play bishop g5 and take his knight out right then i play knight c4 i don't even play 93 i'm making these moves uh in a very measured fashion so knight e3 bishop takes f3 allow or forces me to play gf and and ruin my structure uh by the way the nice detail if he goes b5 this may seem very nasty because after knight e3 uh what move does he now have so if you've been paying attention to what i just said not c4 c4 is not dangerous guys before he's not dangerous don't make a move just because it threatens a piece all right i don't want to see that bishop b2 you know better c4 is tempting don't fall for temptation in fact this becomes a very weak pawn chain uh which white can undermine with a4 undermining the b5 pawn the move is bishop takes f3 and here white has a very sexy response what's uh how do we find this move we put on our sam shanklin hats our sam glen hats tell us well if a move is impossible we first ask ourselves what happens if i do it anyway what happens if i do it anyway you must ask yourself that question you must allow yourself to look at certain positions and if you look at those positions and you have a better chance of not ruling stuff out instinctually play tao for president you play queen f3 anyway b5 pawn blocks the pathway back of the queen rook 81 traps the queen look at that so i saw that which is why knight c4 was justified and the queen is trapped black is busted if he goes knight c4 you can simply take the knight and nothing has changed so anyways that's what would have happened if b5 now you might ask well what's why can't we do this anyway here well the pawn is on b7 which means the queen can escape so it's very important not to generalize that's why we played bishop b2 and i think black probably should have gone for the end game i think the end game would have lessened to blacks load a little bit queen c7 93 97 i asked myself what happens if i do it anyway it only takes one second my claim to you guys is that once you consider queen f3 and you look at this position you don't need a grand master to find rook 81 okay everybody can see rock81 uh given this position it's just a matter of so i would divide tactical difficulty into two different categories category one is like stuff that is hard to let me let me think about how to formulate this category one is stuff that is hard to calculate so it's a move that everybody sees like a sacrifice but it leads to very chaotic uh contin at least to a very chaotic continuation and you have to calculate that and it's hard category two are things that are hard to see but not hard to calculate it's like a venn diagram okay hard to calculate r to see and then there's middle of the venn diagram which is both and that's the kinds of problems that grandmaster solved this is easy to calculate but very hard to see there's actually basically nothing to calculate and you have to try to train both of these skills if that makes sense okay so bishop b2 knight e3 now we go knight d2 a4 to prepare knight c4 white is slightly better there's nothing huge about white's advantage but it's an unpleasant position and he finally buckles this is my point when you apply pressure on your opponent for so long he's going to buckle rook d2 would be a good move forcing me to play the relatively passive rook b1 and black should be able to hold a draw with a couple of accurate moves this is probably already close to equal um and uh he plays knight c8 allowing knight d5 here what should black have done instead of knight b6 well how do i determine who is better basically the position is symmetrical with the exception of the d5 square so white's slightly better chess dojo live another raid 59 welcome everybody we are doing this speed run yeah rookie or uh you could also play king ha another two category thing is a threat can be dealt with by removing the symptoms or by removing the cause or ki removes the symptoms right e7 is defended but king h8 would remove the cause i actually prefer this move you often want to remove the cause because rookie 8 actually basically ties down your rook to a passive existence of that although in this particular case it doesn't really matter and then black can play knight p6 to trade the knights off or knight d6 to chase the queen away instead of course knight knight uh c8 knight b6 is a blunder it doesn't drop the queen but it does drop the exchange and the rest is very very straightforward any questions that was a pretty straightforward game uh our opponent was good but you know we didn't do anything we didn't reinvent the wheel just uh sort of typical rudimentary positional principles were uh rehearsed looks like everybody is pretty clear on what we did excellent let's continue okay jimmy fallon won 2400 okay so let's go e4 let's go e4 this guy is good e5 okay so here we're going to play my real openings i am going to play the rye lopez now i'm going to play my real openings i mean because this these guys are serious uh so so i'm going to play my real openings okay so d6 is fine that is called the steinitz variation and white should not particularly change the way that i play uh we already know that well d6 creates a pin so from a logical perspective what would be a good way to exploit that pin would be to open up the position with what move we know that the right lopez there's two main ways to play we can play c3 to prepare d4 but the immediate d4 is also perfectly good and after e takes d4 knight takes d4 we exploit the fact that the knight can move now a very good move in this position is actually to take the knight this is a hard move to understand you guys might be like wait a minute isn't the whole the whole point to like leave the night there and after the game i'll explain the rationale behind this move basically this softens up the e5 pawn so uh it eventually if i play this correctly will force black into taking on d4 and yielding a lot of the center so i'm going to castle if he takes on e4 he opens up the e file and i'm going to get a big initiative uh once that bishop appears on e4 okay so i'm going to take it he does take anyway okay and how do we very simple move how do we attack this bishop and make a general improving move remember that we can take on e5 later to reclaim the pawn but we don't need to rush with that we play rookie one and now the thing is we're attacking this pawn and we're we're pinning him i feel like white is better here okay so we have several things that we can take it's like a buffet um what should we capture here what should we start by capturing and there are several possibilities but the e5 pawn isn't going anywhere because my advice to you guys see here i think a lot of you guys are falling into a slightly faulty pattern of thinking this is the pawn i actually want to capture because e5 is not going anywhere he is not going to play e takes d4 because that disastrously opens up the e file and so now we can play d takes e5 obviously i'm not going to take again because of the back rank mate but the reason why it is better here is because his pawn structure on the queen side is quite ruined and my pieces are very active but we have to be very careful about how we follow this up if we play bishop e3 mindlessly developing the bishop we allow rook b8 and he wins the b2 pawn so one possibility is to fianchetto with b3 but that weakens all of these dark squares i don't really want to do that the other thing that we can do in such positions is is of course just to move move the queen uh we're going to move it to a nice centralized location we are also threatening to take on e5 white is slightly better i'm not winning but i have a very pleasant position let's speed up our pace of play a little bit then we can develop our bishop and bring a rook into the game again i i hope that people are more or less understanding my play i'm not doing anything crazy okay so rook beat is a good move um if i guess what he's trying to do is bait me into taking the pawn what does black have in the event of queen takes e5 this pawn is actually kind of like an umbrella or it's a it's a barricade that is separating his pieces from from mine he's got bishop f6 and his bishop opens up the b coupon is lost i don't want to allow any of that so i actually well b3 he maybe has bishop to b4 and then bishop to c3 driving the bishop in so what i'm going to do here is go c3 i am going to control the b4 square so his row can't go there and i'm also going to reinforce the thread of queen takes e5 because once i take and he goes bishop f6 the bishop as we know is biting on granite yeah i'm not sure why he allows me to take but i'm just going to call his bluff here and now i'm just going to be up a pawn in the end game let's see if i can convert it into a win uh queen takes c5 this the queen d6 was a bad move because now he well he can't avoid the queen trait actually he can move his queen away but he doesn't uh so rook takes c5 rookie that's a good move he's he's heading for d1 and we need to be careful because if we move the bishop out once again he has bishop f6 uh the rook has to move and and then rook takes b2 comes with great effect so we shouldn't panic here we we simply need to target the cause of the threat right we can go king f1 that's a nice way to defend against rook d1 if rook d1 check we simply drop a rook back and we're going to do that anyway to stop rook t1 and we're fine for the time being what's challenging here about white's position is untangling our queen side if we untangle our queen side we are going to be not completely winning but we're going to be well on the way to winning the game so rook b1 is one idea to open up the bishop what is the problem with rook b1 yeah we should have gone rookie two we're actually going yeah bishop takes e3 so we're actually going to try rookie two here and the point of this is of course to bring the bishop out if he goes rookie one check which he should do but let's see if he finds this then i'm going to come back to e1 i'm just asking him to find this one move and then we repeat the position and i'm going to try to find an alternate method but right now he's not playing rook d1 so maybe he's hesitating for whatever reason if anything yeah he does go rook to d1 so we have to unfortunately repeat the position and um i'm going to show you a five-head idea if he drops his rook back which he probably will because training rooks is in white's favor we are up a pawn i'm going to show you guys prepare for a five-head idea oh he takes okay so that is a little bit odd to me what i think he's trying to do here is what he's trying to say is now i can't get the bishop out but what he has forgotten is that i now have a little piece called a king and the king can get stuff done it absolutely can get stuff done what do i mean by that how can it get stuff done where can the king go uh in the name of liberating the bishop from c1 the king of course goes to this nice little c2 square then the bishop comes out finally we can complete our development we can bring the rook out and we can convert our extra pawn we do not need to defend h2 because of the move g3 bobby fischer boris baskey but at the same time in okay we'll go rook to at some point i want to move that h-bond because i don't want to keep having to deal with this this is something that a lot of people don't understand like why are you defending the pawn if you just said he can't take it yes he can't take it but does it make sense that i don't want to have to deal with this all the time so now a4 what this move accomplishes is it fixes the weakness the pawn on a5 is on a dark square i want you guys to pay very careful attention to that and guess what he now allows us to exploit this weakness in textbook fashion what should we do should we take the rook and if we do take the rook why what will be our follow-up yeah of course we take the rook and we have bishop b6 that is why we played a4 the pawn is immobilized and he has a terrible choice he can go bishop c7 and the pawn end game is of course completely lost but so is the bishop end game i'm gonna be up two pawns both of them on the queen side of the game is over so he really collapsed here quite quickly um okay so takes on on a5 he's probably gonna go here and try to corner my bishop but the bishop has an escape route via b4 okay now uh the win is a very very simple matter of pushing pushing my pawns but uh you always hear the advice be patient in the end game what that really means is you want to make all the necessary improvements first what kind of improvement can you make before pushing the pawns so like yeah so let's bring the king out first so the king can supervise the progress of the pawns we don't need to worry about the king side because the pawns are symmetrical we need to watch for a pawn break but by and large we don't need to do anything now even we even here we can make an improvement before pushing the pawns up we can reposition this bishop to which square yeah bishop b4 bishop c5 is right bishop b4 bishop c5 is right and only then when all of these necessary improvements have been made did you guys not see me play bullet against min 30 seconds is an eternity folks you are in the hands of a professional everybody take a deep breath we are we will be just fine trust me on this one we will be just fine we go king c5 to force him to take the pawn then we are going to reposition our king to d5 and finally we are going to bring the other pawn up to c4 c5 c6 and we are going to win do not try this okay so i should have taken the pawn but it doesn't matter because everything is protected just don't pre-move we can actually pre-move c6 check because it is a check but that is the only thing we do not pre-move bc app or tampering with v6 and now we can transition into a pawn end game but first let's play b6 now it's important here to notice the bishop on f4 okay bishop c7 bc check and now we bring our king in and we are going to cause zugzwang and the game is over so f4 we can just immobilize his fonts first that's fine also okay check now what move should we make in this position how do we cop how do we force zooxvon what do we do okay we move the bishop yeah good job i just wanted one person to answer this now what i'm going to do is i'm going to move the bishop to g5 in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate that's actually a very important little trick right just make sure the bishop doesn't control any possible squares okay are you guys a little bit convinced that everything was under control yeah we're fine uh it it's cosmetically close but it really isn't close i i know how much time i need to and what you guys need to understand is i've played for so long that i know how much time i need to win these positions i know that i'm going to win this with an abundance of time on my clock i'm not trying to rub it in anyone's face okay so this was a rye lopez and the first kind of surprising move is bishop takes c6 right but i think it actually isn't as surprising as i'm making it out to be we are simply weakening the e5 pawn we're trying to get him to take on d4 which of course gives me a much better slice of the center okay and and this is just a super active position uh once he goes knight f6 you can get this bishop out to g5 white is slightly better that's just bottom line what we're aiming for here is a slightly better position oh my god and there we go jer jerky sminion with 20 are you kidding me in astral 96 throwing in a sub there my lands girl the 4 am hype is unreal 4 20 gifted sums by jerky simon kgb operative throwing in his sub as well and we are on the way back to magic thank you so much appreciate it jerky simon uh you're the man and and the damn girl also so thank you thank you appreciate it okay so uh once this happens he goes knight f6 and we castle does this part of the game make sense guys we're actually kind of semi sacrificing the fun for an initiative right we are pushing him around he's not developed so i know that i'm going to win back the pawn worst comes to worst this is not you know i'm not taking a big risk here or i'm sacrificing a pawn oh my god ruling snow i know that i'm going to win back e5 okay so bishop takes f3 queen takes f3 bishop b7 now a lot of you guys wanted to take on e5 and there is a well this might transpose into the game if he castles i can take on b7 this is literally the game position however there was a move that deterred me from playing d takes e5 specifically could anybody tell me what move i am referring to it's just a concrete thing right the move d5 and he intercepts my queen's access to b7 and he keeps the position closed we do not want the position to be closed because we have the initiative maybe i can play e6 here but um how can black respond to this position on the topic of not panicking keep a cool head when you see a move like this because sometimes you don't really have to do anything crazy at all thank you jared lefty look at these subs that's what we like to see we just castle because we simultaneously defend the pawn and black is completely fine here in fact black might be better after c6 okay so that's the reason i didn't play de i took on b7 and uh well e takes d4 is horrible for a variety of reasons um king russo asks what if he played f4 when the bishop was on e4 that's a great question if he had played f5 ding ding ding ding ding ding this sets the alarm bells off in my head because this weakens his king side even further and guess what he's not he hasn't developed his bishop so if i can get this bishop out of e4 then i'm gonna have a direct artery to his king that's not going to end well for for uh for black so knight g5 is a typical attacking move and um and now i can i can take on e5 and this just looks i mean this looks absolutely devastating um well quicker wrote in in which position can he take on d4 because his bishop is hanging here and here he's pinned so he he never could capture on d4 oh oh you mean here yeah so so this opens up the e5 i mean this move looks good um although he's got f6 there you can give a check force the king back i mean why can't just do nothing at all just develop his pieces and i've got full compensation thank you derpy ebola for the tier one okay whoops sorry my bad so he castles we take and we drop the queen back to e4 okay we drop the queen back to e4 centralizing it getting it out of the line of fire of the rook and now uh the calm stage of the game we go c3 uh in order to protect the b4 square and the d4 square this pawn is is kind of a nice nice little pawn and the follow-up move would have probably been to play b3 and then developing the bishop so queen d6 is a big mistake he just i think he forgot the pawn was hanging he should have defended it he should have played bishop f6 or whatever bishop d6 he should have defended the pawn and then he makes another mistake by trading queens black is a very clever way of avoiding the queen trade here who can tell me what it is i mentioned it during the game but i didn't say a specific move the way that you need to find this specific move is once again to realize that when the bishop is on c1 white needs to worry about the back rank okay um and what that means is you could also think of the rook on e1 being a type 2 undefended piece so the queen could just slide on over to c6 in fact even queen d7 is good and that's a vicious trap because after rookie a black wins the queen you cannot move the queen due to back rank checkmate that is why um if you have a chance to play a move like h3 in certain positions that's a good idea because of tactics like these does that make sense so he should have at least kept the queens on the board so takes takes this uh brings the game into an end game we go king f1 to prepare rookie one against rook d1 um now the five head move if he didn't trade brooks okay so let's say that he would have brought his rook back to d8 repeating the position let me guide you guys through i'm not saying this is an amazing move i'm just saying it's a nice idea it's an elegant idea now the bottom line is i want to move the bishop out fact one let's bring everybody on board with the fact that we want to bring does that make sense the reason i want to bring the bishop out is because i need to complete my development to win this game now we have already determined that defending the pawn on b2 opens up another tactic with bishop takes c3 and you cannot move the bishop out directly because you drop b2 and then you drop c3 etc so the question i ask myself is do i have any other methods of defending the b2 pawn so that i can bring the bishop out we already know that rookie 2 has been tried and it failed to the check so that's where this idea comes from you just need to apply some creativity thong me look at you okay who else can find well king e2 the problem is the king can't walk to c2 because there's a force field on the d file b3 doesn't work because it drops c3 a4 is the correct move but the idea is to put the rook on a2 that is the ultimate idea rook a2 in order to liberate the bishop okay you can put the rook on a2 now isn't the rook passive there i hear you guys a little cringe horrible temporarily the rook's not going to stay on a2 eventually i'm going to find a way to once the bishop moves out i'm going to have the resources necessary to somehow defend the pawn again and then free up the rook but it's all about the priorities here it's okay to make an ugly looking move as long as you are fulfilling a priority well a4 gives the rook a little bit more space maybe you'll need the a3 square that's all there is to it okay um so that's the bottom line idea i can swear i saw a game like this um i can swear that i saw a a uh a game like this before and in general um this notion of of defending something uh in order to in order to move a piece out of the way is a a relatively common trope actually oh i do remember the game let me just find the game that i'm referencing here i recently gave uh to my students a problem it's it's a completely different position but it's a similar concept that i think some of you guys should file away in your sort of um mental rolodex of positional ideas the notion of wanting to play a move and not being able to play it because something is going to be hanging right some pawn is going to be left hanging for example and so you simply um you make a contract with one of your pieces and you say look peace look rook look knight i am going to force you to do something unglamorous but i promise um eventually you're going to be freed from this task once we do what we need to do okay here's a good example of that and this this dovetails back into another concept of static versus dynamic uh concepts in chess something that is dynamic is temporary and likely to change something that is static is likely to stay the same piece placement is generally quite dynamic you can change the way a piece uh sits on the board pretty quickly so you don't need to worry about a piece being passive uh for a short duration of time that's that's that's okay okay so this position right anderson against vagany and anderson one of the strongest positional players of all time now when we look at this position who is better and why uh we are looking at it from white's perspective so well white is better why is white better what are the weaknesses of black's position simple question i'm not looking for any any rocket science answers just look at the position i'm looking for two things very specifically and you guys got one after the other so the d5 hole and as so often happens the d6 pawn is also weak backward pawn and the space in front of it now there is a problem we have a way to occupy this square and that is to play knight d5 how should we attack this one if we wanted to attack the pawn on d6 what seems to be a pretty obvious way to immediately threaten that pawn well e5 just blunders the pawn yeah knight b5 bishop f4 blunt is the bishop knight controls the square knight b5 there is a problem with both of these moves both the moves knight b5 and knight d5 run into the same problem what is that problem not a hard question guys just look at the position yeah b2 is hanging and so anderson said aha okay wait a second i need to defend b2 but wait whoa whoa i know a lot of you are going to start thinking b3 this is the 2200 move b3 is a good move but that's not the grand master old anderson move the grand master move is while you are at it you prepare another idea and the move beautiful rook c2 rook c2 is a very strong positional move why is it so good because you're simultaneously defending the pawn of two and you are also preparing to move the rook onto d2 not insane but very nice idea and the funny thing is uh vaganyon played a6 to stop knight b5 anderson played rook d2 and vaganyan played knight d4 to plug the hole on the defile and anderson actually just sacks the exchange because he's got a pawn for the exchange and this pawn is going to fall it falls on the next move he's got two puns for the exchange and the knight comes into d5 white's got a massive position and you won the game in the end okay so a couple of lessons here and and the second among them is that when you have an idea you want to try to find the best execution for it the best execution often involves preparing with the prophylactic move also an active idea um would you be worried about bishop c3 no because that gives away the fiance bishop and the pawn on c3 a great example of double pawns being good covers the d4 square so literally you cannot defend d6 you're just busted here does that make sense uh so that's an echo of the concept we applied in in in the speedrun game of course completely different but hopefully you can see the similarity um okay so he he goes he he took the rook which is just bad and now we get the king to c2 same idea free up the bishop and the rest is very simple i mean he shouldn't have gone rook d7 that accelerates his defeat completely overblown if he did not go rook d7 what would be the plan of victory in this position and we have discussed this time and time again in these kinds of end games we simply need to identify uh the potential to create a past pawn and then we need to find the best way to do it we have two good ways to create this past fun the best well bishop d4 i'm actually not a huge fan of because this bishop on e3 guys is a huge asset this bishop on e3 could not only help create a past pawn but it could also help attack this pawn so i like bishop c5 to prepare b4 also this bishop paves the way for the pawn because once the pawn reaches a6 hey bishop's going to cover that a7 square and we're going to be able to play a 7. trading more pieces is not always good that is the point i have made from the very beginning of my speed run the fact that um the fact that okay when you're up a pawn or up a piece most trades are going to be good but once you've traded down to an end game do not just blindly continue to continue to trade um you see what i'm saying here peace can often be super valuable okay um and after rook d7 we take we win the pawn and the game is over if he he had done bishop c7 then we've simply take and go before completely winning pawn end game any questions about this game we played many more moves but he could have resigned here we made all of oh that's from goodwill honda we we made all of the necessary improvements and we pushed the pawn how about them apples okay eugene looks like what is the best defense against the rue lopez yeah the berlin is good a6 is the main move and then you get the main line with knight f6 and bishop b7 that's sort of the i've won about when he brought the rook to absolutely mr boyd i'm all ears mr boyd he brought the rook down in this position i mean he brought the rook down several times i assume you mean here uh what's the question oh there we go could he have brought the other rook oh could he have brought the other rook to defend yes he could have that's not a bad move but the thing is i can just move my bishop out and the rook on d1 is now under fire from both rooks which means that he must now either or get off the pot both of which are perfectly good scenarios uh if he takes the rook then we do what we want if he moves the rook away then that's that's great as well i think that's a good expression to capture to capture the situation blackstroke is in um anyways [Music]
