[Music] all right omar atef okay let's go e4 guys this is all going on youtube in fact several videos are out already all right we're gonna go knight f3 and we have been playing the italian which is which is an opening that emphasizes classical principles that's why i'm playing it d6 now we have already faced this move and you guys those of you who remember what do we do here what have we decided to do here to control the center what have we decided to do to control the center not d4 immediately we want to prepare d4 d4 is a good move but we want to prepare it how do we prepare d4 how do we prepare e4 yeah we want to go c3 d4 is fine but we like to occupy the center with our pawns now also it um it poses it remember in a previous game we played the move queen b3 so when he gets his bishop out of c8 if you've seen the morphe opera game you know that these pawns okay so the previous guy did the same thing we take it ruining his structure in front of his king queen b3 by the way is a fork but it's not a good one because black has queen c8 so let's just go d4 let's not do anything crazy he takes we take we have a beautiful center he has a weak king we have an advantage he goes e5 all right now according to our principle that we have formulated and this gets a little bit complicated do we want to close the center are we closing the center based on our discussion two games ago actually we do not well we can closing the center i would probably play and after the game i will show why but this game let's practice keeping the center open so let's just develop our pieces we can close the center which is an exception to the rule but here we're going to keep it open just to practice playing with an open center which you guys actually need more of don't worry i will explain exactly why we could have closed the center after the game now we take with the queen my guess is a lot of people go c5 in a position like this a lot of people not realizing that they're weakening the square i can guarantee you probably 50 of players like him will go c5 no he goes knight f6 what do we do broken monitor thank you so much what do we do we castle nothing to invent here we castle we don't need to so eve morgan i'll explain e5 in a moment thank you shaq why not so he's making a very classic mistake he's trying to intimidate us by putting a knight on a square where it's not actually doing anything thank you kit for the sub what do we do do we respond do we react or do we just keep developing we can chase the knight away with h3 but i want to show you guys that we can completely ignore and we don't have to do anything just keep developing let's keep developing bishop f4 also this supports the bond so the queen h4 doesn't does no longer come with a maid threat let's keep that train rolling loving loving it guys thank you for the support we don't react now in addition to just moving the same piece twice okay and as soon as we do nothing what do we do now do we move the bishop do we reactively move the bishop or do we apply the principle every time a pawn is moved we try to understand what weaknesses have been left behind thank you thank you for the rook thank you for the pawn and in addition his knight is now undefended his king is wide open boom boom fork knight undefended wide open rook i only have a knife do i even have a fork basic i'm super basic i don't even have a fork i just have knives and spoons but you get the point we need to think about forks do we have a fork do we have a fork we do but not here since the queen goes to that square boom boom boom the queen son of john won another sub thank you so much man thank you keep it rolling all right we win the piece okay ratings are refunded just reminding you guys yeah bore 3d of you queen g5 would have been better because it would have covered both potential forkable squares he could have also dropped his knight onto a defended square he's obviously still completely lost because he's down a million pieces i should not pre-move queen takes g4 because maybe he'll go queen g6 hoping for that pre-move he'll play king e7 and after king e7 we apply another principle never play a single move automatically unless it is literally the only move that is forced always take a moment to search for better moves and you guys are amazing knight d5 check would be a fork and a much greater fork after king e7 so his only moves are king d8 and king d7 and he maybe should block the queen okay so he's busted lenser with 500 bits that's right amazing and oh my god and we gotta stop sir t bone subscribing with prime holy smokes you guys i'm loving this i am loving this he's stalling that's okay that's okay in the meantime wasting no time jose src subscribing with twitch prime he's disconnected so i think he is not very happy our accuracy level so far in these games has been pretty high and he he whoa oh my god g cook 17 29.5 gifted oh my god oh my god guys sorry i'm screaming but i'm excited skirmish just gifted 10. holy smokes what is going on here we have an explosion g cook 1729 then skirmin 10 gifted subs to puddi chulu loves you so wild it's kuala null i am scrabby and gm donald trump i joined only because of oh my lands oh my lens this is ridiculous okay guys the energy has arrived i can even extend the stream we got wawa sc gifting we got tbj with the sub gsw 2017 go warriors with five more subs and curious chimpanzee with 200 bits oh my god i can't even talk about the game stop it you guys aren't letting me talk about the game right now oh my lance this is this is an overwhelming oh my goodness we're almost at 2 000. jacobs123 a sub to nick richardson okay but let's talk about the game thank you guys so much i really agree this is amazing raider raider rampage priming twitch prime and this is percolating we're going crazy okay so of course of course thank you guys this would not be possible without this kind of support so um the you know the credit belongs to you guys thank you so much all right so the move d6 we have already discussed is bad because it doesn't develop anything and it obstructs the development of the bishop as we have talked about the main moves here our bishop c5 and knight f6 there's also the hungarian variation bishop e7 which is reasonable it's a little bit passive but i have played this move myself thank you guys this is you're making me blush so d63 and bishop b6 we've already had this the last guy please help me with this with a with a sub thank you for the three months the last guy played d5 which is actually a very reasonable move this guy takes the pawn and we take back now we get the c3 square for the knight and he goes e5 this is the main moment in the whole game let's talk a little bit about how i decided not to close the center as a matter of fact both moves are very very good it would have been a great idea to close the center now bishop g4 where bishop g4 can somebody who is paying very careful attention to the ideas white has in this position tell me what white does here what does white actually do here and this is an idea that we've already seen before that i actually mentioned in this game i already mentioned this this in this game yeah queen b3 is right so queen b3 is correct um because i'm i'm very happy to hear that super duper shiny yeah queen b3 is right it's too early to take on f7 but the move queen b3 has the same idea now we're preparing to take on f and if white black takes on f3 i mentioned this previously we have this checkmating mechanism that people should remember black does not have any way to guard both pawns at the same time in morphe's opera game which is quite possibly the most famous and the most overrated game of all time we have seen uh that sorry morphe went d e we saw that morphe did something very very similar he forks the pawn in the pawn and um that basically was how the opera game started it's it's exactly the same idea okay so he goes to edd5 now d5 now we have discussed the principle that when we have a lead in development and when we have when your opponent is a weak king it is usually not a good idea to close the center because we make it harder for ourselves to access his king we make it harder for ourselves to take advantage of our leading developments but the reality is that here specifically we have a maneuver that is so strong that it actually justifies it justifies us closing the center and it is only because of this maneuver being possible that it is fine to close the center as well so it's a very concrete moment could somebody spot what i'm talking about here bingo potato for president you deserve a sub my man lord adamson knight you 5 look at this look at this look at this knight this outpost and that's why you need to be very attentive to outposts is going to be a monster it is literally look at this monstrosity on e6 it's not letting black castle either way black literally is paralyzed now we're gonna go bishop g5 and we're gonna open up that f-file and crash through and check my plaque so actually this is probably white's best move now if you are on the receiving end of such a situation let's look for let's say you're playing black damn you allowed a outpost like this to happen by accident is there anything that you can do and be sharky comment to play with a thousand thank you so much np sharky what do you do is it completely lost you can use what we discussed undermining you could play c6 and you can try to undermine the base of the outpost it doesn't actually solve black's problems because here white can kind of ignore him and the pawn is a little bit weaker though so this gets a little bit complicated but if you are on the receiving end of an outpost see if you can undermine the piece or the pawn that is holding the outpost that is defending it okay in order to try to get out of the situation thank you sufultra for gifting to patel for president appreciate it okay back to reality we decided to keep the center open just to practice playing in these kinds of positions um okay so for those of you who are wondering can black take the pawn you actually cannot this is a good tactical idea but it doesn't work because after knight takes d5 if we take thank you twit max if we take knight 65 then queen takes d5 if we take queen takes e6 then fork fork for a fork this is a family fork and we win the queen so this is a little bit of calculation but the knight is retained on e6 okay so knight c3 is the move and so he takes d4 knight takes d4 knight 64 queen takes d4 just to remind you guys the move c5 would have made things even worse because it would have weakened the square and i want to use this because we only have time maybe for one last one after this to introduce to you the concept of weak squares i want to talk a little bit about positional chess and make a small detour how do we exploit the weakness of the d5 square do we put a knight on d5 immediately could somebody tell me the plan and why is knight d5 immediately a bad idea it's a bad idea because we want a knight on d5 we don't want to trade pieces on d5 we want the knight to be on d5 all alone the merciful sermon beautiful bishop g5 take the knight and stick this beauty on d5 you can castle first too you might ask me how did i know to do that where am i pulling this line up well guess what when i was about seven or eight every single russian schoolboy is always shown a game uh that is a very classical game which features precisely this planet is a game between smithslav former world champion soviet union and rutakovsky a master it is a game played in 1945 and it is a game precisely in which this plan was applied by smithslav this position occurred on the board what do you think smithslav did here what do you think smithslav did here can he play an it5 no he can't that's terrible but what do you do boom boom boom and that wins the game because this knight is so strong black can take the pawn but here smith's love can deliver a fork there's a little tactical justification basically that is what's missed loved it everybody has shown this game you guys might be like daniel has this ever happened to you have i ever allowed a knight on t5 uh have i ever allowed a knight to come to d5 and gotten crushed i absolutely have i absolutely have and let me show you guys a good example of that let me show you guys a good example of that i know the cursors go crazy here but i will i will flip the game in a moment got a kamsky one of the most legendary players of all time literally a famous fn legend this is my game against kamsky from the u.s championship 2017. i played a ray lopez and guess what happened to me what has got to do in this position bishop g5 now he gets his knight around he takes any and and he tr look at you have the components of that plan boom boom boom okay so it's happened to me and i got crushed and this plan is one of the most classical plans in a lot of different positions the outpost specifically on d5 is one that you have to look for and remember the plan of getting rid of the knight on f6 or whatever is guarding the outpost and then sticking the knight on the outpost so i have plenty of games to show you that that's not the only time that this has happened i have games on the opposite side where i have been the one um you know basically sticking pieces on really really good outpost thank you lindsay for your support really appreciate it yeah and i'm finishing up in five minutes anyway okay so for that reason this was bad for black let's go back to the speed run and uh just the last couple of things basically um after bishop f4 g5 queen takes him i mean he blunders a a rook but it doesn't matter he's already in huge trouble because because he cannot get his bishop out and queen takes g7 is coming in and the game is over okay so that is just i mean this is just terrible for black and my plan here is perhaps to stick the knight on d5 or open up the center there's a bunch of things that white can do here to end the game and the rest is very simple here he loses his his knight and the game is over guys yes this will be uploaded i am already uploading um my editor has already uploaded big shout out to him the first three parts of the speed run um broken down into into bite-sized portions going forward the segments are going to be 30 to 45 minutes long because otherwise the speed run is going to be a very very long one otherwise we're going to have 800 parts i don't want to do that but the first three segments the first three games have been uploaded to youtube loving the support on twitch but if you want to subscribe to youtube i try to upload as much content as possible and uh i would really really appreciate it thank you guys so very much for all the hype okay i got time for one last game one last game and then we're gonna go over it and wrap up okay ready guys no i am just a mere mortal figuring things out just like everybody okay i happen to be very passionate about this but you guys make it possible so let's go e4 let's actually let's go d4 let's go d4 and i'm gonna play something a little bit different okay whoa and it's paying off already it's paying off already whoa okay so i have a funny move here i have a funny move here i have no idea what this guy is doing i actually can not move yeah i can play for i can play e4 oh my god jeez relax what can i do now this guy's going to get what he's what he's looking for this guy is going to get exactly what he's looking for how do i attack the spawn how do i attack this yeah i should be too i don't know what he's doing but he's landing himself in a little bit of trouble this guy's landing himself in a little bit of trouble and if he takes my bishop i take on h5 and this is checkmate in two moves yeah now watch him start playing really well this is like a gambit that he's analyzed you know for many many years but again okay so he he actually stops mate but we can still take the pun we're up two pawns and we're getting his king out into the open i mean could you possibly ask for more out of five moves what do we do now what do we do now and you got to be careful guys where do we move the bishop be careful because remember he wants to take on d4 and if we take back with the queen the bishop on h5 is going to be lost so we need to move the bishop on e3 to lend another protector for the pawn on d4 there's no reason it wouldn't be a disaster to get that pawn up but why why should we so we prepared to recapture and deform the bishop that's that's basically the idea here okay that is basically the idea here and then we basically take one to four yeah okay go to z6 um there are several approaches here and i'm going to make a move that looks very lit well actually no let's develop a piece that we know we want to develop what should we develop and be careful please because the move knight f3 would be a blunder we want to go knight c3 because now we're actually threatening knight c5 that's almost checkmate so this is going to be fun the move that i thought about playing and we're actually going to play this move here here's the thing guys i want to develop this knight but this bishop is a pain in the neck right now can we get this bishop somewhere safe so that we can complete our development there are several possibilities so we can try to trade this bishop we can get it back what can we do can you give me one move yeah there should be two so i'm gonna go bishop e2 to illustrate that sometimes it's okay to have a bishop on e2 yes the bishop is not super active but we have extra two pawns he has a king on e7 it's totally fine for one of one or more of your pieces to be on a quiet passive square provided that you have a good reason to put it there okay bishop h6 no reason not to trade let's take it and let's continue our development after that with knight f3 yeah let's just continue our development now think about which side you want to cast on which side do you think white should castle this is actually a really instructive question that is going to be important to as well remember he no longer has these two pawns which means that if we were to castle king's side he would be ready made to start attacking we would justify his strategy we would castle long so let's prepare it again we ignore the knight most people would go h3 here but i want to and so would i but i want to emphasize that a knight on g4 doesn't actually always do anything but we don't want to castle long just yet because we would drop the pawn on f2 with a fork so before we cast along we do want to get rid of the night but only because we're preparing to castle only because we're preparing to castle um not because that night is actually doing anything so let's get rid of the night are we threatening to capture the night are we threatening to capture the night here well we actually were not but we would have moved the rook away now we're ready to cast along we actually aren't but we would have moved the rook away and then we would have been threatening to capture the night yeah we can actually take this night that's also possible but remember what i tell you guys it's less important to ruin his fond structure it's more important to ruin the structure around his king okay let's get this out of here even though it's not doing anything there so bishop takes a6 doesn't actually ruin the structure around his king i would not actually do that because it also opens up the b file it helps him attack what do we do in such positions the time has come to open the center do we have a way to open the center guys we don't we don't even need g4g5 we have a ready-made way to open the center nope guys don't play d5 that is exactly what you want to avoid here just take the pawn just take the pawn open the d-file take the pawn open up the center and we have already born the fruits of it now he's taking f65 we ask ourselves immediately what are the drawbacks of the move he has weakened the square let's find a tactic together what is this called guys and i told you guys to pay attention to this what is this called the rook and the queen are in what relationship an x-ray what do we look for when we have an x-ray we look for a discovery if we move this queen away and if this pawn were gone from d6 we would be winning his queen so what move can we make to make both of these things happen what is the tactic bingo knight takes e5 if d takes e5 we just give a check that's it we want to screen that's the importance of paying attention to these tactics and the game is over the game is literally over because not only does he lose his queen it gets checkmated while he is at it i'm not trying to pretend that it is easy to find tactics of all kinds but when you are aware when you are tactically aware it becomes a lot easier to spot these hidden tactics that is one of the drawbacks of solving puzzles you know that there is a tactic trivia question we have checkmate in two moves we actually can make a move before taking the queen that leads to checkmate and two find it what is the move no we can take the queen and the rook normally i would propose for that to happen but check let's get a piece on f7 to block the king's escape and now this is checkmate we could have also taken the pinch very quickly because i have to go in three minutes let's analyze okay g5 is obviously terrible it's also terrible after e4 i have faced the move once and i'll talk later about it um i'll talk later about it i'm just going to write this down but um we didn't do anything extraordinary the movie 4 is very nice because we prepare to give checkmate okay so this is all very very simple bishop e2 we are threatening to take on h5 with checkmate and the key moment in the game that i want you guys to pay very careful attention to the move this should be two it doesn't look like anything but it's actually a very important move we the bishop has done its job we drop it back to prepare the continued development we bring all our pieces out we don't do anything crazy we don't go g4 we simply develop we castle long in order to not give him an attack had he done something like this we could have just moved our rook out of the way and in addition to in addition to just is there doing anything here or is it just staring at the pawn hint it's actually doing something on g1 what is it doing it is not actually staring at the pawn it might supervise a potential g4 but didn't you say daniel that you shouldn't do this i'm not saying that i'm just saying d take c5 is a simpler way to open the center but if we do choose to pawn storm we might have a rook poised to exploit the opening of the file okay instead he does our work for us we get the night out d takes e5 and here already at this point as soon as we castle i am already noticing the x-ray and by noticing the x-ray it becomes a lot easier to find a tactic like this because we simply apply the logical steps to make this x-ray into a discover check what do we need we need to get rid of the spawn distract it we need to get rid of the screen the best way to get rid of one of our own pieces is to do so with check we have a check and we have a way to get rid of his pawn he shouldn't have taken the knight but it wouldn't have mattered and now we find the best move simple effective unoriginal we just do stuff that we know to do we develop our pieces measured solid thought through chest no drastic movements that is how you beat offbeat openings
