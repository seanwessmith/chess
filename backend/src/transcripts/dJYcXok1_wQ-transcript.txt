that is crazy bruh [Music] so we're going to play the king's indian we're going to play the kings indian which we've been kind of focused on throughout the speedrun because it's the opening that i play i also think it's a very instructive opening and um i i hopefully have done a halfway good job of explaining the sort of basic tenets of the king's indian now do you guys remember what the what the main move here is this looks like a blunder of a pawn but as i've explained previously this actually is the main move it does not blunder upon because there's a tactical reason behind it the move is e5 let's hope he doesn't take um i i don't like playing against the exchange now i'm going to go for a structure that i have gone for before i'm going to take on d4 and the way to understand this is i've explained previously right white's got the space advantage what white's got this bind on my center but i have the ability to immediately and frontally attack white spawns how and i also have a secondary ability and the secondary ability is to prepare a pawn breakthrough so this is kind of like the morocci vine it's not literally the morose bite it's kind of like the merotzy mind now what pawn breakthrough can i prepare and how can i prepare it it's when you when you scour the board for breakthroughs you you should see the d5 is the idea that we want to prepare but we can't go d5 immediately that obviously blotters upon so we just prepare it with c6 yeah that's all there is to it this is the theory yep so d5 he takes and goes c5 that's the theoretical line let's see if he knows it he does a c5 is the move and now we simply want to develop our knight this is still theory as far as i remember now after he castles we want to increase the pressure on this knight right we have our knight pressuring his knight and we actually want to make him take our knight i'll explain that after the game uh and i'll explain the point of c5 as well um but how do we increase the pressure on his knight how do we turn that volume dial up up um knight h5 yeah well it's not crazy right knight h5 attacks the knight on d4 and where can this knight potentially go well this knight can potentially go to f4 which is a really nice square right so you're killing two birds with one stone and i like these positions knight b5 is i think the best move so actually let's go knight f4 i don't see a reason not to and now we can continue increasing the pressure on the king's side how how can we continue increasing the king side pressure so we have our knight here it's it's already sort of pressuring g2 and now we can try to go queen g5 and really turn the heat up on the king side i don't see a reason not to do that uh and you know black is already white is already in trouble i think because we're threatening checkmate we're also threatening a potential check on h3 people should see that because the pawn is pinned to the king and uh he's got a lot to take care of here okay so what should which of the moves should we play here we obviously can't jump over the pawn and deliver the checkmate but a move like g3 should set your alarm bells ringing immediately because um because it creates so many weaknesses on the king side now should we take the bishop should we take the bishop we okay again i i trick a lot of people by asking that but we absolutely should because by taking the bishop we are creating very big weaknesses in his position in particular you guys should notice uh this e3 square let's take on z4 once simplifying the position and now we win the game with what move yeah we win the game with queen e3 because we simply win the night and not only do we win the night we can take it with the bishop or the queen all right we're going to take it with the bishop because we're also paving the way for the queen to come to f2 with absolutely devastating effect that is the power of the king's indian when it is played well okay so that is a relatively good king's indian win now he played what's called the glitterage system that's bishop e3 and um f3 c6 now another good reason that we play c6 is that this bishop on e3 is undefended so if he castles then uh then we play d5 and he can't take on d5 with this pawn because the bishop hangs and if he takes with the c pawn then we actually can play knight takes c5 this is my game against robert hess from 2012 over the board this is a line and this is very bad for white for basically the same reason as in the game his knight on d4 loses its support and this just looks pretty darn ugly for white so he goes bishop f2 which is the correct move he drops the bishop away from the square where it was x-rayed by the rook d5 takes take c final what is the point of c5 the point of c5 is essentially to keep the position closed down number one and also this knight on d4 remains sort of robust as a blockader if you don't play c5 let's say if you just castle then black has the potential of opening the position up and when the position opens up the knight on d4 kind of loses its value the knight on d4 its value comes from the fact that it blockades the pawn on d5 if this pawn is gone then the knight is just sort of another piece if that makes sense so knight c6 is correct castles and now knight h1 now here's the moment where he went wrong um and actually no no here is the motor actually the move is not to castle and in this position he has to well actually he has to stop knight f4 if he lets me go knight f4 that knight is devastating because it pressures the bishop it creates the possibility of queen g5 there's just too much stuff that that goes on there so how does he stop knight f4 but without weakening his position you don't want to go here you do not want to go here because that weakens so many of these squares around the king side what should white do here instead queen d2 is correct nice job orange queen d2 is absolutely right good job now bishop a lot of your bishop e3 blunders the bishop bishop g3 remember there's a knight on d4 that blood is the knight so you you you have to keep the bishop here where it controls the knight there's a lot to take care of here we need to is the move so knight cb5 he's just underestimating the danger and at this point he's already in big trouble he's already in big trouble because this is not easy to defend against it's very much not easy to defend against and again if he plays a move like bishop g3 and he says get out of here then you you might notice that the knight on d4 is not under protection what does black do in this position to win the game what does black do in this position in the game you notice that the knight guards the bishop but the great thing about the king's indian bishop the knight can be captured you take the knight here not the bishop but the knight because the bishop on e2 loses its support and you can potentially also lose your queen so that just is game over rookie one queen g5 and he's already busted uh if he plays bishop f1 then we go knight h3 and knight takes f2 and we win the queen so i don't see a defense for him at this point literally everything loses here so this is why why these positions are so fun i mean they're open and and everything seems to win so it's very hard to play this with white unless white is extremely well prepared that's why you want to be careful about which positions you go into yeah that's all there is to it so well h4 doesn't okay so h4 in this position what would get me cautious about this move or sorry not not in this position but in this position wait in which position i'm not sure which position you're referring to so oh why do we want him to take so if he takes on c6 if he takes on c6 the reason this is good for black there's two main reasons this trade is good for blind when you are evaluating traits uh don't overthink it you have to compare it before and after you know those commercials before and after hair treatment you know before they and it always looks like it's a different person like literally the person before is the most miserable human being on earth and then after he's like the ceo of 18 companies but you got to do the same thing um it strengthens the center right there's a pawn that appeared on c6 there's a pawn on d5 that pawn is passed and now it is a protected passed lawn protected passports are good the other thing it does is opens up the b file who does the b file benefit well it benefits the side that can occupy it and exert pressure down the people can white exert pressure down the b file no obviously there's a pawn on b2 this is why it's called a semi-open file because only one side can benefit from that file that would be black you can put a rook on v8 and exert pressure on b2 that's all there is to it right uh that's why we want them to take we still want them to take that would be the same exact thing basically um yeah i know there's a lot of question well knight c2 doesn't actually help prevent knight f4 well the light squared bishop is sort of held in reserve yeah knight h5 is very very common idea in the king's indian um why didn't you want him to take in the beginning well i just don't like playing against the exchange variation the exchange variation forces an endgame exchange variation forces an endgame and that's a very early stage to force in that game i remind you guys that if flight takes on e5 with the pawn with the knight then we should notice that the bishop is x-raying this knight the knight is undefended knight takes e4 wins back the pawn with interest and uh black is actually slightly better in this position without this the king's indian literally would not work at all so this this is like important okay all right um so that's that game any questions any last questions okay let's play one last one and then i might call it a knight really appreciate everybody's support of course okay let's go e4 this time let's go e4 this time and a karo khan so the line that i've been playing almost exclusively let's play the narrow con queen f3 is the nereidski card gun this is an opening that i have been playing almost exclusively um against the car con for like a year in blitz and um it's an opening that contains a lot of traps and one of them actually happens here we don't actually move the knight so white black attacks tonight what does white do here to not move the knight like what other move does white have here yeah it's bishop c4 so you attack f7 and knight f6 is a mistake here knight f6 in this position is a mistake he's got to play e6 and he actually plays it correctly now we go back to e2 basically we get this really interesting pawn structure right where okay it's like this pawn structure occurs in other openings but what we're basically going to try to do is we're going to shift this queen why are we going to shift the screen because we need to develop the knight and we want to develop the knight to f3 so that it attacks d4 where do you guys think we should put our queen on f3 like what would be a nice spot to park it on so d3 is kind of awkward because then we would not be able to develop this bishop okay i know you guys are thinking about attacking the pawn but remember black can just play c5 and he can easily defend the pawn in fact he does exactly that um so in fact i'm actually going to play the move d3 first yeah queen g3 queen g3 is where we want to park our queen so that it exerts pressure on the pawn the bishop on f8 cannot move um and he's got to play the move g6 in order to liberate the bishop and that's kind of a weakening move then we can play the move knight f3 now what move can we play first before playing knight f3 if we wanted to grab some more space on the queen side what move yeah so we could consider playing f4 now the drawback of that move is that it would kind of block in the bishop and in this game in this game um but on the other hand it would really help us expand on the queen sides king side so let's procrastinate let's procrastinate let's first develop our bishop let's see where he puts his knight and if he puts his knight on g6 okay let's go f4 why not let's go four and then we're gonna develop the knight behind the pawn of course he can trade queens with queen h4 but i don't really mind an end game here we've got more space white is okay so you guys have five now the obvious immediate question we ask ourselves when we face a move like this is do we need to react to this do is he actually threatening anything specific and do we benefit from taking on f5 we actually kind of do and i want somebody to tell me in what way we benefit from taking on f5 this is a subtle observation now the way that we benefit from taking on f5 is that he will not be able to castle he will not yes so not only do we open the e file and we're going to castle and quickly put a rook anyone but he will not be able to castle uh even if he gets his bishop out this bishop as long as the bishop is on c4 it covers the castle square he can try to castle long but he's a long way away from doing that because he hasn't developed the c8 bishop yet okay so let's let's bring our knight out first and then we're going to very quickly put a rook on e1 and maybe knight g5 comes i'm telling you this line of the karo khan is super dangerous and okay obviously let's get our rook over to e1 okay whoa and now what what do we do now now the attack literally plays itself we consult all of our pieces okay which pieces can we activate and we see a very simple move knight g5 of course getting to f7 if he goes rook cafe then knight takes h7 wins the game and he just resigns this is over i mean that f7 is a totally devastating threat and uh that is why this line is very dangerous there's a lot of traps like this in the narrow con um and i don't like playing it because the emphasis of the speedrun is not on winning with traps but it's actually kind of a legitimate opening it's been adopted by a lot of other gm's i think it's called a goldman variation formally so queen f3 now the move queen f3 let me tell you a little bit about its history um this is a very unorthodox move obviously because uh the knight belongs on f3 you're literally putting the queen on a square where the knight belongs it's gotten very popular recently it was played by vasily smith love world champion from the soviet union for the first time in 1950 so russians were the first like five or six people to actually play this line uh which is kind of cool i guess it's uh symbolic right 1950 smith's love against floor uh floor was uh oh it was played in the candidates tournament so it was played in a really high stakes event for the first time by vasily smith these guys are pretty good now what is the main trap of this line the main trap black plays knight f6 most of the time here while this is not a mistake it actually can lead to very quick victory i have won me i've been moro with this line what i'm about to show you and i have beaten countless players with this line here you go e5 the knight drops back to d7 okay white needs to defend this pawn how does white defend this pawn well obviously well 96 because then he just takes e6 is interesting but d4 now what is the usual way in which black undermines this pawn chain like how in the french how do you guys you guys know this move right how ryan khc priming thank you c5 c5 but but but he can't believe c5 yet did it he can't play c5 yet because the pawn on t5 will hang so e6 is what everybody plays and now white makes a very innocent looking move knight h3 ah big deal c5 and people think that they're better here because normally in these positions white wants to play c3 and white wants to defend the pawn on d4 that's sort of standard practice but black is losing here losing knight g5 but white is winning because after queen e7 and do you guys want me to tell you how many times i have had this happen in my chess career i see my game against cecaro in the slime at the very least um so hikaru has fallen into this among other people because the move knight to b5 wins the game white is winning because there is no defense against these two threats there is simply no resources that black can allocate to defend against these two horrific horrific moves black loses a ton of pieces a lot of people go f6 here now you go knight c7 check king d8 knight g takes e6 check it's basically checkmate black has to give his queen up and the game is over so this line is one of the appeals of the of the narrow con but we can also see in uh this game does anybody want to venture a guess as to why knight f6 is actually inaccurate here this is really cool this is really really cool stuff yeah e5 now watch what happens e5 d takes e3 okay he takes the knight we take his knight you might look at this position and say well wait a second uh black can win a pawn black can win a pawn black can play c takes d2 check okay it's check we have to take and now black can play he takes f6 but look at the development that white has and white combines this development with castling and all of a sudden black is in huge trouble he's completely undeveloped his queen is under attack his king is on castles the bishop on c4 has ideas of sacrificing himself on f7 this is like incredibly hard to play for black black is already worse i had this happen in a processly game i botched it but i was basically winning right out of the opening and um this stuff is really dangerous so his move e6 is actually correct but my opponent went really wrong i think at at this point after he goes knight g6 i mean i think i would go g6 i think not developing this bishop for a very long period of time is not a good idea like you have to get take care of that bishop and uh then you have to castle quickly because the way that this happened when i played f4 and still bishop e7 here i would castle as quickly as possible the move f5 is a very serious misjudgment and i think i've explained sufficiently why this is a misjudgment the main reason is that even if black were to now develop his bishop it's too late he cannot castle literally it's illegal and the time that it takes to talk the king away on the queen side and it just doesn't come fast enough okay because i'm going to put my rook on e1 and i'm going to already be threatening like a discovered check that's totally devastating so this k-98 is kind of caught in the crossfire if that makes sense so that i mean you can see how quickly the attack proceeds and he resigns here because the threat of knight f7 is absolutely devastating and if black defends against it by putting a rook on a thing why what move does white play here i said this during the the game but who can remind me of the move i mean at like a 16 1700 level you can absolutely yeah boom boom there's no way to sustain everything okay well but i'm explaining that william he resigned because he has no way to defend against knight f7 that's literally why he resigned i'm not sure how else i could sort of explain it if you have a specific proposed move uh i'm happy to analyze it um you know what i'm saying but but otherwise i you know it's the fact that this threat is totally devastating and um there is no other defense well 96 doesn't win the queen right 96 bishop takes c6 so the specific threat here is specifically knight at night f7 okay kb7 i suppose might be the best move but now i can send you back with a check and um if you go to this side of the board then you walk right into the x-ray of the rook this is going to be devastating thank you flat dog 522 so this is crushing well that's what i'm explaining right bishop e6 here is crushing all of these squares are just weak there's too much attacking potential that white has he trusted that i was that i would be able to find these types of moves why can't queen take on f7 because the f7 square is protected by the bishop so in the event of let's say a random move then we just take the queen with our bishop we recapture it with our bishop okay um does that make sense could he have prevented him no literally he is losing at this point i think that his last chance to do something maybe at this position he could have probably gone i don't know king fa maybe but still knight g5 is really really devastating because this threat is horrible so yeah black has to castle asap uh it really doesn't matter which rook we use i just think this creates a more elegant effect well rook f8 we take on before again there's too many avenues of threats here you guys are defending against one and allowing another so yeah maybe queen e7 i don't want to get too detailed here but the bottom line is clearly white's got the big initiative clearly white's got the big initiative and it's it's incredibly hard to defend against this stuff if that makes sense all right i guess we can do one more i guess we can do one more okay matilda we're playing the same guy okay um let's play a sicilian let's go back to an accelerated dragon which oh my god proper 25 after everything that happened this morning wow thank you proper 25 holy smokes oh distracting me from the game i see what you're doing now i see what you're doing now damn girl now what what do we take the bishop with here and we actually have had a game like this before which way do we take the bishop we so actually most people think b takes but we actually take with the d pawn as i've explained previously and there are several reasons for this it's complicated but first of all we're opening the bishop and that's uh that's a pretty important thing also we're sort of increasing our control over the d file well thank you prophet you are very sweet and in order to increase our control over the d4 square specifically uh the move that we play here is e5 which is a move that confused a lot of people the last time we played it because it seems to block in the bishop and i totally get that uh but i'll sort of put this into context after the game remember the expression bad bishops defend good pawns that is a very important expression and that expression helps us understand why this move is justified so let's go a5 let's stop him from expanding on the queen side now we want to develop this knight to e7 we don't want to put it on f6 because that would just blunder the pawn okay so i'm going to do the same thing i did in the previous game we go queen to c7 to defend the pawn on e5 and this there's a certain kings indiana component to this game in that what is black's main idea here what is one of black's main ideas here how are we going to attack the king side okay b4 is actually a really really strong move yeah so we want to play f5 but i actually forgot about this idea he just uh well actually is it though okay so so there's some interesting stuff that happens so he breaks through with a5 um that's a pretty interesting idea i'm not sure how good it is i'm not sure how good it is i think it's actually really really good let me think um yeah so the thing is if we attack the knife we go b5 then he goes knight to b6 attacks the rook and then he wins c5 so let's actually take the pawn let's take the pawn and um black is probably worse here but it's not clear so now uh white is like not threatening anything horrible white has all of these little mini threats it would be too early to play f5 because our rooks are not connected and our bishop has not developed so let's develop our bishop and let's see how he plays this but basically we want to prioritize completing our development here because our position is kind of flimsy if that makes sense and so we need to complete the development as much as as much as possible thanks again prophet thanks trav man you are absolute beasts it's called the rosso limo yeah so we're currently up upon he can play bishop d6 and win the pawn back but it's you know it's not um it's not clear who benefits from that because we also have a passport on a5 and stuff so uh it's a very very complex position lots to take into account here uh let's see how he decides to play this thank you um mq so i'm getting a lot of christmas presents here early and that is honestly awesome so appreciate it well bishop b6 we go queen b7 so we're not trying to cling to our extra pawn here thank you chris g s y for the prime we're not trying to cling to our extra fun what we're trying to do is give away the pond with interest that is a a thing that i want people to understand when you are up upon one of the one of the benefits of being up upon is that you can give it back with interest you can give it back at the right moment uh and you can give it back and gain something in return if that makes sense and this is what we're essentially trying to do here so i would definitely prefer bishop d6 and bishop takes e5 here he's burning a lot of clock trying to find the best way to do this and i think he's failed to do that because he is attacking art rook where should we put our rook where should we put a rook this is not a very complicated question because yeah we just go rook a6 we attack the knight we are threatening to take it radio math thank you for the two months i appreciate it okay so he's done something really weird here right he just drops his knight's a4 he doesn't recapture the pawn now we can go about improving our position so what i don't like about this position is this pin this pin is annoying me because the knight can't move let's get the rook out of the pin let's also put it on a file where it x-rays the queen okay now um let's just go h6 create some love for the king and also cover the g5 square okay so now we need to find a way to basically push his pieces away from uh no problem okay we're no problem at all yeah so like i may be this is actually not so easy i see what he's trying to do here f5 is see i'll explain this after the game f5 our position is way too fragile to allow for something like f5 and i'll sort of flesh that out after the game let's go king h7 here okay let's preemptively uh defend the h6 pawn so that if he plays bishop e3 which he does uh he's not attacking the pawn and we actually have a tempo here to do what we want to do and what white is threatening here to go knight c5 we move our rook away and he cripples our pawn structure with knight takes e6 how can we preempt that yeah we can consider actually i really like weed c8 for several reasons part of it is that i support the bishop on e6 and another part of it is that you can definitely consider a sack on h3 although you know when we do sack on h3 we will only have a queen in the attack and that's a danger zone kind of thing okay so he takes we take okay bishop b6 okay rook db8 maybe okay he wants to take this way but then his bishop becomes kind of trapped okay if we take on b6 by the way he takes our rook so we have to take okay so let's try to trap his bishop here and in order to trap his bishop uh we need to make sure that the pawn on b4 is safely protected how can we safely protect that pawn yeah we can go c5 we also incidentally create the threat of knight c6 okay so he finds a really really good move um but hmm okay let's go queen to a6 let's swing the queen around let's first swing the queen around and then we'll go knight c6 he potentially can tuck his bishop away like this but let's see if he does that yeah this is where these people have actually become incredibly good yeah he finds a way to get out of this now he's attacking the pawn now he's attacking the pawn we need to defend it let's defend it with our queen and then we can try to centralize our knight with knight to d4 let's see if he allows us to do that perhaps okay well glad glad you have so knight c4 doesn't actually work how do we prepare an it4 ah but he wants this now let's go rookie let's let's occupy the file let's occupy the file let's not let him go rook a1 okay b3 or c so we could play b3 but then he goes for b1 and then he attacks the pawn which is not a pleasant outcome so let's ignore this let's ignore this and let's uh let's try to double on the a file let's try to double on the eightfold i'm gonna have to play a little bit faster guys because i'm very low on time so let's uh let's play a little bit faster but what i'm trying to do here is jogging for position oh and blended one now this guy is like a absolute beast this guy is an absolute monster um he's he's playing like one here i'm basically trying to jock you for a position on the queen side i've actually wanted a pawn here he's refuted that flawlessly and um this is getting very complicated okay so that's another super annoying move yeah honestly he's completely outplayed me here so i'm just losing in this position well not losing but now i'm going to try to get my knight to e6 and i'm gonna try to get that knight around to f4 ultimately no these guys are like insane honestly okay i'm gonna have to play f6 to defend the pawn on e5 yeah i need to be focusing a little bit but i mean i'm still winning most games pretty handily but some sometimes these guys are like incredible sometimes these guys are like absolutely incredibly strong not like 2 300. i'm not expecting them to be weak but you know i actually kind of have forgotten how good these people are so knight f6 is a really good move here for example the the problem is uh he he's he's just too slow he's he's taking like five seconds for a move here but he's finding absolute best moves like every move uh he's just gonna not probably i hope not make it here so we're going to get the knight to see one and attack the spawn rook b oh my god he might make me there i think he might have had mate actually okay we're gonna give him a check okay here to stop the king's progression let's get the night out out of the way yeah okay so that wasn't great um again to give you guys a sense the accuracy in this game very bad yeah my mind was bad it was 92.6 for my opponent 74.2 for us so not not one of my best games um but you know really good play by my opponent honestly well again well let's not speculate um i think he played like a gm but but he played legitimately so he found some incredibly strong ideas all right so basically okay no but his opening was incredibly good so basically this move b4 is super strong and this is actually a very thematic breakthrough in this line well i would say this i think my opponent played on a gm level throughout the game not just not just in the opening uh or not just in the end of the game but he outplayed me from a position where i thought that black was close to winning he found a way to get his bishop out so it was really back and forth so thematic thematic comes from the word theme and when i talk about a thematic idea um i'm talking about an idea that commonly occurs in this type of position maybe not specifically in this position although i'm sure probably it has but it occurs commonly in these types of positions in fact i could make a chess-based search as i'm peeing i'm going to let chess base do its work and i promise that i will find for you guys several grandmaster game examples of exactly this concept uh in in grand master games that's really what i mean from by thematic here is literally uh dvora's 2440 falling into the same exact well kind of trap okay you guys can see knight c4 okay he goes f6 and uh i played queen c7 in this exact position but f6 b4 aba5 and this is like literally the exact same thing happens it's it's semen but a different one um and and he he crushes the guy he crushes the guy uh basically the whole queen side explodes and he plays uh a brilliant brilliant game i plays a brilliant game okay uh anyways i just okay now i know what people are focusing on i made a mistake choosing this guy not the 500 others um so i should have realized that but basically that's one example of why this is uh thematic crucial mistake right so you guys can see that this is literally the same thing a takes before a5 and um if c takes b4 then bishop takes b6 and bishop takes a5 the problem here is that this pawn on b6 is the culprit the pawn on b6 is a backward pawn which means that if there is a white pawn that gets to it things start to collapse here and this is exactly what happens if b5 it's all good guys then knight b6 and you attack the rook and then bishop takes c5 comes and white takes this pawn black's position collapses completely i hope that makes sense so i decided to take but after bishop takes c5 thanks for a good night with the tier one um black is up upon answer for cha with the two one it's hard for me to like explain this verbally but even though black is currently up upon my position is on the verge of collapsing because white's got all these moves and all these other pawns are really weak in fact white is even threatening to take on before and you can't take back because the rook on 8 is hanging so a lot of people were suggesting f5 but you know this is like starting another fire there's already so many fires burning and you're starting another fire in the center of the board black will not be able to sustain this move thank you the dead rooster for the tier one if that makes sense so for example bishop takes v4 is good here or bishop d6 and bishop takes e5 rooting out the bishop and um well i do a position search basically and so this position is super concerning that's why i got my bishop out and now my opponent played really weirdly knight v6 is super weird um i think bishop d6 is probably the most sensible and and then just taking on e5 i'm not sure what white is better here but um you know but but white restores material equality and now the bishop is not going to be good so you know so that would have been good but my opponent played this which i mean i guess it made sense in the end and um it's interesting but it keeps me with an extra pawn now i go rook d8 he goes rookie one and now i miss the super five head maneuver which i actually saw but i thought that i wasn't in a hurry and i should have been now this bishop on e6 is a bit of a problem piece it has no good like roll it's not really doing anything it's just sort of sitting there and um we could have actually employed it we could have actually led it to a square where it's doing something but it involves a really really nice maneuver could somebody spot it like seeing this is no easy task really bishop c4 is right bishop c4 bishop b5 and then the bishop is putting pressure on the knight and the reason that matters is because if the knight ever moves then a4 becomes a possibility pushing that pawn that pass spawn so this idea i saw but i decided to play h6 first just improving the position unfortunately he goes queen c1 and now bishop c4 is no longer possible because there's no more pin okay and now he he starts out playing bishop e3 is super good vacating that square for the knight so we drop the queen back in order to defend the bishop but now he takes and goes bishop b6 and amazingly after rook d8 rook a5 like i thought i was trapping his bishop but this knight d2 move is super annoying this knight d2 move is super annoying he gets his knight to c4 and the knight will support the bishop and i didn't see a good way to do to do to travel i didn't see a good way to trap the bishop absolutely man awesome so basically i didn't see a good way to trap the bishop because the bishop has this square the bishop has this square and basically uh i played queen a6 this is the mistake i should have kept the queen here gone here i saw i heard about that and it's very important to be flexible i didn't practice what i preached i didn't practice what i preached and what i preached is that um you have to be very flexible in the way that you think about certain things so for example okay you've come to terms with the fact that you can't trap the bishop right the bishop is not going to get trapped because it has this hiding square okay that's not a problem let's go knight t4 let's improve the position of the knight and maybe break through with b3 so instead i stubbornly tried to pursue the bishop and my opponent got it to d6 now the bishop is perfectly safe and guess what now he gets his queen to b2 and he can go c3 he starts breaking through and my position starts to collapse so i accidentally blundered this pawn on top of that and um you know and okay guys but maybe we can discuss the game uh for now so don't go chasing waterfalls exactly i'll play that song afterward now i'm down upon and my opponent played this perfectly i mean the end game was really bad for me he outplayed me further and uh it's all good and and rookie rook v8 here would have been absolutely devastating actually because there is no defense against this mate if if g5 then he takes f5 and he covers the g6 square so really my big mistake i think it's somewhere in the opening i went wrong but then not going bishop c4 and then like not being flexible being very stubborn trying to pursue this bishop and letting my opponent you know basically gain the upper hand over me rather than just saying okay i'm not going to trap the bishop i'm just going to get my knight to a good square and uh you know come hell or high water basically [Music] you
