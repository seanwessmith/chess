and we're playing tijuna okay well we're gonna play another king's indian since i just spent so long talking about it we might as well play it thank you everybody once again for the tremendous support and all these subs and all the hype it's it's awesome [Music] okay so this guy plays the main line and i'm actually going to play a very interesting line that i myself like to play that's the movie he takes d4 so in effect we've gotten the marotzi by instructor from the last game but there's one key difference i have the pawn on c7 rather than on e7 what difference does that make well that gives me a direct line of fire to the e4 pawn how do i build on that direct line if i what breakthrough can i prepare and this is also the main line thank you yo aguan 21. what is the sort of typical idea c65 that's the main line season now knight c6 there is also possible but the move c6 is the sort of combative line king h1 he knows the the best move now what we're supposed to do here is go knight out to h5 this should not surprise anybody who's been paying attention to the previous king's indian game this opens up possibilities like queen h4 and it opens up one more very important possibility he's put his bishop on a square where it's type one undefended we have a rook on e8 that's x-raying it how could we combine the two bring those together f5 bingo we want to drive this pawn into f4 that creates a stronghold for the knight on g3 and i'll explain how to use that assuming he doesn't go crazy here okay so he's prevented f4 he me we ask ourselves straight away the sam shankland question what happens if we do it anyway can we play f4 anyway yes or no no says mrsupio we can because if he takes it then we take and then he takes he drops his knight on t4 now the typical move is to centralize our bishop on e5 it's a nice central outpost and there is a particular sacrifice here that we are beginning to eye and we actually can apply it immediately what am i talking about this is a very very typical idea in this position it's not d5 anymore he's clamped down on that it is the move knight to g3 check after the game i will unpack this properly so it may seem that we should take the rook on f1 but here's the thing guys and i'm going to blow your mind um taking the rook is what i would do against another grandmaster but we are going to go for checkmate ladies and gentlemen and i'm going to try to apply okay well he's actually going to prevent it sort of hmm let me think yeah so bishop d4 was a really really good move and i will explain everything after the game but let us take the exchange so that we don't forfeit this opportunity now we've won the exchange and we need to abide by the key principle that i always talk about which is that when you've won material the number one cause of disaster after winning material is to forget to continue applying basic principles such as continuing your development so let's not forget to continue our the best move here for him would be c5 but he helps us out by trading pieces get cementing our pawn structure all we need to do here to consolidate our advantage is to develop the knight bring the rook to d8 can we do that here or do we need to defend the pawn can we do both what should black do here take a moment to tell me the best move in this position knight d7 anyway exactly and we can always smoke this queen out by playing queen to e7 in fact that's what we're going to do on the next move yeah we're up in exchange he goes queen c7 he's going hunting for our pawns um that's actually a very good move and here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go queen to d8 wait a minute daniel you're blundering the pawn no oh he takes the queen thank you what would i have done against queen b7 i was planning to trade queens with queen b6 okay now those of you who are paying very careful attention well what should we do where should we put this knight those of you paying attention to the previous king's indian game should now know that nothing happened to this idea we're threatening a check on d2 which would win the night and how can we cement the knight who would like to remind me okay well he's i don't think he's aware that he's down in exchange we're going to put the other rook on d8 we can always play a5 to prevent him from chasing our night away in fact that is what we are going to do just because it's an end game doesn't mean that the typical middle game ideas don't apply let's not forget now to bring our king into the picture if he goes a3 how do we promote and now let's begin to attack the king side same we're playing this as if it's a middle game because the same ideas apply uh other than bringing our king into the game which uh so because the same ideas apply how do we proceed on the king's side what do we do look at this position it's like a textbook king's indian position that c6 pawn protecting d5 absolutely we should push the pawn now this does a couple things it breaks through we have a pathway should we want it for the king to get all the way to g3 that would be sort of the like russian school of but but instead we'll go g3 but aren't you locking up the position isn't that good for white actually no i want you guys to pay very careful attention to the g2 pawn some of you i know are tempted by this move it doesn't work let's find a more methodical way to to apply pressure on that pawn what should we do how how do we maneuver one of our pieces which has already done its job on its current location and that's another key thing this is flexibility of thinking oftentimes people get like almost emotionally attached to like the placement of one particular piece but you gotta understand that it's done its job and now we always remember to look at the undefended pieces the knight on c2 is undefended we also pay attention to the x-rays and as you guys beautiful job guys bishop h3 textbook style idea forcing the pawn out then we're going to take the knight and promote our pawn or force him to give up his bishop for it the game is over yep you guys are uh very very sharp at this ungodly hour and uh i love to see it so that just ends the game okay well here we just take on g2 and okay knight you one doesn't actually attack anything so we can just take and um now the knight is lost boom over we're gonna send our knight forward and check madam or promote our pawn one of many ways and he resigns very nice game and uh sort of clearly showed the king's indian ideas now king h1 is a good prophylactic move right because he's getting his king out from potential ideas like this the best move here for white is to go g4 and this is theory this sends the knight back to f6 which is what i had planned to do right at weakens the king's side but white has this crazy night at five night sacrifice which um which gel fund actually developed a couple years ago and this has thrown very serious doubts thank you see don for five bucks this has thrown very serious doubts on the sort of objective value of this line there's a lot of analysis here but by and large uh galfond won a very nice game here and uh to that to this date this line hasn't really recovered but this is kind of what i'm saying right just because it's not viable at a grand master level doesn't mean you shouldn't play it and i want to make that very clear so f5 very typical idea and to show you guys um what i had planned to do so knight g3 check actually is simple if he takes we take and we created a direct avenue to his king so this is like the most classical mate in history now um to show you guys why i didn't take the rook what is the ultimate purpose of queen h4 i want to show you guys a game against a very strong player and let's see if i can pull this off quickly because it was played only chess and um i need to actually find this game and download it into chess space so let me see and this was against yon kristoff duda that's why i really wanted to find this game because it was against jan christophe duda in my match against him naruto vs the world duda july 2020. here we go so guess which line it was this line king h1 so i played knight a6 in this game um which is sort of a rare line that i that i experimented on and duda believe it or not he missed exactly the same idea that we applied in this game in fact this game was almost identical to the game we just played f5 same thing queen d2 can we play f4 yes we can same thing bishop e5 literally the same moves rook fd1 knight g3 anyway it's not a fork anymore but it doesn't matter if he takes we take it's the same concepts king age king g1 queen h4 rook ab1 rook f8 now could somebody tell me what is the idea of this move and this is exactly what i was trying to do during uh during my game but my opponent kind of put an end to it what are we doing why do we put the rook on f6 yeah rook f6 b5 g5 and b takes a6 he simply failed to see the idea well he played bishop f1 thinking that he prevents rook h6 due to age three but no what do we do boom and he resigned and he simply forgot to check the other order because this is checkmate so again always always always two move line check the move order what if you do the second thing first even if it's a queen sacrifice you have to do that and that one's the game so that's where this all came from i've had other games like this but because this was against duda i wanted to show this sort of specifically okay so bishop d4 here i decided to take now why does this not work because he's got the f2 square this entire operation wouldn't have worked because the king has the evacuation square so bishop e6 he does all of our bidding for us knight d7 just the only thing i'll point out here if he takes b7 i can go rook b8 takes b2 that probably would have been even better but my original inclination was to use that technique i mentioned right giving up a pawn strategically to trade queens maybe not the best but really the simplest um and i mentioned that you have to be careful about that so we just deployed the knight we stopped before and then we just attacked the the king said everything here i explained during the game i think everybody understands bishop h3 is the traditional sort of classical idea breaking through and the game is over and we are white against roy christian 224 let's go with an e4 yeah we'll free the plebs after the game okay so let's continue playing the c3 sicilian i've sort of stuck to this as my main opening against the sicilian and and he actually goes here so we have a fundamental choice here we can go for an advanced french uh we can go for an advanced french but i think it's more thematic to actually take on d5 because this is more in the spirit of the c3 sicilian now we should develop our knight this is following the famous game hesneridski and knight f6 deviates from that game so how should we think about this position well i have a choice of capturing on c5 and that leads to a structure called the iqp isolated queen pawn and as i've repeated many times in the iqp there's a couple of important things the first is to to defend the square in front of the pawn and we kind of have that under control but the other thing is trades are usually good for the side that defends against the iqp so here we're going to develop our bishop with tempo and we're going to continue developing with castle what we're doing is we're waiting for him to move his bishop out and only when he moves his bishop out do we do what we save a lot of time in fact we make make him waste time what do we do only after he moves his bishop which he just did what is it finally time for us to now do now we take the pawn so that we force this bishop to move twice in fact he doesn't take what can we now do there's actually several ways to preserve the extra pawn what's the most sort of thematic way and because we have most of our pieces developed we shouldn't be afraid of a move like a5 right because we have our pieces developed we don't actually need to do anything we don't need to play a3 we can simply proceed with our development we can grab the d4 square but we sort of have that square under control so what i'm going to do is actually go bishop to b2 and it this move may look kind of weird to some of you guys because the bishop looks lame i will explain it after well i don't actually need to explain it as you can see that was the whole idea had we basically are preparing for him to take whoa uh okay okay so he just gives up a piece great uh all right well uh there's nothing we can do about that so let's actually develop our knight to d2 in order not to block the bishop's control over the long diagonal knight b to d2 okay now this may look like we blundered right he skewers the bishops and we don't need to panic by taking on f6 how can we protect this bishop in the most robust way there are several ways to do it we can go a4 that's what we're gonna do we could have also gone queen b3 but i appreciate that people are following the rule of defending pieces with pawns now let's let's throw in h3 to make some luft for the king and now i'm actually quite annoyed at the fact that we're pinned let's unpin ourselves by playing queen b3 now we can we don't have to worry about this because the bishop is so robustly defended that there's no way that he can exploit this uh standoff in fact we are the only ones who could exploit okay knight e4 he's trying to stir up chaos which is exactly what you should do when you're down a lot of material now what does this move specifically accomplish well he's piling up on the f2 square with three different pieces so we should absolutely take the knight queen takes d5 was a little bit more complicated there and where should we put this knight who can tell me in the spirit of playing actively where should we plant this knight what is a nice central square where the knight is safely protected absolutely where is the knight threatening to go 92 would be a little bit passive and and this is actually quite an important moment a lot of people get in trouble because they play passively when they're up material now we're threatening to go to d7 as you guys see but not anymore he stops it because then he takes on d7 our queen is unprotected very important to recognize that so what should we do in a situation like this well our default should always be to bring pieces into the game and but our secondary default should be to ask ourselves what he wants he wants to plant a rook on d2 you guys see that if we put a rook on d1 you guys are all forgetting the fact that the bishop is on h5 but because we're up a piece right we don't need to bring the rook in immediately there's no urgency in doing that so what do we do here who can give me a move there is one particular sexy move that i'm thinking of and that is the move queen swings over to g3 and i'm gonna play it a little bit fast because um we're we're a little short of time what am i doing as you guys can probably see i am x-raying the g7 pawn i'm inviting his bishop back let's well we don't actually need to take the bishop but what move is now possible previously was impossible but how is the position changed ah he's moved the bishop back not knight d7 but rook 81 97 and there are some tactical details here too to talk about knight d7 there was a tactical mistake inherent in that move so we're just going to take the pawn and between h2 and h1 king h2 would potentially bring the king and the queen to the same diagonal i don't like the tactical ramifications of that so i'm gonna play king h1 in case he takes on e3 you see taking care of your future soft now does that mean that he literally would have put a bishop on f4 probably not but why risk it you see what i'm saying now we're completely winning we have all of our pieces and finally we are threatening knight to d7 depending on what he does i don't really even see a good way for him to stop it he gives up this rook uh but i actually prefer to keep the bishop on the board it's such a strong piece that let's actually take the other rook not only is it going to youtube but those of you who are kind of not following um you know i prepared you for this we're at a relatively high rating so i'll explain everything in great detail after the game uh and again prepare with your questions i'm here to answer questions i'm not frustrated at them okay who can propose for me a approach to winning the game um let's play this by the book queen d6 is great buy the book activate your pieces okay queen to d6 what are we threatening specifically well bishop c5 that's a good move he drops his bishop back where can we put our queen how can we put our queen let's put it on e5 let's induce a weakness let's obviously i don't think i'm under no illusions that he's going to blunt or check me that's not the point the point is that i'm inducing a weakness and now i'm gonna i'm gonna do something quite beautiful we're gonna give him a check okay guys and now we have a beautiful win who can find it here's what i'm seeing his king is out of squares which means that if we can rip apart this diagonal this will be checkmate boom goes the dynamite rook takes f6 and that is a theme which i saw most famously in one of harry nelson pillsbury's games 19th century american master he had a very famous game that ended in very very similar fashion i'll see if i can find it after the game and uh he sacrificed the queen similarly now here we can do a bunch of different things um but we need to be careful and and one of them is if we take on e8 and go rook fade remember that that square is protected if we go right cafe takes with a bishop but what we can do is play rook takes g6 what am i doing the same idea as ror cafe this is a discovered attack on the pawn the only difference is uh we're not inviting his bishop to go to f8 i'll i'll spell all this out after the game and actually the pillsbury game i don't really need to track it down it's a classic game where there was a very similar concept uh it's not anything to write home about and that is a pretty sex nomination to end the game thank you thank you for agreeing with me that this is in fact quite sexy no the snipers are the snipers are real i mean 18 seconds is enough because it's made in two at the most let's see if he can allow us to sacrifice our queen if he goes bishop f8 we can take on g7 with the queen and it's checkmate and he resigns nice game okay let's analyze so to be clear in the opening we can play the movie five and if you know that your opponent doesn't play the french and you do play the advanced french this would be a sensible move because you would be in territory that is familiar to you your opponent would be an unfamiliar territory i don't happen to play the events french and i don't know this guy maybe he does play the french so i decided to keep the spirit of the elephant thank you very cabbage now he we take he takes we develop our knight against robert i played the move c4 um you can find in the vods my analysis if that came two more subs now 69 and a tizzle thank you let's go uh let's release the plebs let's release the print plebs um all right thank you guys appreciate the subs welcome okay you guys are now welcome to ask questions so here he goes knight f6 that's the main line and actually i think knight bd7 is quite inaccurate uh knight bd7 is quite inaccurate but let's please focus back on the game okay okay so knight bd7 is inaccurate why because he blocks the development of his own bishop if he goes bishop d7 that's the theoretical move i would have taken and then i would have castled and you get a position like this where you know i think white has a minuscule edge uh and who can tell me why that is when you're looking at this position and black is an isolated queen's pawn what critical factor do you have to look for in any iqp position what specific thing uh dictates oftentimes who's in charge yes exactly so who has control of the square in front of the pawn here clearly the answer is white i'm basically in charge of that square but black is very solid i'm not really attacking the pawn itself so if white does have an edge it's very very minuscule so anyways he goes knight p7 we castle first we get him to move his bishop and only then do we take d takes c5 forcing him to waste time taking with the bishop he decides to give that pawn up entirely here we would have given a check and isolated queen's pawn and here we could have stopped him from castling with queenie two among other things and uh this is a very nasty situation for black because he has a very hard time completing his development that's how bad these things can get okay so he castles we defend a5 should be two this is moment number one uh those of you who are around for my explanation of potential energy should yeah pawn c6 would have been good should have um oh knight takes e5 was impossible the night with spin should kind of understand this move what i'm doing is i'm gearing up i'm a niche gearing up for a takes before i'm anticipating that this will happen okay and when this happens and it did my bishop is tremendously strong it's on the long diagonal now you might ask well what if it doesn't happen well if it doesn't happen then the bishop is still okay uh like i always say you don't need every one of your pieces to to be scaling mount everest at any given moment we're also just connecting our rooks and getting our piece out and um i didn't see a particularly good other score for the bishop i guess we could have put it on f4 but one thing i was kind of worried about is uh leaving this diagonal unattended and i was a little bit worried about a scenario where he gets let's say a bishop to f6 you guys can see right how that could be a little bit nasty so i decided to prophylactically put my own bishop on b2 even if he doesn't take on before i'm discouraging him from trying to get something on the long diagonal all right that's it's more of a prophylactic move he takes and he plays a very weird move knight takes c5 if he tried to undermine my pawn chain i would have of course played c6 that's kind of the point black isn't in huge trouble here down the pawn and i've got an amazing position now the rest is quite simple a4 defending the bishop and let's fast forward to the cool part a lot of people here have a tendency to go backward knight d2 very passive and this allows e3 um and and that's kind of a nasty move so knight takes the queen takes d5 would have been i think inferior because it would have allowed a lot of complications uh related to bishop takes that to check i'm sure that white is still winning probably i can skirt around these checks but why allow all of these complications particularly since we're up a piece uh and and you don't want to take that too far sometimes you have to allow complications but uh there are other times when you can make a judgment call and decide that oops sorry there are other times when you can make a judgment call and decide that um you don't need this okay you need to consider the alternative so knight takes c4 is what i did just to keep things simple 95 centralizing the night and now knight d7 why is this wrong because the rook takes d7 and i can't take because the queen is undefined but how would you see that you would see that because i've already reminded people to always check for undefended pieces particularly standoffs this is a queen standoff and standoffs are you know hot beds of tactics particularly when one of the pieces is is undefended um okay and so that's how we would kind of note this down so therefore we moved our queen away from the standoff i didn't want it and while we're doing it we create more pressure on the g7 pawn he drops his bishop back we don't need to take the bishop our knight is very very strong here we don't need to rush to trade now we go rook 81 e3 is no longer dangerous because he's got no pieces to follow this up with and why not knight t7 in this position guess what we moved our queen away the bishop on b2 is still undefended and we still have to have to note that down he plays rook takes d7 and he gets two pieces for a rook which is we're still better but we're only up in exchange now no need for that therefore we go rook 81 in order to prepare this move and bring our rook to an open file okay now knight d7 finally take the rook uh queen d6 screen back to e5 attacking g7 check and now the key concept why didn't i take the bishop on e3 because it was protected by the the queen on a7 it was basically protecting that square uh and here i noticed that the king is out of squares you actually that's something a lot of people don't i think do is detect situations where the king simply has no squares i know that sounds very obvious but you need to categorize that scenario in your mind because in that scenario if you open up more diagonals and files it's very likely that there's going to be some sort of checkmating ideas that's exactly what we kind of thought of here king has no squares to escape so that if we can open up this diagonal it's going to be checkmate and the most obvious way of opening the diagonal is simply to crash through on f6 takes takes and bishop takes f6 doesn't queen takes f6 lead to the same mate actually yeah so queen f6 is working but it's actually not that simple because what you should be afraid of and what you should not assume is that he has to recapture here he doesn't have to recapture the rook whereas if you start by this move he's basically compelled to capture the queen because you're also threatening checkmate however if we take with the queen what should white do in this position instead of taking the rock this speaks to the concept of tactical flexibility always paying attention uh to the other tactical ideas and position not just tunnel visioning check bishop f8 and now using the x-ray to deliver checkline that one's the game so he will he goes for k8 and now rook fade is very tempting i thought of this initially but it doesn't work because bishop takes that fate and the bishop simultaneously defends the pawn on g7 um and hopefully that makes sense but but the idea is correct right we need to expose the queen's attack on g7 that's fine uh that is fine but we need to find the best way to do that and the key observation is that the rook can't move away from the e file he's not actually really threatening to take our queen he actually is because the e8 square is covered but by taking on g6 we chop the legs off from that and so this is going to be checkmate okay so we use logical thinking in this way we don't jump to conclusions we don't make the move that kind of looks right we we specifically okay let's take care of that thank you uh we specifically um you know look for stuff thank you look for stuff rather than trying to ah this is what would be in a tactics book kind of stuff okay any questions any questions okay noe thank you for the pram was knight c7 a decent alternative to 95 um i'm not sure which move you're referring to because knight c7 was this square why are we taking the bishop instead of rook on e8 um well we didn't also not sure what's referred to but bishop takes e8 i didn't want to give away this bishop i i didn't want to give away this very very important bishop on me too i wanted to take the better rook of course this is completely winning but i wanted to be precise as precise as possible all right guys um we can ignore stuff like that okay um back to the how do you save your games well they're auto saved when was his bishop on h why couldn't you play bishop e2 well bishop b2 where well bishop b2 was was unnecessary right and it would also drop this bishop how do you know which pieces to keep in which well that's what i'm trying to illustrate through the lens of the speedrun why did his bishop have to leave h5 because we were x-raying the pawn if he makes a random move we can move our knight away attack his queen and simultaneously threaten checkmate he can defend both with queen g6 but now he ends up dropping his bishop or his rook so that was basically why he went bishop g6 probably not the best move but he's already basically busting uh yeah you can play knight c4 but uh why why move the knight away from its most active post you know why help him uh beef up the kingside security so there's really no need no need for that move i know it's tempting to attack his queen but ask yourself is that piece uh in the resulting position going to be worth moving there in the first place and the answer here is kind of no i'm gonna end the stream for five seconds and then i will restart okay so i'm about to end my stream for five seconds and i will restart it okay disconnecting in three two [Music] you
