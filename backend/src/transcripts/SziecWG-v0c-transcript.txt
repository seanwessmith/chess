[Music] we do we are who we are okay so let's play e4 playing grigor georgiev so he plays the french now i've experimented in the french with various lines and this time i'm going to play the taurash this is what i play as my actual main line now in the torah it's sort of a version of the advanced french where white builds up this pawn chain and black attacks it now the reason we put the knight on d2 and not c3 is because i now have the move c3 which defends the pawn now where does the bishop belong here on which square would the bishop be most active in this position yeah we can do something tomorrow all right your bishop d3 is correct and uh now knight gf3 to depend upon and this is where things kind of get cool this is still theory um why not bishop b5 is something i'll explain afterward and he goes f6 now this move is kind of a famous mistake the drawback of this move is that it creates this diagonal for my queen and i want a queen to get on h5 so what i need to do here is distract him in order to get my queen h5 distract him often means sacrifice by sacrificing something we're able to to divert his attention away from needing to defend against queen h5 so what sacrifice would do that yeah i'll talk through everything after the game we haven't had many french's i know that i haven't fully explained the ideas for for each side knight g5 here is correct there's more to this than that logic there's a lot of variations but this is a famous move um which leads to a lot of complications knight d takes e5 is black's best response here opening up the d7 square for the king if he takes on on g5 i go queen h5 and his king gets into a lot of trouble that's not the end of the story there's a lot of variations there i don't actually know all of them but the logic verbally should be clear to people i want to go queen h5 because never play f6 and he can't castle because his bishop obstructs his king from escaping um why is knight g5 an effective move that distracts him because the knight also attacks e6 so he needs to attend to that and in attending to that he cannot also defend against queen h but if that makes sense um but but the bottom line is i want a queen on h5 and i want to do it with tempo if i move my knight let's say to h4 that would be a telegraphed pass as we say in basketball okay so he decides to defend e6 but he does allow queen h5 and um it's sort of one bad thing or the other bad thing actually that's okay so this is where a lot of people slip up because there's a lot of tempting moves it's not entirely clear which of them we should prefer knight f7 here is super tempting but that's not the end of the story because if we go knight f7 he actually goes queen e8 i want people to pay very careful attention to this okay and what happens then is that our queen is going to be pinned our knight is actually going to be pinned so we don't actually want to play knight f7 here we want to basically say this okay he's already moved his gang out which is good so we can decide between a couple of things but the simplest is just to drop our knight back to three there's nothing wrong with just saying look his king is super weak his position is bad i'm not going to deal with any of the complications that arise after moves like 96 or 907 i'm just going to play the russian school of chess brings the knight back very very slow a lot of people get into trouble because they assume i have to have a win here let me spend three minutes trying to find a win they don't see anything they get frustrated and they go for a move anyway it's totally fine to make a modest move and basically celebrate or small victory so now what's going on he does have a connected protected passer on d5 but because it's the middle game i don't really care our plan now obviously we don't we don't want to trade queens because we're attacking is to complete our development which means we need a castle and we need to bring this bishop out this bishop is blocked by the knight so where can we put this knight such that the knight also accomplishes something and get this bishop what square would we potentially put the knight on and what would the knight be doing on that square what would the knight yeah so knight v3 potentially aiming for d4 but first let's castle you guys already know the square in front of a past or isolated pawn should be blockaded now do we need to defend this pawn here's a clear try this on for size do we need to defend this pawn or can we play an ip3 so what should you notice here in this position if you've been practicing tactical awareness as i have suggested the king and the queen ladies and gentlemen are on the same diagonal okay that everybody should notice that which means that if he moves his knight away and we take that knight we'll be able to pin him in the end but that's not even the main reason the main reason is the e-file getting opened is going to be a disaster frame that's going to be worth the sacrifice so he sees it uh let's get the bishop out to f4 not because we're defending the pawn but because we're creating an x-ray against this king that's the main reason we're putting the bishop on f4 also it's good to defend but how should we continue deploying our pieces such that they basically prepare for attack prepare slowly attack fast we don't need to play knight d4 yet let's play rook c1 for now let's see what he does and we can also put the knight on c5 that's also super active square but i like the move knight d4 because it exploits the pin where can this knight go from d4 yep he allows it where can this knight go now yeah we can go for this beautiful outpost on d6 he's done a really good job getting his king to relative safety but he's done that at the cost of all of these positional things and king on b8 is not going to be safe forever we're eventually going to use our pawns to uh kick away some of his pieces and i think the c file is going to be what we're going to use to ultimately get to him yeah that square is amazing so when i say we're going to use our pawns to kick away his pieces what specifically do i mean by that what move am i referring to here yeah so we're going to play before there's a pretty complicated reason why knight takes b4 is bad if he plays it i mean you'll be able to see and that reason relates to the knight on before being unprotected um and if you look at the whole board you'll notice the x-ray that the queen is exerting on the night uh whenever there's an x-ray like that you should be thinking discover checks or discovered attacks and so we'll eventually have the move bishop g5 beautiful guys you all see it now a lot of people here would just mindlessly play a4 now there's a really really cool oh look at this variation we're going to play a4 but not mindlessly because here's the thing he's probably going to take the pawn no he's not okay he kind of acquiesces but i would i'll show you guys what happens after he takes the pawn okay how should we proceed oh think about it how should we proceed so i'm actually going to give you guys a crazy thought let's not play rook c1 yet let's first take away the c6 square from his pieces because here's the thing if he plays a takes b5 a takes b5 we might immediately put the rook on a1 which is a newly opened file this is simply more flexible and you guys know the expression by now the threat is stronger than its execution guess what i am going to put the rook on a1 and the reason i'm going to do that is because there's a knight there and c1 is a little bit better defended by his pieces the squares along the c pile are better defended by his pieces because it's closer to his pieces the a file on the other hand is like the wild west now we can go bishop e3 and skewer his knights all right so okay so he does a good job trying to trade the knights but he doesn't have enough resources to make it happen what can we do what can we do so look at this knife for a second this knight is a type 2 undefended piece which means if we apply pressure on it and then this knight moves away it's going to be entirely undefended so we can actually play the move bishop to e3 putting pressure on the knight if he takes this one we are not going to take with a pawn that would open up his bishop it wouldn't blunder the rope because we attacked the queen but we take this one because now you guys can see that the a7 square is under our control uh now we start looking for various checkmating ideas we also need to bring the queen into the attack queen a4 is actually not very possible because of knight takes b6 but where can we put the queen so that we both defend the bishop and sort of aim indirectly at the a5 where can we put the queen yeah we can play queen d4 i don't really like partying with the bishop but you know partying with it involves the queen on b6 that would be pretty crushing so he has to choose between several equally unappealing options later we can bring the bishop back before playing queen a4 we can also play bishop a7 check um in these positions as i've emphasized in various points uh there's usually multiple ways to finish the attack and you kind of have to choose it's often a matter of taste and you shouldn't be obsessed with necessarily finding the best option or assume that there's only one you should try to be precise but uh you should do that without you know losing on time or anything like that there's always a balance if that makes sense okay bishop f8 is a good move he's stopping our bishop from dropping back to c5 we can still go to a7 oh he'll be joe with another five we can go to a7 um that's possible and actually not only is that possible that's what we're gonna do let's drag the king to c seven and how do we keep pursuing the king how do we keep pursuing the king um rook c1 is correct very good guys now look at this beautiful square ah don't we want to rook on this beautiful square let's get bishop e6 back in so that we can pave the way for the rook that comes to c7 now notice our back rank our back rig is not an issue queen before if we might miss that one but no problem just retreat our queen it's okay we just retreat our queen that's the thing a lot of people struggle they see a move like this they panic we don't actually need to panic now we're going to create some love for our king and um let's bring our bishop back so he can't take it he's actually done a really good job defending he's still losing but i have to give him some kudos let's take b7 this is completely lost though uh his position just collapsed now where can we put our queen to angle at his king which square can we put our queen on why don't you guys let me know okay queen h6 yeah he's going to lose on time but uh he's completely lost here maybe i did an attack in the best possible way but that's another thing that you should bear in mind when you put pressure on your opponent throughout the entire game uh you put him under so much pressure that it takes time to defend against these threats it takes time to defend well that's the thing in classical chess also that was a really nice game now the tarash is knight d2 knight c3 is more popular that's sort of the main line but 92 is what i play the broad you know cost benefit analysis here indicates that we can play c3 later which builds up that pawn chain on the other hand we block the development of the bishop so there's a clear plus and a minus to this move and um we played according to theory up until this point f6 i think is is a considered a mistake because of knight g5 and there's some really complicated lines here which i don't want to delve into too much but i'll just show you guys one one cool idea so after fd queen h5 and um after g6 we can take on g6 and go queen g6 and now if i remember correctly i might be wrong here uh why not bring the dark squared bishop out before that night that's a good question so why why are we even bringing the knight out because he's technically attacking the pawn of shalama so we can play bishop e3 but we blunder the pawn so sadly we have to attend to the pawn so that means you know we can't develop an eye in an ideal fashion if we could yeah we would definitely play bishop e3 so bishop d3 is a legitimate move but what happens then is he takes and he uses this bishop to develop his pieces with tempo so he gets this little edge in development and then he strikes in the center uh this is a legitimate variation but white doesn't have any advantage here another five bull oh yolo sapien three gifted you guys are spoiling me as always thank you yolo safety and chess genie pdx lion and dark dark and chris loving the hype folks does that make sense yeah so basically there's a lot of finer theoretical points that i'm not telling you guys it's all before thank you which is like 92 is more popular here this is the old school move and basically i can explain why like 92 is usually played rather than knight f3 the old school reasoning there's two main reasons that people of the old school play 92 the first is they thought this knight could go to f3 and that would open up the pathway for the bishop and it would it would protect the pawn right which is super important that's number one number two black has this very typical idea in the french which looks psycho but it's actually very common which is g5 g4 are you kidding me another five james barnett 93 five gifted damn girl five gifted another another bomb thank you appreciate it so much james burnett and this could dislodge the knight from f3 and by dislodging the knight the pawn on d4 loses its support and you guys might be looking at this and saying bro like what's the big deal i can just take on c5 why are we trying to hog the spawn on d4 well that breaks up the pawn chain okay and that creates a weakness on e5 so black can take c5 and then we'll have a very hard time defending this bond does that make sense our center collapses and um therefore we need to keep the pawn chain intact but according to modern theory none of these ideas are that scary like g5 can be met with h3 and black doesn't get g4 in it it's just not that simple also this is a very weakening move thank you thailand appreciate it i don't know if that makes sense anyways knight b6 is sort of an admission of defeat check no knight back to f3 so that's the piece of advice i have which is that um if you if if the tempting move results in a mess remember that you can just accept the small victories in the position and save time by making a quiet move thank you james barnett himself something the knight of 728 pins our queen and um this you guys can see i think appreciate that this is a mess maybe he wins the night maybe i win the rook um and oh yeah yeah i forgot to elaborate so in this position after g6 takes king e7 we use the sort of the wish list thing what do we want to achieve here ultimately we're two pieces down because somebody pap studio thank you could somebody tell me what is like the number one item on our wishlist here we want what piece on what square yeah there's a lot of a lot of bishop takes g5 is basically checkmate it wins a million pieces so we need to apply the same logic that we applied when playing knight g5 we need to distract him somehow and in the time that he's distracted we get the bishop out to g5 so what move seems maximally distracting bingo exactly so this knight is centralized the knight itself controls a lot of squares he kind of has to take it and now bishop takes g5 is crushing it's technically not checkmate you can give up all of his pieces but now he's just down a queen so uh i think according to theory this is not winning for white black has some counter sacks i don't want to delve into it but i think that this is good for white i'm not positive though but that's basically the idea the reason we don't take the rook here is because black would have two pieces for a rook and we would basically give black a chance to bring some defenders into the game and this position would be unclear now chris capp asks what about knight takes h7 at which point well knight takes h7 it's still it's black to move and black can get his bishop out connecting the queen to the rook and again we're pinned winning only upon here is is not the point we're striving for more than that also remember something there's still a battle going on on the western front the western front is punching this pawn chain is still liable to collapse let's not forget about that so if this attack doesn't work uh we might not have enough resources we might not have the time to bring our resources back in time to defend this pawn chain it collapses and then it's anybody's game um does that kind of make sense also as akilah points out if we castle king's side guess what we've opened the h file for black so the winning the pawn just isn't sufficient that's why i brought the knight back to f3 sorry because we also defend the pawn chain okay yeah it's only to get a tempo otherwise black has time to defend so he takes everything of course we don't trade queens now we castle we complete our development knight be bringing the bishop out rook ac one bringing the rook into the game knight d4 everything here is very very straightforward now we bring the knight to a very juicy square and hear the move before knight takes b4 as you guys already pointed out this knight is being x-rayed and it's type 1 undefended so bishop g5 attacks the queen exposing the attack on the knight winning a piece believe it or not the move a4 has exactly the same logic but it takes a little bit of finessing so knight takes e4 how do we deconstruct this position here's what i see i see the knight on a4 not only 4 is type 1 undefended it's also x-rayed by the queen there's just a one problem with the x-ray the pawn on before is blocking the x-ring so we go b5 incidentally the move b5 attacks the knight which means he has to attend to that he takes but we still don't want to move the bishop because now the pawn defends the knight what do we want to do first here yeah knight takes exactly we attack the rook black has to attend to that and now finally we go bishop g5 with the same idea as with the knight on b4 queen has to move and we win the night so photochest thank you for the another raid 106 but that's still not the whole story believe it or not that's still not the whole story because the x-ray actually fails what move does black have here i always tell you guys thank you maria when there's a discovered attack you need to check whether the piece that's defended sorry whether the piece that's attacked can cannot move and defend the other piece queen b4 actually defends so what do we need to do first to stop queen b4 with tempo and then we finally will be ready for bishop g5 amazing sequence in my opinion we need to go back to d6 attack the rook again block the queen's pathway and now we go bishop g5 and attack the knight so it's a long sequence but i hope i've made every step of that clear all of it with tempo is super important otherwise black could defend that's a nice line which means he can't take he has to drop it back and here believe it or not the move rook c1 check which a lot of people wanted to play kind of plays into his hands because it helps him make his king safer and i had already anticipated potentially bringing the rook to a1 so b5 blocking his his access to the c6 were making this knight super passive now we get the rook to a1 we bring the bishop back to e3 in order to open up the file for the queen the rank and also to tie ourselves to the b69 he takes this one i take that one he brings the knight back we get the queen into the game if he takes we'll have access to the a7 square that's absolutely deadly bishop f8 bishop a7 anyway we chase his king around and now we bring his king to e8 go rook c7 infiltrating this is like the final stage of the attack i didn't play this perfectly but it was good enough um pawn to b6 was double-sided because i thought about this the problem is we'd have a hard time bringing the bishop into the game and he basically does the same thing he does in the game i guess we can go through b8 but that would take some time you see what i'm saying thiaminoid with the tier 2 sub thank you so bishop b6 infiltrating we're not trading queens making some luft for the king thank you sue 19. and finally we simply take the pawn and deploy the queen into the attack we're threatening various sacrifices white black is completely lost here i could have found better ways to attack i don't want to delve into that too much um why not bishop g5 to attack and clear the row asks the atom 34 i'm assuming you're referring to this position well the problem is we need to recapture a piece right he's just captured a knight so we need to recapture um so we need to find the middle ground here i know it's it's weird to find the middle ground these days uh that word is not used much in society but in chess you sometimes do need to find the middle ground um so bishop a7 or c1 and bishop e6 uh also bishop c5 would be good just trading bishops and then getting the queen over to the c file so i hope i've kind of made everything clear i'm omitting some key details i'm omitting some key details but i i hope that i've partially explained the logic behind the attack thank you for the prime and uh any questions guys any questions yeah so rook c1 was possible there yeah it's minus 1.6 but if you if you let it think for a while i think it changes its evil i think that's a common thing yeah i agree that it's complicated but i hope that people can still trace the logic uh the variations are complicated because that's what chess is but jam jam another five girl but everything we did is relatively straightforward in its intention it's just justified by relatively complicated lines and um hopefully i made that relatively clear okay let's play the next game thank you for the five gifted gem jim let me write down game two okay let's go yeah i know and that's why you practice calculation calculation is is a way of getting your logic to work okay let's go with another e5 exo start that guy watches my stream so let's play the two knights defense against the karo khan which is kind of a thematic way of responding to the car gun the yolo sapien another five amazing and here okay so this is a legitimate variation let's go bishop to c4 wow paul kellerman that wasn't it wasn't a very good guy and let's tickle the bishop let's see what it wants to do and uh white's play here is very straightforward we simply develop okay so he takes we take back we have two bishops now quite nice now we need to get our king back and we need to develop what should we do here let's be very careful uh black has a bit of an annoying idea that we want to prevent we can prevent it of fannie o'daniel 10 subs raising the stakes d4 to stop 95 amazing guys thank you so much what the hell amazing now what's castle we don't we don't have to worry about knight takes c4 incredible guys yeah so he can take and go knight f6 that's typical now we need to find a good place for our queen where should we put our queen here who can who can tell me a solid nice square so it doesn't block the development of any other pieces so some people so queen h4 would walk into bishop e7 queen f3 would blunder the pawn queen d3 does everything queen e3 would obstruct the bishop queenie two would blunder the pawn we could sacrifice the pawn but i'm not really in the mood for that i want to keep things simple and white is slightly better here we have the two bishops black's position is also super solid so this is going to be a um thank you so much tricky this is going to be a long game and we got to be very patient here so let's where should we bring our bishop this is where things get a little bit tricky so bishop f4 is where i know a lot of people want to put it but let's consider what he does after bishop f4 he goes bishop d6 and he trades off another pair of pieces and i don't want to give away my two bishops so that's where i say not every one of your pieces needs to be devising a way to distribute the kobe vaccine we just developed the bishop is the bishop amazing not necessarily but it's perfectly decent on d2 it's still controlling the diagonal and at least we preserve our two bishop advantage i know some people are thinking it's passive but remember that peace placement for the most part is temporary um it's okay to have one of your pieces not be it at its maximal activity uh at any given point in the game so let's go a4 now to grab some space on the queen side and then you can see in case he castles queen side we'll kind of be prepared to to attack him with pawns we're sort of preemptively trying to discourage him from castling queenside picasso's king side this move will still be healthy because we've grabbed some space on the queen side nothing wrong with that at all he he actually raised our queen who can tell me what we should do in this position it would be a nice idea here to reposition the queen to get out of the x-ray where should we put it yeah rockefeller was possible also yeah queen queen f3 is good yeah queen if the queen g3 would bond to the queen queen c3 would be a little bit awkward i'll explain the full decision logic behind this move after the game but um there is also a very specific tactical reason behind this move hopefully he will allow us to explain it he doesn't okay now it would be a good idea perhaps to deploy our bishop through f4 although he can go back to d6 and we might have to bring the bishop back again so how should we defend the spawn instead what would be a very robust way yes c3 defending the pawn with the pawn as i've explained many times that usually is the best way to defend particularly an important pawn we're preserving our advantage we're nurturing it we're bringing our pieces to better squares i wouldn't rush to make a plan here uh let's see how he positions his pieces and that will inform us more about how we should position ours okay so let's unpack this mode for a second he's attacking the pawn the move b3 would defend the pawn but it would also weaken the c3 square so let's play bishop b3 instead because that way we maintain control and we maintain the sort of health ah that's another movie mate i actually missed this move uh but that's okay because sadly we're gonna have to blink queen to d1 bringing our queen back in order to not allow him to take the pawn that's okay the position is robust enough to where uh we don't have to worry about having to make a move like that it's okay uh not ideal and he plays a very very good moment in turn this guy's playing super super well okay so because we have the two bishops we're going to open up the position um but he's got an annoying atm that's actually not that good he's got rook takes d2 as a big threat he's got rook takes c2 has a very big threat um so let's let's do some damage control here we gotta go rookie two we gotta we gotta redefend the bishop of the rook i don't like the fact that he's pinning us but we can get out of the pin with quincy to the next move um he learned from my speedrun right no no white is fine here uh white is completely fine it looks a little ugly it's a little iffy but i don't see a concrete way for him to actually make something of this his pieces are active but we're going to try to push them away now what are what are our ideas here look at this h7 square very carefully what idea can you propose guys to try to exploit that square being weak and to try to exploit our queen being on c2 bingo we can reposition our bishop to b1 creating a battery now you guys might look at this what's the utility of that battery if the knight's defending that square well that ties down his knight and i've explained on several occasions that tying down one of his pieces could be good both positionally tactically he takes it out of the game and also it creates the potential for tactics that exploit the knight and i could get overloaded imagine that he assigns the task uh the knight another task an overloading tactic could result from a situation like this that's another really really good move let's get our bishop to e5 let's try to remove that knight from the board so our queen could gain access to the h7 square hopefully everything i'm doing is making sense okay so he's probably going to do this uh we're not going to make a dryer let's bring our bishop back to c1 for now let's let's uh take a take a chill pill and let's see how he positions his pieces let's continue trying to get this knight off the board uh that's basically what this game revolves around okay so we can make a marginal improvement to our position by doubling rooks just bringing this rook to a slightly better square uh g4 would be two weakening i will after the game spell out my logic in this position but i'm trying to explain every move for now we're just trying to make small improvements to our position ultimate goal is to get the knight off of f6 if we can so now bishop e3 he'll again play bishop c5 so his bishop acts as kind of the gatekeeper but one thing we can try to do here is um well we can try rookie three rook f3 but then he's gonna play bishop f4 again um so let me think okay let's hm let's push our pawn for now let's get this pawn to a square where it's more advanced and we can protect that pawn with b3 and the idea of c4 b3 is dual what idea do we have by playing this what idea do we now have it's appeared because as a consequence of the move c4 bingo bishop b2 and finally it looks like he's gonna have some trouble keeping that knight on f6 now it might seem like no big deal to you guys who might play g6 but g6 is a very weakening move that in and of itself creates potential for tactics also we can just take the pawn on h6 bishop b4 is super strong because now if we if we play the ship e2 he meets it with rook to d2 uh this guy is playing very very well and it's an honor to have viewers like these on my stream but let's not forget about an old idea what old idea now seems to be quite possible because his bishop no longer has access to the f4 square what what idea now becomes very plausible okay so bishop c5 he wants to meet bishop b2 with bishop d4 man not letting us get through but let's tickle him with bishop f4 and okay let's repeat let's repeat moves now we need to find a way to make another marginal improvement to our position how do we make a marginal improvement now one thing i want to make very clear is that um okay we can go rookie five we can centralize the rook and we can tie his bishop down okay so he blunters upon and that was the idea my idea was to tie his bishop down to the c5 square to overload his bishop so that the bishop could no longer gatekeep the knight okay rook two b and now we can get our bishop out to a better square his rook is kind of tied to the back ring because if he moves it away yeah that's right get back now can we put this rock in a protected square can we put this rope in a protected square so we don't have to deal with or we can be protected we can protect it with a move before in the interest of time we're gonna have to play a little faster now we can go rook b5 not rook a6 that would have led into a discovery oh that's a good move but here a little tactic he's attacking two pieces at once what can we do rogue takes b6 malcolm you're the best there should be three ah but he takes but now we have a passport man this guy play this game like a gm the queen e2 now it's equal i missed that in the end but in the time scramble you have to make the decision that okay now i'm going to play fast and he blunders the knight and finally and he blown his door so he collapses here in the end amazing game by exo stark that was a really really interesting game in general it can teach us a lot about positional play good game your game sir um okay so in time pressure heat collapse in the end now let's unpack this we're going to skip the opening the opening was very normal i got a slightly better position here it just takes the queen back to d3 so in this position right every other move would have a drawback we need 5 would walk into bishop d6 queen e2 or de1 would blood of the pawn i could have considered sacking on e2 um queen f4 would block the development of the bishop and walk into d6 queen h4 would walk into bishop e7 creating a nasty pen and if we unpin ourselves yeah i don't want to create the situation right so instead let me open up a new instance of the game we play queen d3 it does everything it doesn't block the bishop it defends the pawn and it lets the rook occupy the open file h6 bishop d2 bishop f4 allows bishop d6 this is the thing a lot of people they automatically choose the most advanced square for the piece that's what i want to get people not to do as much of especially at a higher level it's not all about a piece controlling maximum amount of squares you also need to consider where your opponent is going to put his pieces and if there's something you want to try to preserve such as the two bishops that's exactly where a move like bishop before could be bad because trading the bishops removes the two bishops on the board we no longer have an advantage thank you matt you're welcome okay so he castles rook 81 welcome exo start good great game man amazing performance thanks and um basically okay so rook a1 bringing the rook and why didn't i play rook f1 well to be honest with you guys i thought that in the future i might have a plan associated with f4 f5 uh breaking down his e6 pawn and opening up the diagonal for the bishop this by the way is a very typical plan in these positions there is one small problem if we actually go f4 here which way is black going to castle and i can even show you guys a game of mine where i applied this particular idea with a lot of success against a good player like this f4 f5 idea when the bishop is on c4 you guys should consider castle's queen side that's the good thing about being flexible that's the great and it's like going second in a concert you know you're in a piano concert uh the first guy sets the bar and then you know exactly where you can how well or badly you can play uh that's why i would never like to go first it's the same principle here right we wait for white to show his plan and then we're like jokes on you you weakened your king and f5 is not as strong because black's king is not a g8 anymore he can just go e5 and uh the fact that the bishop is now open is not as effective does that kind of make sense so for that reason uh i kind of regretted this a little bit i go a4 grabbing space rook d8 queen f3 now what is the rationale behind putting the queen here there's a very specific reason and that reason connects with stopping him from castling stopping him from castling why what tactic do we now have well sacking my rook would not produce sufficient attacking chances bishop h6 overloaded pawn i mean takes f6 once upon this is a simple overloading sacrifice so he drops his bishop back i was quite impressed with exo stark's ability to detect tactics here he didn't miss any of this now we go c3 defending the knight defending the pawn queen a5 now bishop b3 this is where i think i made a mistake i think in retrospect it might have been a good idea to sack the spawn play a move such as rookie five basically go for uh basically go for a position like this where his queen is out of the game and um awesome marches major congrats fantastic getting into mit is no laughing matter that's awesome then uh and very happy for you glad you're celebrating by accompanying me on the stream basically uh this produces some compensation i i honestly missed the move queen b6 now we have to drop our queen back and precisely at this moment he opens up the center which leads to a pin now if we escape the pin immediately he has rook takes d2 the queen is overloaded and he's got two pieces for a rook for that reason we have to defend the bishop first now we bring the queen away rook d7 bishop a2 deploying the bishop to b1 now is the next stage of the game the battle here revolves around whether we'll be able to get his knight out of f6 every single move in the next 20 moves revolves around whether i can get this knight away that's what i'm trying to do with bishop f4 he stops me with bishop d6 stops me with bishop c5 otherwise bishop d4 bishop c1 and i decided okay let me keep this bishop here find a new way to do it we get our rook to a good square b5 i thought was a little unnecessary because it allows us to create a passpond which we advance and the reason we advance it is also because of bishop b2 is now an idea our opponent stops it by getting active if bishop b2 then bishop d4 you guys can see like we're both trying to posture her position and um he's kind of keeping the gate closed to his knight this is where i think i found a very nice move rook e5 um rookie five kind of pins his bishop to his pawn activates my rook and he blunders with bishop of d4 what should a black of which black i've done maybe bishop b4 i think that now the rook obstructs our path to the knight this is completely fine for black probably quite equal and after rook takes a5 bishop f4 uh a blunder by me rook v5 allowing this fork and i i should have probably not gone before kept the pawn chain attacked and just gone rook b5 enjoyed my extra pawn uh and uh yeah why is up upon here black is not in any huge trouble i mean the game continues but v4 created a weakness on c4 that's a type 2 undefeated pawn which he immediately immediately exploits and ultimately i forgot that he can take the pawn black is completely fine here it's a drawn position and it's just unfortunate that finally in temperature xo blunders with g6 i think black can go knight d7 or something and go knight e5 and uh black is black is on the positive end of a draw here so why was pawn 85 such a good move i mentioned it was good in the game um the reason this one was good well let's say he doesn't play fight let's see he plays e6 could somebody string together a sequence of moves remember what the battle revolves around watch you guys five bucks from young turns thank you remember what the battle revolves around don't worry uh the battle revolves around me trying to get my bishop to one of these two squares and that would allow me to do the b4 knocks the bishop away from c5 and now what becomes possible again pay attention think about the ultimate goal here bishop where there should be three bishop d4 bingo and black is in trouble because i kind of want to take in goku nation that's not the end of the world but this creates a lot of pressure on black now if he goes g6 uh i talked about this move weakening his position what specifically becomes possibly here white has a beautiful tactical idea uh that exploits the fact that this f7 pawn is overloaded people should see that this pawn is overloaded it's defending two other pawns and we can exploit that with a rucksack this idea is quite typical i can find you many many instances of exactly this kind of tactic appearing on the board in fact i can do that right now i can find something very very similar in in some game um using chessbase's position search feature here's a good example of that happening one second okay now you should see the game so this is just a random game uh but hold my beer yeah but essentially what does black i want somebody to find white's move in this position first and foremost what is white's move here i qualify yes yeah this should be one first and black goes g6 now what should you notice in this position what possibility should you notice and and that doesn't mean you should make that move but you should at least be aware that the possibility of rook takes e6 exists b takes a5 by mr schmidt super clever move look at this little rascal ah i blundered a3 oh my god jokes on you rook take c6 black waters what should black have done in this position instead how should black have permanently ended this idea and rook takes c6 up a piece and white won the game bishop f5 is correct so awareness is one of the keys to tactical success a lot of people solve problems and they say i still blunder i still miss this stuff well you also need to set you need to open up that metal detector you need to make observations before a tactic happens that allows you to prevent blunders right if you've noted to yourself ah i need to watch for this on every move at least for a couple seconds you're less likely to miss me takes a3 rook takes c6 and y wins very simple but uh nonetheless quite instructive okay now you guys will not forget this idea so this is similar okay so that's why a5 is good and uh there were more there's more to talk about in this game but i also want to keep things dynamic i hope that this more or less makes sense yeah why didn't checkmate him um oh yeah can i show the checkmate after the rucksack let me just show you guys another example of this perhaps a little bit less um ah let me show you guys a slightly different variation on the theme game between two very good players 2200 against 2200 white to move who can find the move for me take your time guys i need to take another i need to pee again i just had a jar of coffee now i'm peeing and i'll grab some more water so give me a moment guys i'll be right back what's the move e6 is the move okay we want to disattach the f7 pawn from the g6 and look up even further we got more subs let's look at the let's look at the move so the idea of the movie stakes is to disattach yeah let me let me finish the water i forgot to get water oh my god uh dis attached the f7 problem from these six months to the roof take c6 rookie 6 fp6 we need to combine two concepts back to the game guys thank you so much to siebes appreciate it and just part with the prime we need to we need to combine two concepts i've talked about concept number one is the wish list what do we want to achieve from a general perspective like what is the general thing that we want to have happen now we need to understand how we need to go about this a lot of people are saying the most tempting word which is knight h6 but white finds i think the best way to instantiate this because here's the thing the bishop is a nice defender if we go into h6 and you calculate this it's actually not that simple after bishop g7 there is no direct checkmate so what loudoner thinks is okay i need to do this but i need to get the bishop away from f8 and so how do we do that and i need to play with tempo you can't just go anywhere bingo you guys see the logic behind this now if black takes the king is a lot more alone and so the move bishop takes g5 creates unstoppable threats against black schema here here this is just completely winning so basically uh frosh ghost queen f6 gives up a piece and he lost ultimately that is what black has to do but 96 is the concept of finding the best execution right finding the best execution knight h6 97 check by the way also bad because it gets lets the queen into the defense so very very precise play and that's another way to instantiate these concepts but let's go back to the speedrun i know everybody's anxious for the next game the finish after bishop d6 well i mean why not knight d6 first well because because remember you haven't completed the aim of disattaching this pawn from this pawn so black can just take the knight the move over here is really important charlie and i will be talking about that on monday yeah so how exactly does checkmate happen here well for example if this should be seven then that covers the escape square this is made if queen e8 then we go queen h6 and i call this kind of rolling out the red carpet what do we roll the red car actually we don't even need the red carpet we just made it like this bishop h7 was also possible if king f7 here then bishop g6 wins um could you have gone knight d6 before e6 no because bishop takes d6 and again this position is good for white but it's not winning right does that make sense if you go e6 now remember as my coach would say this isn't checkers black doesn't need to take anymore knight f8 black defends the pawn black is up a piece yeah i know that's what you guys are thinking but remember taking is not forced here taking is a lot more forced because white is also going ef and uh and this is just crushing you know that makes sense okay uh let's get back unless there are any more questions let's get back into the speed run another huge shout out 50 gifted from t seeds and uh yeah knight just uh gets out well what about gf yeah so gf um well basically white achieves the same effect here of weakening black's king so i think he takes f5 is the idea composition one and two thank you and after knight f6 queen g6 is checkmate because the rook obstructs the queen the king's escape thanks for another sub levy invented the phrase well this it's a russian phrase and levy did not invent it i didn't invent it it's existed for many many years it's like a typical russian chess phrase this is also made you just drive the king into the corner and you checkmate him like this um okay so the rook sack okay guys let's move on i've already shown the mate after the rook sec what yeah i know there are specific questions but i think you guys get the gist of it at the new strategy i think you guys get the gist of the line i don't want to bog ourselves down too much into the actual uh sort of the the details [Music]
