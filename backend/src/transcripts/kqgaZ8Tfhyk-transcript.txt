[Music] all right i'm going to play my sub heroic sharkboy so this is my mod oh and cole 385 gifted holy smokes my mind is blown right now okay let's go c5 so we're gonna play like a sicilian structure against one one b3 and now um oh my god josie miku with the 64 party raid let's develop our knight and let's control more of the center with d5 okay so this is a reverse nimzo indian and how should we deal with this pin how should we deal with the spin thank you guys so much appreciate it amazing so queen c7 but remember the rule when you can use a lesser value piece rather than a queen that is generally a good idea so what is the simplest not every one of your pieces needs to be distributing the kovan vaccine bishop d7 is the simplest now we need to get this bishop out we have two ways of doing that the move g6 i'll show this after the game is a little bit dubious on account of bishop takes f6 uh and that kind of ruins our pawn structure in a way that i don't want so let us play e6 and eventually no we're gonna play a6 but there's no russian playing a6 now let's go bishop out to d6 that is the more active square you see that he took on his own volition now we don't want to let well we actually really do so let's hm so this is a really interesting position knight be free gifting to jesse miku how can we ensure that this knight leaves e5 and this is a move that i need to spell out after the game because explaining it now would take me a little bit too long but we're going to play the move knight out to d7 we are basically going to try to force a trade now i know a lot of you are thinking wait a second this blunders the pawn what are you doing what are you doing okay but give it a chance because if he takes that pawn he opens up the g file and that basically gives us massive attacking opportunities so this is better than queen c7 because there white can play f4 and cement the knight he plays f4 anyway but guess what now we can simply take the knight anyway and then our queen could potentially access the g5 square which has been opened up as a consequence of him taking with the f1 we always need to ask ourselves that question when the position has transformed substantively as i've argued time and time again we ask ourselves okay how has the position transformed at go watches to your wondering thank you what should we do now that was a bit of a blunder that was a bit of a blunder look around the whole position take on e3 and now um should we take on d4 yes or no should we take on d4 what do you guys think so here holy smokes edca watches oh my god 25 who is this man we got more hype we should because we destroy his pawn chain again after the game i will guide you through the exact logic but wait a minute wait a minute we got 25 from ecco watches who is this guy he's on fire oh my god guys i can't believe this it just happens every day now and i'm you will bring me to tears eventually this is unbelievable okay but we got a game to win and i think that's what he wants from us so let's castle we gotta complete our develop we gotta complete our development okay let's not forget about that now can you guys propose a way to simply improve the position what is a sort of a typical classic move in such a position to improve the position well it's too early for f6 yeah rook c8 okay to see it now we're leaving this rook on f8 for a very specific reason later we might want to play okay so he goes recovery that's a good move now this pawn we don't need to worry about that pawn is irrelevant in a minute oh 17 from innovative panda this is unreal un freaking real we're going to bring our queen back for the defense of the f7 pawn over protection and now we are ready for a particular kind of move well we'll see this is unbelievable thank you innovative for 17 i mean you guys are something else absolutely something else okay let's go b6 for now let's go b6 and blunt blunt the bishop okay so actually this i haven't played this ideally i think i'm okay so we need to change up the position we need to give our pieces some air how do we pump up the air on the king side what move i previously mentioned this move we rejected it previously but now it's time for this move and that is the move f6 and the way i would encourage you guys to think about this is we just kind of we get some air to breathe on the king's side so g6 i'll talk about after the game as well thanks again both of you you're freaking beasts you're freaking beasts okay edcawatches says i gotta go no problem thanks man for the 25 you are a boss and you can shoot me an email by the way uh though and three bucks from naino also so knight f6 of course we don't want to play gf okay what now what do we do how do we how do we close down the e file we're actually do we have anything oh we have something sexy we have something sexy guys okay oh actually no we don't we don't we don't knight chief i thought it was 94 is the move yeah yeah i thought we had something cool forget it it didn't work i'll show you guys after the game what i thought let me write this down but i am starting to hallucinate okay so we're up upon we have a past pawn on e4 and what he's just done is he's moved the rook away from f1 how should we exploit that how do we do that what should we do in order to explain that we should do is double the rooks right we should double the rooks because he's removed the rook from the f-file which logically means and now let's go e5 intercepting the bishop not letting it get to us and now we can oh no he can't because of queen c4 winning the bishop so let's first go let's cover some ground here with a move let's go queen e6 stopping queen c4 controlling the square centralizing our queen and then we are going to complete the doubling of it rooks i have to give credit here to shark he's defending very very well but uh you guys should be able to see into sense that the position is starting to slip away from him i think okay so here i'm not sure about this actually let me think so let's go rook c7 let's defend everything and then we can swing the rook around to f7 oh my god oxy time gifting 10 freaking subscriptions this is unbelievable oxy time now getting into the party another 10 subs you guys are crazy i'm just saying that h6 to create the uh the little hole for a king now we gotta go rook h7 we might get there tonight at this rate this is unbelievable yeah so i'm playing a little bit faster because of the um because of the um time constraints but i'll i'll spell everything out after the game so what i'm going to try to do here is just talk the king away tuck the king away and everything is going to be easier with the king tucked away now we're going to intercept the queen's control over f1 and we're going to tempt him into taking on a7 which may be good um okay king h2 is really really good man shark is playing incredibly well here as well my opponents today gotta give them credit rook f6 i'm trying to get the rook over to g6 in order to contest that other rook okay now oh my god man rubbish banana subs flying in holy smokes ravaged banana min you're you're crazy man five and five oh my lands girls and boys this is crazy absolutely freaking insane and i might lose this game that let me focus here for a second this is amazing guys 66.71 okay let's go e3 let's open up the position now let's go bishop e4 yeah shark is playing this ridiculously well thank you so much min thank you ravage banana this guy is a beast that is why he's my mod and that is why he's my friend he's good as hell okay let me go here this is actually a draw now but i'm gonna try to win this oh my god cash flow real he's throwing them in the subs are coming in oh god this is bad this is very bad ladies and gentlemen i'm going to lose this you draw good job shark amazing game amazing game by shark no come on but but you played really well don't don't be down on yourself for not winning that that was incredible that was incredible uh that was a great fight cash flow real thanks for the 10 gifted that's my first draw actually um that is my freaking first draw amazing okay so lots happened here lots happened here i think i was better for most of the game but um but that was uh incredibly played so okay so we can check uh yeah lost only three rating points for that b3 can't lose that's right look at the accuracy okay this is this is okay guys look at this freaking look at this this is called this is called effort from both of us you believe that well well well well well well okay that's that's some uh that's some effort yeah back and forth we went so basically like there's so much to unpack here i'm excited about this now let's unpack this for a second so basically um basically basically this one was good okay this man is gonna be a gm one day so okay so this is normal bishop d7 okay bishop d7 yeah i actually have before essentially essentially ensuring that bishop c6 is not gonna double our pawns okay e6 now g6 is also possible but then bishop takes f6 yeah that forces us to take this way and now white strikes in the center with c4 so you know this is um this is very undesirable so e6 d3 bishop d6 shark takes it and goes 95. okay now queen c7 is kind of the typical move but the problem here is he goes f4 thanks again guys for uh for the subs incredible almost 6700 i can't believe it okay anyways i'm really hyped right now so f4 defends the knight and what i want you guys to see is that uh it's very hard now to dislodge this knight so knight d7 basically forces the knight out of e5 now if knight takes c6 and bishop takes g7 right this is i think what would make a lot of people hesitate i ruled this out intuitively like my understanding here was that okay go rook g8 and look at the pieces aimed at the king side what move would combine this and create an attack like can you guys give me an example of a good move here which and to be fair i don't think that maybe black has full compensation objectively but something like queen h4 or queen g5 all of these are good yep so queen g5 for example inducing g3 and black can always cast along yes castling long contains its own risks but this is all about buying yourself time buying yourself time uh in order to continue the attack this gets very very messy this is a typical narrative bs sacrifice but you guys get the rationale now so f4 okay so takes takes queen g5 and here shark makes a mistake d4 is i think the only mistake of the game and and and this of course allows me to take on e3 which is kind of undesirable and instead i think that the move probably queen f3 was to be preferred attacking f7 and only after castling something like d4 i think the position is about equal here although black maybe goes f6 and because white is not developed i think black has the initiative that's how i would phrase it but after d4 queen e3 the reason i took on d4 is because this if you guys think about it is a pawn chain what i just highlighted is a pawn chain how do you deal with plunging you try to undermine the bass and here i literally have a chance to immediately destroy the pawn train so i figured okay this creates another weakness on e5 and this weakness is gonna be hard to defend so queen e2 castles knight c3 and here i actually think i made perhaps a mistake i'm not sure where exactly i went wrong but it was somewhere around this plane that sharks started playing incredibly well rook f3 is a really good move rook f3 is a really good move because this sends the rook to g3 and it prepares the double rocks all of a sudden i realize my king could end up being in some trouble if the rook is lifted to g3 how would we refer to the bishop on d4 what does it have a lot of time guys to use our con to use our vocabulary to go full circle what does it have a lot of potential wow potential energy exactly and it has a lot of potential entry because the moment this pawn is gone the moment it's gone the bishop is gonna be the greatest beast in the world it is also a bad bishop defending a good pawn which essentially means that it has potential energy that is why i was discouraged from playing f5 although this is the computer stop move f5 on poissant and now black has a move that i missed could anybody spot it what intermediate move does black now have to kill the potential energy of the bishop to kill its potential energy and that is the move e5 not being afraid of anything like this because if rook takes f3 and e takes d4 so this would have been i think my biggest chance at a big advantage but i dropped the queen back now doubling rooks b6 and rook h3 just continuing the attack f6 is correct and now rookie three now the sexy move that i thought that i have is knight to g4 the line that i calculated was the following rook takes up okay so if queen takes g4 then it's checkmate so rook takes f8 happens and again if queen takes g4 then this is checkmate but white has this move what do you guys think that i hallucinated when calculating this line what idea quick select another sub with prime thank you sir yeah and i thought oh rook f1 bishop g1 knight f2 checkmate it is check daniel so this doesn't work that is why we have to cover up the e file with knight e4 so take stakes okay now the bishop covers the pawn and my bishop now has a lot of potential energy so we have a reverse of fortune reversal of fortune regards to the bishop now my bishop has a lot of potential energy the moment the rook moves away from e3 i have to consider the move e3 opening up the diagonal okay i hope i'm making sense in the way that i'm looking at this position so rookie one doubling rooks e5 to kill white's bishop queen a6 is really strong and what shark did really well here is he continues to find counterplay in every type of position rook d1 getting the open file h3 and now very patient h3 a4 improving the position a5 wouldn't f8 have defended a7 um in which position oh you mean here well the problem is uh no because this is not made you have to understand that there's bishop g1 that is the issue right bishop g1 is a very nasty move and now white is threatening checkmate that's why i saw the need to defend a7 h6 to stop rook d to take the sting out of it and okay so here rook five to f6 i'm trying to go to g6 to eliminate the rook but rook d8 comes i decide to exploit the weakening of the first rank but queen c8 is super strong because this force is a queen trade and a queen trade is good for white why because now white's bishop is a lot stronger than my bishop my bishop is still staring at the pawn white bishop is multitasking it's being a beast and it's blockading my own bishop so an end game leads to a clear disparity in white's pieces being more active than mine and even though i'm technically still up upon look at how weak all of these pawns are and shark just mows them down bishop c5 i'm not sure about this lets me open up my bishop but still he continues to mow down the pawns takes takes in this position black is the one fighting for equality now i was able to maintain equality this is just a draw and ultimately we ran into a time scramble so i'll skip the rest of the game here but really an incredibly played middle game by shark i think i played quite well as well but but such a rich game so many things happen here so many concepts that we can that we can observe here so after h6 couldn't he have played bishop takes h6 well remember there is a queen here the queen actually defends the pawn and what devronicus is saying okay pawn takes is not possible because of the pin but there is a queen on e6 guarding that square okay is that clear the analysis said he made a blunder well i think the blunder white's only mistake i think was giving the pawn i'm not sure where i went wrong i think most of my moves were very sensible um i think somewhere here maybe i i didn't find the most decisive way to act uh and i think well as i indicated before f5 on move 17 i think was the cleanest path to a big advantage because yeah because if white doesn't take on passant then i get air to breathe for my pieces i can go rook f7 i don't have to worry about my king i can sort of relocate my focus on other sides of the board um and what i missed was this movie five right missing these tactics oftentimes what decides the game at this very high level if that makes sense let's play push to pawn let's go we are black again so that's fine with me oh the uh things are misaligned one sec i don't know why it's so misaligned but let's play an opening called the chagorn yeah i'm not sure why it's so misaligned guys i don't know what happened this is really annoying yeah not sure what happened here sorry guys one sec please yeah why don't we just ignore this for now um so he plays a london system well by the time i correct this i'm actually going to lose on time which is kind of ironic i'm not sure where my time is okay there we go okay so let's take it let's take it no no i wanted you guys to see the time so this is the london system and uh we will just develop our pieces here there is nothing really to write home about just developing our pieces now what would be a good way to develop this bishop who can propose for me a nice little like what are the two possibilities here for developing this bishop obviously the first one is e6 but let's fianchetto the reason i want to fianchetto and i don't want to close off the diagonal for this bishop and there is a very specific reason why i didn't want to develop the light squared bishop first there is a very specific reason why i didn't want to develop the light squared bishop first which i will explain after the game it related to weakening this b7 pawn so we solved the problem by first fiance we can even pre-move castling here we're basically gonna castle against anything other than bishop a6 and my headphones just died so you guys will have to not hear the move sounds for a little bit like freaking headphones constantly i'm dying now here's the interesting thing um i'm going to make a move which to a lot of you guys will seem very bad and it will seem very bad because it ruins the kingside bond structure what move am i thinking of who wants to tell me the move that may seem to ruin the king side pawn structure well it's not h5 it's actually bishop f5 and you guys might be looking at this and saying what girl what are you doing you're opening up the king side but here's the thing there's a couple extenuating circumstances if he takes on f5 and let's hope he does i get very good control of the center particularly the e4 square number one number two because i fianchettoed my bishop and i have a knight on f6 and my queen is nearby i have a lot of beef on the king's side and white doesn't really have attacking prospects it's hard for white to get a lot of pieces into the king's side quickly i'll show this after the game but uh this is a very typical move in these positions i'm sure even this position exactly has occurred before so you shouldn't be afraid necessarily to play a move like this um and and you want to tie this into the concrete circumstances on the board the higher rated we get the more concrete our considerations have to become okay yeah people say i sound better with the headphones off okay so he attacks the pawn now there is a very interesting subtlety here if we go queen to d7 first of all if we go b6 actually let's just go b6 i don't see why not i was a little bit concerned about uh removing the defender on my knight but we can always defend it with rook c8 so i really don't see the problem in this and now we can position our knight on e4 we can also beef up the pawns by going e6 and and sort of securing everything here a little bit further knight a5 is also possible although i don't want to keep that knight on the rim but in the future we can absolutely play knight a5 let's see what he does it really depends on how white decides to play this okay so knight bd2 let's first of all go e6 let's secure these pawns we don't have to rush with the move knight e4 that's not really going anywhere yeah we that's actually one of the key long-term plans of going king h8 rook g8 and repurposing this seeming deficiency on the king side actually in our favor you'll find that this commonly happens right it seems like this benefits white but the reality is this open file what we call a semi-open file because there's only a pawn of one color on the file and it happens to be a white pawn which benefits black here because we are the ones who can get the rook to g8 and begin attacking operations thank you tricking nine for the prime getting us closer to that 30 freaking 6700 i have trouble even saying that number freaking ridiculous thank you sir candidate master is correct so he's burning a lot of clock here 95. now how do we deal with this situation do we take on e5 what do you guys think if not what do we do if yes why so the problem with the move like knight back to e7 is that it leaves white tonight on an outpost and we don't want the knight on an outpost not every one of your thought processes has to be incredibly complex some sort of rocket science knight on e5 is active we're taking it now where is this knight going where is this knight going there's several schools of thought about how to yeah beautiful little outpost now if he takes it we play f e and we get this like wedge in the center i don't know how else to define it we get this really nice you know massive pawns in the center we can then play f6 and remove his last pawn from the center he goes knight f3 for that reason now what plan can we now fall back on i've described this plan before this plan was proposed what can we start to do now that we've sort of established everything in the center this pawn is actually helping us because it's drying things up and it's it's making it very hard for white to actually get anything done so kha now actually i made an inaccuracy i should have made a prophylactic move let's see if my opponent exploits it well let's see if my opponent is able to exploit it but i actually think i should have played the move rook to c8 stopping c4 i think white should play c4 here and actually try to open the position up to distract my attention from the king side not an easy move to play though i mean this takes some serious understanding and he's burning way too much clock right now although even then we will just take the pawn and proceed with our plan with rook g8 i don't really mind the d file getting opened i'm going to take on c4 i'm guys this guy is honorable most people who watch my stream are honorable i'm not going to assume that people are stream sniping okay that goes against my philosophies even if he is big deal all right now he prepares c4 so he has the right idea but i think the execution is a little bit too slow what should we do how do we stop c4 and i just mentioned this move those of you who are attentive should should uh have no trouble with this move rookie now queen c7 right guys again remember the rule the queen we are going to leave for the king side we need to use the least valuable piece for this kind of stuff now what do we do how do we continue our plan so we need to be very attuned to the opportunities that have presented themselves as a result of his last move we don't just put our head down and say rugged rook g8 we need to be very careful okay what is now possible he's like wait a minute the knight has left the king side that means there are certain squares such as h4 which are now available to our pieces queen h4 is so much stronger than rook g8 because it brings a piece in with tempo that's a golden opportunity and then when we do play rook g8 there might be hell to pay here for white so right let's go rook g8 he's probably going to go f3 and then we're going to start looking for tactics and there's a couple of beautiful ideas there okay let me calculate something if you guys don't mind give me a second please hmm yeah there's an idea that doesn't quite work okay but um yeah so so i was thinking about sacking uh with bishop h6 and basically just throwing everything at him but i'm going to make crazy argument guys there's no need for that there is no need for that where can the knight sink its teeth into where it literally the only way i describe it sink its teeth into g3 okay now we want to open up the g-file we do that by repositioning the bishop to h6 now we start looking for tactics that relate to the g-file white is completely busted here and now ladies and gentlemen we what is a very simple way of nurturing the advantage how do we increase the pressure down the g funnel simple simple chess bishop f4 is a great move but i want yeah double the works let's bring all the beef in bring in the beef hashtag bring the beef double them baby girl double them baby now we have ideas like queen takes h3 which we have to consider now we can bring the bishop into addition page form methodical prepare slowly attack fast that's the key prepare slowly attack fast now we look for tactics and do we find them let me think guys for a second i want to find a nice way to win the game in style i am failing to do so hmm let me think yeah we're gonna go 92 and queen h3 that is the simplest i was trying to find some sort of fancy line but um this is simple enough and we're completely winning because this is now coming in the game is over so nice game and a simple simple attacking game no crazy stuff but we don't need crazy stuff oftentimes in order to win the game and that was the case here so against the london i really like the move c5 i highly recommend it to people e3 takes takes now this leads to an interesting pawn and balance right uh i have traded my c pawn and i do need to be for white's epon which is kind of an interesting scenario right black has a more more pawns in this in the center but white has this pawn majority on the queen side i don't think this favors anyone in particular this just leads to an interesting structure so now i develop my pieces now g6 so why did i not develop my bishop to g4 dr olano gifting to smucker y shaft thank you sir well the reason is that this leaves the pawn on b7 vaster lee with a prime i drink zero this is not soda this is sparkling water the queen b3 here is super nasty it attacks the pawn on b7 it's actually not that easy to defend it part of the reason it's not easy to defend it is because the bishop on f4 controls b8 so the move rook b8 is not possible here and the move b6 allows bishop b5 now it's actually a very bad thing that the knight has lost its protector okay queen b6 there's takes takes this ruins the pawn structure i don't love these positions because why does the idea of going 95 this layers on some unpleasant pressure so for that reason you want to go g6 yeah queen see it is possible but it's a little bit awkward is what i'm trying to say what i'm trying to say guys is that this is a little bit awkward in 95 much like in my first speedrun game can lead to some unpleasant consequences you remember the job game right you kind of remember just to compare you remember this game right i played 95 much the same ideas bishop b5 becomes possible now if we compare this to this position now i'm on the receiving end of something like this takes takes bishop b5 comes in i want you guys just to see that white is an initiative right that's all i'm trying to argue so g6 skirts the problem by keeping the bishop on c8 rendering queen b3 uh rendering queen b3 useless right rendering queen b3 useless okay so h3 uh stopping bishop g4 now we develop now the main reason we won the game is this new bishop f5 and i want people to really understand this move did this move make sense to you guys and let me just recap um visually speaking okay bob meister says bishop f5 makes zero sense to me bob meister you're gonna be my litmus test i wanted to make 100 sense to you okay great now let's trace what you guys are thinking what i feel like is going through your brain about meister and correct me if i'm wrong you're looking at this move and you're saying girl right look at look at these pawns why are you making this so ugly this is doubled the king is open what are you getting in return for that i'm like well come on like damn girl well here's the thing what you need to look past the visual deficiencies of the pawn structure and you need to look at and specifically notice a couple of things first of all these pawns are combining to increase their control over this very important central square on that central square could appear at night and this is very similar to a lot of variations right you can think about the marotzi bind variation of the accelerated dragon for example same concept two pawns combining to control a square that's just a proven method to increase your control over the center that's like the same thing wearing different clothes but the second thing is that i think you would agree with me the g file gets opened right this is what's called a semi-open file who can benefit from the g-file well clearly black is much closer to putting a rook on g8 and attacking white then white is putting a rook on let's say g3 and attacking black right that's just a fact of chess because your two moves away from getting a rook to g8 the third thing to notice is that even though your eyes are telling you hey this is ugly your brain needs to tell you there's no problem because we can just play e6 and we did and there's literally this pawn is as robust as any right this center is all protecting each other so this is completely and perfectly acceptable does this begin to make more sense when i explain it like that uh bot meister uh no i wouldn't say it's a mistake but i would consider going bishop e2 or or even queen c2 trying to trade on white's own terms right well it's not the white's pieces yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely we're very happy to hear that so b6 here defending the pawn knight bd2 e6 95 we take it and we go knight e4 guess what we're reaping the benefits from our uh our move bishop f5 so very understandably white ghost knight f3 i think white should have taken on e4 now we go rook king h8 i think rook c8 would have been better stopping c4 and here i think the last chance really for white is to go c4 open up the position as quickly as possible distract black's attention after rook d rook d won roxy and we stopped c4 you guys might notice wait a second can't he take nope because this is defended and black is up upon and so knight t4 happens we go queen h4 exploiting the deficiency here here gazda youtube is not lagging behind it's just we're uploading a video a day doing the best we can so paul shows he did do that that that's literally exactly what he did that's what that's what he did if he did it as soon as possible he can't do it here because the bishop is hanging so he does it does it here but it weakens the g3 square that's literally exactly what the problem is um and um well we take toward the center usually now bishop h6 to open the g file double literally everything is very clear he can't take the queen because of the g file pin drop the queen back the next move will be bishop f4 with crushing position why not take e5 pawn asks rockwell i which position rockwell here the pawn is defended by the rook so at no point could i have taken that pawn right here it's defended by that hidden bishop so the pawn is is not takeable unfortunately what if king white king goes to f aids um not sure where well if he goes to oh f1 well then you lose control of the bishop i can just take the bishop so in these positions when all of your pieces are attacking there is just no possible way that that there is a defense to be found can white take the knight with the bishop please tell well yes so he can problem is going to be look at these dark squares right look at look carefully at these dark squares if white now goes f4 what is black's crushing move who can tell me and min i'm almost ready for you if you're still around what you should notice here you look at the rook you look at the queen and say ha if the bishop was gone from g7 it would be czechos how can the bishop move and make the most damage while it's at it boom goes the dynamite white must defend the pawn and in the time that white does that the bishop takes another pawn with the devastating threat of queen h2 white white's position collapses completely does that make sense so but was f3 necessary asks henrik uh dc well i actually think maybe white shouldn't have done that but in my opinion if white doesn't play f3 then my idea is to go bishop h6 and double rooks much like i did in the game i simply do not see a good defensive resource against that because white is no play on the other side of the board that's why counter play is so important because without counter play you simply just you keep nothing you can do there's too many pieces attacking well if he plays g3 then look at this bishop you bury the bishop alive and you give up h3 so rook t3 i'm not sure how that helps bishop h6 i understand what you're trying to do but you just and also knight d2 is a threat forking the queen of the rook right so what you guys are suggesting is putting a band-aid over it but ultimately my pieces are so active that once i double rooks there will be hell to pay regardless of how you try to rearrange your resources you're just too passive knight f3 queen h3 knight f3 you sever the connection between the rook and the pawn i take on h3 okay so you're just not going to win and if king h1 the knight takes f2 too many things have to be taken into account here counter play is an attack that is mounted in response to some sort of pressure or attack counter attack right an attack of your own oh i personally don't really care the computer gives minus two um i don't really care uh okay harshit i encourage you to ask a question only once because i do see it so c4 opens up a file by opening up a file you are distracting in a sense black's attention from the attack right you can play rook a to d1 and attack the queen and at least white gets some activity right in return for defending against the attack all right guys um does that all i hope that all makes sense to everybody i hope that all makes sense to everybody well but meister but but that's a limited you know that's a limited mentality that's a limited or that's a limited limiting belief that i wouldn't play x i encourage people not to tell that to themselves now i'm not all about affirmations and stuff but the thing is when you tell yourself 94.8 when you tell yourself ah i wouldn't find this i wouldn't find that then you're never going to start finding these moves at some point there has to come a time when you are the fir when you first time that you play this kind of move right there there has to be a first time that you play a move like bishop f5 and if you always tell yourself ah i don't have the capacity to play such a move then you never will you at some point you have to you have to be your own biggest cheerleader uh because nobody else will uh at some point okay sorry to preach but that's my opinion okay uh kazvar off because well because because there's no other good square for the bishop like this is not great to fianchetto but fianchettoing in general is pretty solid so you can think of this in terms of potential energy right not every piece needs to be that amazing this is and um the reality is if you go e6 then you block the bishop which i really don't like doing so there's just this is like the lesser evil right and if you develop the bishop then you allow queen b3 well if he doesn't take your bishop right if he goes bishop b2 i think this is the main move actually then you know black has several moves i can go 94 centralizing my knight i can basically start preparing e5 exactly swirls and i i like that uh comparison a lot yes it is but as i am explaining right first of all the bishop has potential energy if this diagonal ever opens the bishop is going to be a beast and that needs to be factored in and also like the bishop is just a solid piece right it's defending certain squares uh you you shouldn't have this one-dimensional view of pieces oh it's blocked by a pawn therefore it's terrible forever uh sometimes it's a necessary evil to develop a piece to a certain square like that sometimes the piece fulfills other auxiliary functions that are harder to define but no less important if that makes sense okay obviously as i've climbed in rating i've sort of really um i've emphasized these these other factors because that's what it takes to succeed at this level um but uh you know if you're like 800 900 then you should try to pull out some of the essentials and not bog yourself down too much of the specifics let's say of this variation if that makes sense yeah so queen c1 bishop h6 is possible but you could go rookie 8 and bishop h8 that's a typical way of defending against bishop h6 well probably i should go to sleep but i could also stream all night and all morning and all day
