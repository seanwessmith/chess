you know in general i do want to experiment with some different openings to show you guys the range of openings but we are white again so let's put that discussion aside against the 2000 and let's once again play the alopin sicilian [Music] this guy plays e6 and d5 probably okay a6 now that's that's a bad move and once again as we know there are several approaches we can develop but what we can also do is we can say you know what sir you didn't play d5 i'm gonna make you regret it by pushing our own pawn up to d5 why are we doing this well staking a bigger claim in the center and stopping his knight from developing to c6 now we don't need to play c4 all right this pawn is safely protected by its neighbor so we can just concentrate on developing the rest of our pieces now okay so he closes up the center using a lot of time to do it and that's actually not that bad of an idea but he hopefully we're gonna make him pay for spending so much time pushing his pawns around now black kind of wants to play f5 here and so so where should we deploy this bishop with an eye toward that where should we move it to e2 no we should move it to d3 and then i know that previously i said we don't need to play c4 but here it might be a good idea to play c4 in order to get get this knight to c3 but we don't actually need to do that even now let's bring our knight over to b to d2 thank you shimoma for the 300. there's a very typical maneuver that allows us to successfully deal with this pin and it involves the knight if you guys play the rye lopez you should be very familiar with this maneuver what am i talking about where is this knight going to go it's going to go to f1 and then it's going to go to g3 now that knight on g3 can participate in an attack should black castle short what it also does is it takes away the h5 square from the bishop now if we play h3 black must either you know shoot or get off the pod bishop takes f3 and in either case he gets rid of the pin for us so we can breathe easy okay h3 it is and uh again we have several approaches approach number one is to say we're not gonna let black expand any further we're gonna make a move such as b4 or a move such as a4 let's try that and undermine his pawns now look at what's going on he can't move his knight out of the way which why is that important that's important because the rook what do you guys notice about it using our terminology what do you guys notice about the rook we're going to drop the bishop back he attacked it is what kind it is it's not trapped that's not really the point there it's undefended it's type one undefended literally completely which means we're threatening to play eight takes b5 forcing him to make the tremendously awkward move bishop bishop takes b5 now his pawns are gonna be horrible now we can complete our development by castling and uh look at this knight on g3 where should it go should it go anywhere should we just chill on g3 what's the idea yeah that's right someone might have absolutely let's bring it to knife f5 and now how about this bishop let's bring it to g5 and now you guys should start to see how we're accumulating pressure on both sides of the board but it's not actually easy black's position is very solid in order to break through on the king side we'll need more reinforcements now when we need more reinforcements we need to take a little survey of our pieces to see which pieces we can activate now what do i see here these two pieces are well placed immediately i see two things that i don't have three is doing nothing and the pawn on f2 we would love to open up that file as you guys are indicating let's kill let's do both things at once knight h2 is a very typical idea in the rye lopez because this knight can come around to g4 in addition i'm preparing the move f4 so we can start by playing knight g4 and f4 is not possible now because of the pin but we can always move our king aside right that's not a big problem so let's complete that first maneuver and try to kill off a defender if he takes on g4 that will help us bring our queen into the game then the storm clowns will really start gathering around black's king okay so we're not doing anything extraordinary we're just attacking in very simple moves with very very straightforward ideas and hopefully he you know sort of starts to collapse a little bit okay so g6 a move like this that's made on the on the side of the board where we're attacking him immediate question we need to ask ourselves what new weaknesses are created as a consequence of this move and you should immediately see that there's a square on h6 which we can stick a knight in the trade is good for us look at these dull look at these dark squares maybe one day we'll give a lobster pincher checkmate attacks prepare slowly attack fast don't expect to checkmate him in two moves i see this all the time players get frustrated because it seems like you're making no progress you are making progress we are making progress it's just slow progress uh we've gotten the dark squares for ourselves we've gotten some pieces in the attack now we sort of start to enter the final stage of the attack which is actually the sort of you know now we got to start looking for specific winning ideas and if you look very carefully we actually have a winning idea how do i find it i would love to deliver the lobster pin to checkmate you guys should see that immediately right it's such a common idea in order to do that we have to get the night out of the picture let's get the night out of the picture again we're moving upon in front of our own king which would disqualify this move for some people but it shouldn't because once again he's got no pieces on the king's side there's no way he can exploit this i think he has to drop his queen back to d8 then we're gonna take the queen transform our advantage from an attack into an extra piece so the attack has succeeded i think i don't see an option for him and what he's done here he's brought his queen to b6 that was his final that was the nail in the coffin because he can he could not have afforded to just move his queen willy-nilly away from the zone of the attack but here let's be clinical here's the thing this guy's tricky if g takes h5 he wants to trap our bishop with g5 now we're easily going to get our bishop out of there but i want to show you guys what precision looks like can we avoid the situation entirely is there is it possible to just not have to deal with this bishop yes it is a good job no he's going to bishop b3 bishop e3 brings the bishop back intermediate move the knight's not going anywhere we're attacking the queen okay uh thank you for that now i think he thinks he can trap my queen because if queen g3 92 check is a fork but the reality is we first of all we can do even that and be up a piece but we can also go queen h6 and save the queen and he resigns smooth game game wasn't smooth enough and uh relatively uneventful now a lot of people as you guys can see don't really know how to deal with the elephant even at the level of very competent 2000s so we go d5 driving in the wedge we develop our pieces we go bishop d3 to prevent or at least discourage him from playing f5 now knight bd2 knight f1 knight g3 the typical rye lopez maneuver now we chase the bishop away undermine his entire pawn chain here on the queen side using the fact that the rook is undefended these are all very typical railopa's ideas now what if he would have taken the pawn and crown jewels asked that at exactly the same time what would we have done had he taken the pawn boom boom we've shattered the defenses around this game but at a grand master level by the way we don't even need to go around on bishop c2 bishop we don't need to rush with this okay and this is a very important point i want to make think of extra material as another man on the man on the soccer field okay 11 players in a soccer game think of extra pawn as okay one side is 10 players but one side could still have lionel messi and david beckham and whatnot uh having a certain number of people on the field doesn't win you the game scoring goals wins you the game and in the same vein having extra material is a passive state that doesn't in and of itself translate to victory it might give you more pieces to attack with ultimately but you shouldn't immediately panic when you sacrifice upon sometimes you're just not in a hurry to recapture it look at this fun it's not doing anything eventually yeah we'll go around and take it we can do that immediately but we can also focus first on developing it has lots on absolutely okay i even saw zlatan once he was in the same hotel in qatar during the tournament so here we go knight f5 bishop g5 very simple attack knight h2 and i'm you know again i can probably produce i can find a game where you saw exactly the same this is exactly what we practiced for exactly the same attacking sequence so i want you guys to look at this sequence of moves knight f5 bishop first the knight transfer then knight f5 bishop g5 knight h2 knight g4 and then bringing the queen in okay remember and sort of hammer this into your head for a second now watch the following game uh not a famous set of players 2150 very competent spanish master playing white 1997 this is an over-the-board game rai lopez i want you guys to predict white's next one two three four five six moves five moves or six moves boom boom boom boom boom boom boom knight f5 bishop g5 knight h2 knight g4 queen f3 okay in exactly the same order too and then he lifts the rook up and he crushes him with a very easy tactic undermining than an f6 okay very specific knight queen f3 the idea is to is to x-ray the knight on f6 and you can see the idea of queen of three revealed on this move because the nano f6 is now just busted king h8 allows knight takes f7 with a fork g takes h6 knight f6 is the game is just over and black resigned because if he moves this queen you simply have queen g4 and checkmate okay so i always get a kick out of how you know similarities work and that's why you should keep your eyes and ears peeled for top level games because you can learn about various tactical concepts and ideas that of course you can apply guys uh i i will not forget the karakan please also be respectful of the openings i decide to play i get you know i have the final say and i'm capable of deciding so i will promise i play the car con but uh you know i've i've noted that down okay so basically we weaken his dark squares queen h4 and now very simple right we want to get this knight out of h5 in order to deliver the lobster pincer mate and um and and uh we do that by playing g4 in order to chase the knight away from h5 what if g6 wasn't played well um i don't really see what he can do because we want to play f4 not on the next move that would be illegal but we have several tactics here i mean black's position is so devastated here that let's say he like plays a random move um we actually can basically kill him immediately could somebody name the tactical idea yeah actually this would be brilliant no knight g7 is better i think knight g7 is better because it blasts open everything if he takes with the king we have a discovery against the king we have a discovery against the king if he plays bishop takes we have bishop h6 and checkmate is unstoppable knight h6 has exactly the same idea he can't take because of the discovery or actually checkmate on f6 and if he moves the king then we wipe the floor with him we can go back to h6 it's kind of like a windmill we're up upon we have a massive attack so you guys can see how when you have an accumulation of pieces like this you know the win is basically imminent so queen h4 g4 and the game is over bishop b3 to drop the bishop back so that he doesn't trap it after g5 yeah so bishop d1 here would would have the same idea as g4 but remember the rule when you can do something with a pawn you usually want to do it with a pawn rather than a piece because here if he goes queen to d8 it wouldn't make sense to take the queen right whereas if we attack the knight with a pawn then we can take the queen pawn takes the knight which means that we're up a piece so in any case well prime time you need to figure out if you have tactics or if you want to get rid of any of your opponent's pieces that's what we did in effect by getting the knight to g4 we got rid of one of his defenders so anyways yeah the light squared bishops were sort of chilling on their respective squares but black was the one uh who paid the price for it black was the one what was the game's accuracy yes let me look uh i'm sure that you know inaccuracies were committed drum roll please 88.4 so but zero mistake zero inaccuracies i don't really know how how it was calculated so yeah i mean he made us look good because no basically most of the moves in the middle game are all we're all best moves yeah bishop e3 was actually not even necessary anyways um let's play one one more yeah the uh accuracy calculation i should say is not like the end-all be-all and when chess.com investigates cheating people think they just look at that number and conclude on the basis of that that is like the absolute tip of the iceberg you know there's like much more complex complex statistics and analytics that are conducted all right so just to point this out to people okay let's continue now we're probably going to be black so maybe i'll have a chance to play the karo khan no we're playing white again i don't know why i'm white in three games in a row and sidsilian's ringing well we've been doing well with the alvin and another e6 and this guy plays the same thing that the last guy just played maybe he's watching the stream maybe he's gonna play the exact same game okay this is getting kind of weird i think he's watching the stream yeah that's i'm pretty sure nope that guy played bishop g4 this guy improves with h6 if this is a coincidence this might be the biggest coincidence i've ever seen but we're not gonna change our okay so he goes g5 all right so i think it's a different guy now the move g5 i see this often at at this level he's trying to intimidate us but what i'm going to ask here is which weaknesses have been created as a consequence of the move g5 and immediately you should spot the f5 square particularly in the context of the last game so it makes sense to conduct the very same plan moving the knight either to g3 or e3 even though we're not dislodging a bishop from g4 now we're accessing the f5 square whoa okay so i'm going to make a very interesting move guys and i'm going to make this move first and then i'm going to explain it later i'm going to go knight to g1 and after the game i'll talk about the concept of retreating which is misunderstood by a lot of people what am i doing my end goal is to get a knight to f5 and in order to get the knight to f5 well i have two goals first is to get the knights f5 the second is to open up the position because he's moved nothing but his pawns okay so i'm going to try to you know accomplish both coals with my next couple of moves knight's e3 now this should make sense to you guys why did i go knight you won why the hell did i go at you could somebody explain to me what this knight could possibly be doing on g1 i'll give you a hint it's supporting a particular type of move it's supporting the move h3 which is conducive to the goal of opening up the center or opening up the position in general here the king side and now we deploy the knight to h3 but aren't knights on the rim grim well they are except this knight has prospects of coming to g5 and i have succeeded in opening up the atrial given the sorry state of his development um this is a a a very positive thing and now my second goal has been accomplished i've gotten the other knight to f5 he can certainly take the knight but guess what i'll take back with the pawn i'll chase away his knight and and i might even drive that pawn down to f6 now normally i've talked about this before you want to make sure that when you establish an outpost on a square you can recapture that outpost with a piece but there are exceptions to the rule and this is an exception because he's so poorly developed that what i'm just trying to do is keep the flames roaring you know and keep the position as open as possible okay this guy's actually not playing terribly i mean his opening is not good but it's not as easy to refute as it seems okay alan t 17 17. thank you for the sub what should we do look very carefully at at the various sort of elements of the position when he's played in such a shoddy manner we need to start looking for ways to go for the kill yeah we have a fork this is a type one undefended pawn right which means that we should actually pay attention to it particularly since we're making contact with it and we can just go around and take it and normally i don't like to go pond grabbing like this but we can totally get away with it here because of our absolute domination development-wise and also we open up the h-file who knows maybe one day we'll checkmate them down that h-file um am i making a prophecy here well maybe okay that h4 how do we deal with this how do we deal with this move which again may look intimidating but we can very easily shut it down so we don't even need to defend the spawn we can just move the pawn up to g3 and the check on g2 is not scary because he traps his own knight he's gonna have to drop his knife back to g6 if i'm considering this correctly okay and now let's deploy our queen and x-ray his king am i worried about the knight on h5 i'm keeping an eye on it because it is also a type 2 undefended piece so if he dislodges my queen from f3 he might win the night but i don't see that happening because of how passive he is i just don't see that happening okay um let me think for a second what should we do well bishop g5 launders a piece so we do want to develop the bishop where should we develop it just develop it to e3 right we don't need to reinvent the wheel here we can just bring it out and we can castle long to link up the rooks which is what we're going to do now we're basically ready to start attacking on the king's side finally we've completed our development now we need to find a way to uh to get things to get the get things going okay let's drop the bishop back he's attacked it and this is no problem right again his entire campaign is running on intimidating us but the reality is he doesn't even have any attackers this move isn't even dangerous so i know a lot of people want to go king b1 or a3 we don't need to do any of that we can basically jump right into the attack against his king with what move we have waited very patiently for this move to appear on the board knight to g5 attacking f7 threatening checkmate much like in the last game if you guys remember we kind of goaded him into giving up control of the dark squares and that's an intermediate step uh because that in and of itself is not going to give us what is going to give us checkmate now is a move like knight f6 we're gonna we're gonna meet him on the dark squares here might have six if he had a bishop would have been easier to defend now he's just collapsing all over the place queen a1 check and always be shut down with bishop b1 not to mention that the king has an open escape on d2 so it takes takes in fact queen a1 check he's probably going to play and what should we do should we go bishop b1 should we move the king okay actually here now we should start looking for mates let me think hmm oh there's a very pretty idea so we need to start looking for patterns and first of all there is a piece that we can put queen h5 is exactly what i'm thinking i'm gonna keep this move shrouded in mystery for the time being hopefully he gives us a chance to uh to demonstrate a very nice concept but you guys can see how close we are to delivering all sorts of mates there's one particular threat which may lay hidden under the surface hopefully he gives us a chance to reveal it okay what should we do now queen king to d2 of course uh attacking the queen and how and here we go guys queen eh yeah this is again if you have that notebook with the themes the attacking tactical themes this is something that you should be very much aware of uh i don't know exactly what it's called but it's it's like an arabian mate or something along those lines no matter where he goes we checkmate him where the knight in the rook come by and the bishop guards the knight nice little idea checkmate we don't actually use the discover check we just made them in the same way so nice hook mate is what it's called very nice okay so a simple game given that he basically did a lot of work for us i still think maybe he was watching the stream um but yeah so essentially what happened so he went g5 and he weakens the the f5 square permanently which is why this move is so terrible and now we get the night over now knight g1 right this move should make more sense uh should make more sense now um in in light of what happened in the game and so what i wanted to point out is that again remember the soccer player's analogy right if you have if you're down material that's not a bad thing if the material you do have on the board is leonel messi type material the same thing goes here the knight on g1 is not inherently bad because it's on g1 the knight is a very specific role and that's why i always advocate to look at pieces in terms of what role they are fulfilling rather than how they look or how many squares they're controlling it is true that when a piece controls a lot of squares it's more likely to be good than a piece that's not controlling a lot of squares but that's far from always the case thank you so much mr alma i appreciate it and this is exactly such an instance because the knight has a very specific role its role is to prepare the move h3 in order to rip apart that h file so that we have that artery eventually to reach us king two things first of all why is it necessary to have the knight on g1 there why can't we play h3 now like can somebody explain to me why h3 is not as effective here and um like why why is h3 not effective here because well because it's covered by the bishop the file is still closed one could argue that the g-file is open but wouldn't you guys agree that the h-pawn is now weak and you know i kind of weaken my own king so it's just not the same but there's a secondary reason that i played nycha which is that eventually if h3 falls through if black finds a way to stop it this knight from g1 can deploy itself to g3 and combine with the other knight on e3 and then both knights would control f5 okay so it's kind of a twisty little maneuver but sometimes you need to go back in order to go forward again i've written an article on this on unchest.com i have a lot of favorite examples where you see moves like knight b1 um and and that's just a very commonplace thing very very commonplace thing the most famous example ever i would say of um one second what was that game was it rubenstein against let me try to remember the game i think it was ruben stein against nimzovich so very famous game 1926. nimzovich of course both of these players are kind of like the founders of modern positional chess and in this position nimzovich played one of the most famous maneuvers of all time now i've hinted at what the first move is but who can tell me not only the first move but what the idea is of this maneuver thank you extrav appreciate the 2am hype guys um building our way toward greater and greater hunts yeah so nimzovich basically notices um nimzovich basically notices the knight on g3 and he says well uh the knight on g3 isn't doing much because i would love to put it on e4 but but that square is controlled i'd love to put it on h5 but it could get chased away with g6 and it's a relatively close position so knights should be good in close positions and what he finds is the move knight to h1 and as the arrows indicate the knight is simply going to g5 now in getting there it's going to have to pass some danger zones right first it comes to h1 a very ugly square and h3 also might look ugly because it's on the rim right but that doesn't matter because ultimately the knight is going to discover the fountain of youth now in the actual game because of the complexities of the game he only put his knight to g5 on move 30 but it came with tremendous effect and he swung his queen back the rest of the game was actually very pretty as well actually tremendously instructed he won a piece and then very fittingly that night end of the game on a beautiful no less beautiful square on c4 we can do a piece path and you guys will see like all of the nice travels but i'll do that later the engine i think likes knight h1 i'm not actually sure but i think it's the top engine move and that's the thing with these games these players were not just like randomly making these moves which we now praise they were actually good yeah so night each one is good it's it's it's one of the top moves it's not as clear-cut as like as perhaps the commentators of the day made them out to be but from a practical perspective it's still incredibly instructive okay so not to make it big not to belabor the point but just wanted to indicate this and so here we go with h3 knight is redeployed and the knight wins us the game okay it's the other night to be sure so knight g7 check knight takes hy wins the pawn get out of here queen f3 deploying the queen completing our development we're not afraid of the attack because black has simply no pieces in the attack and now knight g5 immediately jumping in with the other knight so very similar to nimzovich right the knight from g1 comes out to g5 it's the same actual it's the same square that's actually kind of cool it's the same path in the same square uh nimzobitro's path was knight h1 um it was it was um knight h1 f2 h3 g5 here we go knight g1 h3 g5 immediately so it's kind of cool bishop takes takes dark squares are weakened we swing the knight to f6 and using that h file and using this very famous tactical pattern we deliver the checkmate um okay i i mean by the way the losses uh were deliberate to stabilize my rating one of them was against the cheater that was my only quote-unquote genuine loss and uh yeah so was the draw i think any questions any questions on this game this is made by the way also usually people say that plans require more than three moves shouldn't be pursued well i've kind of said that um i don't know if it's like a common piece of wisdom i know i've advocated that to my students uh so how do i know when to violate this isn't this plan like going to take forever so how do we know thank you for the five bucks dumb tweet uh and again you need to exercise your judgment chess gape artist thank you for the tier one and the reason that i think i can get away with this is because of what he's done in the opening he's pushed only his pawns which means that he doesn't have the firepower necessary to punish me and i can take my time on something right he's done nothing but weaken his positions by the time he he he completes his development that gives me more than enough cushion to orchestrate a plan that in another type of position might have taken too long okay um no i cannot beat stock fish eight and neither can anybody why not queen g4 instead of g3 so well queen g4 would have blotted the queen right that's a it's a little botox gambit never travel or never win a chess tournament again i don't know what to think about that or upon only openings that were viable yes they are it depends so i can show you an example in the alakine defense if black plays knight c6 in this position now the main move is d6 knight c6 is a big mistake white can basically win the game only pushing his pawns for the first like five moves c4 d5 c5 and now f4 and white is winning because he's attacking this knight and he's attacking this knight so there are exceptions but they're rare i mean playing an entire five to ten moves without pushing any pieces out usually not a very good idea thank you zola vagus you're very welcome does that make sense i've never blundered my queen in a real game but i know grandmasters who have um well queen h6 also was winning but less less uh aesthetically pleasing i would say i don't recommend the petrov to anybody below two thousand i think the petrov is too dry yeah queen d4 is fine the alakan defense is more than viable in fact i recommend it to some people the alakan is a very underestimated opening for club players i think there are several chessable courses on it as well so it's one of those very cagey openings that can get you a lot of good positions because people don't study it as much uh the perk less so because in the alakan at the very least black makes a claim to the center relatively early in the perk you really relinquish much of the center so i think the alden is a little easier to play for intermediate players
