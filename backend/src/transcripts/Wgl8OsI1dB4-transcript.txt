[Music] welcome people now let's continue with the next set of games uh because it seems like people are pretty clear okay let's go for 1300 and again let's go e5 beginners can play the sicilian although well i'll talk more about that afterward and he played the king's gambit i know a lot of people are anxious to see how i play against the king's cabin now there's a couple of very interesting options um against the king's gambit that i can recommend to beginners but right now i want to play a variation that illustrates uh the sort of the the point of the king's gamut and various ways we have of playing against now the best thing i like to do against the king's gambit that i would recommend to beginners is to take the pawn and then play d5 what is the purpose of the move d5 the purpose of the move d5 is very simple by playing f4 white has weakened his king side right i mean everybody would agree with me on that and by our principle when our opponent weakens his king side we want to generally open up the center in order to beat more in order to be able to exploit that but we don't want to take this pawn immediately with our queen because as we know we allow the move knight c3 uh which kicks the queen and increases white's lead in development so we're going to play knight f6 here and try to take that pawn with our knight which has two effects first of all we keep our queen safe second of all we actually lend support to that f4 pawn by taking with the knight so he plays d4 that is a very typical mistake knight takes d5 and he cannot take the pawn with his bishop now he continues to develop his pieces naturally that makes sense but we're going to do the same thing right we're just going to play bishop e7 uh which some people might consider to be a passive move but remember we are upon up right i don't need to develop in a particularly active manner you might be looking at this and saying well wait a second he could have taken on d5 and then taken on f4 couldn't he have won the pawn back what the hell are you doing daniel well i will explain that after the game in fact this is in the same theme as the last game we are transforming our advantage i am willing to sacrifice back the pawn that is why the king's gamut is not as effective as people used to think because black can essentially sack the pawn back in many lines and gain in return a set of positional advantages now uh a question for you guys how do we take the sting out of this bishop on c4 it's annoying the hell out of me i don't like the fact that it's x-raying my knight i don't like the fact that there's pressure on f7 what's a good way to just prevent that from happening no definitely not knight e3 that helps him knight e3 helps him right it actually helps him reinforce the pressure so we're going to go bishop e6 a typical development move taking the sting out of his bishop and uh asking him what he wants to do no he can absolutely win the pawn back right he can take our knight and then he can take it upon but what are we going to have in return for that pawn well we're going to have first and foremost the two bishops in beyond whatever we'll talk about that after the game thank you once happens now um the time has come for us to contest his control over the center and there's several ways for us to do that can somebody suggest for me a couple of interesting moves there's many things that we could do here really many now c5 uh is my initial inclination but i actually have stopped liking it and i promise to explain why that is after the game but basically he has c4 in return so what we're gonna do instead is we're going to play knight c6 this is a very this is a five head move okay because what i know some people are thinking why are you why are you making this move why are you ruining your own pot structure like what are you doing uh and i will explain this that's the purpose of the speed run okay but basically we are going to use these c pawns as a bargaining chip right now the c bonds look bad but in reality they're not bad at all they can actually be pushed forward one after the other and they can be used to contest white's control over the center okay i know that that's a bit of a vague explanation uh but i will delve more deeply into this after the game we are a little bit short of time okay so we see c5 now here's the thing if he takes our pawn on c5 that first spot is going to be replaced by another one and now watch what happens watch very very carefully what i do i take the bishop now i will take the pawn on d4 with my queen and once he takes my queen and i take with the pawn i have magically corrected my pawn structure and that pawn on c7 remember what i said the fact that the pawns are doubled can be a good thing because eventually we might get a situation where i've undoubled the pawns and the i have another part of the c file that can be used to support its neighbor on d4 i've got an extra pawn we are in an end game i know some people wanted me to get end games so here we go what do we do in end games like these first and foremost we need to activate our pieces we need to make our pieces the best that they can be so where should this bishop go in order to be the best that it can be yes indeed the second thing that we need to make sure of is that his pieces do not get to active squares this is the part people forget this knight on f3 where does it want to go where does it want to go what active square does it want to reach and how do we stop it from reaching that active square that's all the prophylactic yeah f6 that's all prophylaxis is and you guys can find it we go f6 and we stop his knight from centralizing on e5 in fact robert hess uh my partner in crime he pay he sort of draws attention to this all the time the fact that we have a pawn that is essentially two open squares away from the night that is a very good situation for the pawn okay we're going to drive our opponent crazy he wants to go to f5 that is very clear from his last move can we prevent him from coming to f5 with either the knight or the bishop i will explain everything after the game absolutely we can let's drive them insane we go g6 right and this kind of boa constrictor play is what people hate to see right and this is what people don't do enough of they get they get fixated on their own ideas and they don't stop to ask themselves what their opponent's idea is when you do that uh you often play moves like g6 and he's out of ideas let's continue in the same style he wants to push this pawn and expand on the queen side can we stop him from doing that too even though it's not necessary can we just play in the same spirit yeah a5 okay you see g i'm splaying these moves all the time now this bishop on e6 ladies and gentlemen it's not doing the most that it can do can we put that bishop on a slightly better square let's do it can we put that bishop on a slightly better square folks we absolutely can let's centralize it on d5 now one thing that i want to do here is push this pawn to f4 in order to support this bishop on e3 and essentially the stage of the okay again remember he wants to get his knight to e5 can we prevent that can we now stop him once again from getting his knight to e5 while also improving one of our pieces i mean you can see that i'm playing very gradually i'm not doing anything crazy i am slowly marginally improving my position to the maximum i'm pushing all my pawns up to good squares to support the pieces and i am limiting the mobility of his pieces stopping them from getting to active squares um and eventually how am i going to win i'm eventually going to start doing something a little bit more active one idea is to put this bishop on e4 try to take on d3 and take on b3 there's a lot of ideas that i could employ here to win the game because i'm low on time i'm well i'm going to play a little bit quickly here but there's one more thing that i want to do because it's an end game what is the sort of textbook piece of advice that is often shared in the end game what is the textbook piece of advice that's often shared in the end game what do you kind of always have to bring your king up so i'm going to do that i'm going to play lip service tonight even though in a real game i wouldn't have gone king g7 i'm gonna show you guys that i care uh about endgame principles and i'm gonna get my king maybe to f6 maybe it's just a g7 so it you know so it just stays ready for future action uh now let's get this rook up to a nice little square on e4 uh potentially i'm eyeing the maneuver rook at four rook f2 but why did i play rook c8 i have 38 seconds one more move i want people to find okay so rooksy one was a blunder but can somebody answer me that question why did i play rook c what was i preparing to do yes i was preparing to break with c4 and i'm actually still going to have a chance to do that why am i breaking with c4 well because my pieces are more active than his according to our principle that we've formulated many times when your pieces are this much more active than your opponent's pieces at some point you're gonna have to open the position up and the more you open it up strategically the more the domination of your pieces can be displayed okay so everything i did hopefully makes sense here i didn't do a single move that was mysterious everything was just simple improving my pieces or making my opponent's pieces worse either both of these are the two sides of the same coin and that's how you play on games light all right so we're just going to take this guy and we're going to try to trade the rooks and promote the spawn force and to give up this knight boom now there's many ways of winning this position uh but in the spirit of uh preventing our opponent from doing any shenanigans what would we do we want to prevent every single shenanigan here and he's got only one source of shenanigans that's the b-pawn what would we have done rook b1 is correct right now i know that my style is crazy and i like sacrifices but it's important to know how to play like this too right in order to develop a sacrificial style you also have to practice essentially identifying and preventing your opponent's ideas the boa constrictor style that petrossian the karpov is is snowfall okay one moment please well unholy soda hopefully that answers the question a little bit let us continue with another game and you guys can see that our opponents are are better now right they're not they're not folding over and dying easily but that doesn't mean you know that we have to despair we just have to apply our principles to a greater extent once again some of the guy plays h6 i don't get this move at all so we're gonna repeat what we did in the previous game and uh already at this point uh i you know i i said before that that we have to accumulate our advantage slowly but the moon bishop g4 specifically is a mistake and the reason it is a mistake is as we have discussed many times it leaves these two pawns both undefended and that can be exploited with one very typical move yep jason i remember your request and so i'm not gonna say i deliberately did that but i had that in mind maybe three is correct and uh he is in huge trouble right out of the opening and and this is why i recommend people to study the opening because i didn't do anything crazy here but at my opponent's level he should know he should know the stuff i mean he shouldn't get into this kind of trouble in seven moves in one of the most conventional openings not not to like give him crap or anything but if you want to learn from his mistakes then um you know this can be very easily avoided if you just learn the basic theory of openings now my opponent is actually playing this quite well right he takes on f3 and he takes on d4 thank you nichola for the thousand bits but i saw this right he is winning the pawn back if i take on d4 then he will take with the knight and uh his knight will be very active so what should we do in order to limit the activity of his knight how do we use our pieces in order to limit the the mobility and the activity was that bishop d5 is the right idea but not the best execution there is a very similar way of doing that right bishop b5 to pin his knight uh and essentially immobilize and rook b6 here would be a very strong move let's see if he finds it and then we will drop our queen to a4 in order to reinforce our pressure on the diagonal no these guys are good i mean uh again i don't mean to suggest that these players aren't good they are i'm actually very impressed with the level displayed by some of these uh some of these players and now we're just going to take on d4 we are up upon we are in great shape and his position is essentially in ruins uh so let's see what he ends up doing here black has ways that he can try to fight and he does find one of them he plays d5 well he he sort of he he he tries to open the position up and and this speaks to something that i shared earlier which is that in such situations the best way to react is sometimes to do nothing but to sort of passively develop right and and i know that you guys and i see that you guys want to play knight c3 which i love right you just develop it's okay the blind knife thank you for the tier one and in a situation like this we just continue developing how do we continue developing with an eye toward supporting the pawn on t4 i don't want this pawn uh to get to get weak let's go bishop e3 bingo okay let's castle along in order to tuck our king and he's probably going to castle short and now well we have a situation of opposite side castling what does that mean that means we need to start attacking and we're going to do that with the very typical move h4 i am playing with fire here i'm just not expecting him to well first of all i think that we're playing well um this is not necessarily my repeat i'm not playing exactly how i would actually play in a real game against the gm because i'm also trying to emphasize certain important themes and the application of certain principles i'm not trying to dumb it down for anyone right that's not what i'm doing but what i am doing is i'm trying to steer the game in certain directions that may be more conducive to people's learning uh than if i were to strictly play in the way that i would play against the ngo okay now the time has come for us to uh take care of a couple of things right well actually no the time hasn't come for that yet let's continue attacking what do we do how do we continue attacking he hasn't pinned himself by playing queen e6 we should keep that in mind he's unpinned his knight but i don't really see where that knight is going to go so let's go h5 now e5 is the move that most people are suggesting and i was going to propose that move initially but when you push a pawn in the center you always have to ask yourself what the drawbacks of that move are and had we played e5 notice that we would have weakened that f5 square and his knight could have occupied that square and exerted pressure on both the bishop and the d4 he's gotten rook to a8 that is a very slow move it allows us to open up the h-file clearly he wants to prepare a6 but what he's not sensing is the time right he's not sensing the fact that we are so close to just checkmating and thank you big sweaty father uh for the sub to uh ice cream overlord he sets a vicious trap if we take on h6 we actually lose a rook does anybody see how if bishop takes h6 he takes we take on h6 loose pieces drop off when you castle long you have to pay special attention to that position of the king on c1 he has queen f4 so let's first play e5 in order to force this queen onto a compromise square and only then are we going to take on h6 that was a pretty vicious trap i don't know if he said it consciously or not but in any case that was pretty impressive uh but that's why we have to doubt everything right we always have to double check we have to make sure that we're not stopping the calculation pretty much early and that we're actually checking at every juncture for our opponent's ideas right and so that just has to be sort of an automatic process okay now a crucial question to ask yourself in this position is he actually threatening to capture on b5 is that a threat is that a threat that is actually not a threat because 88 is gonna be hanging but uh and and follow me carefully here even though it's not a threat uh we have to be aware that he might move his rook away and uh after he moves his work away not only is ab going to become a threat but in addition to that if our bishop moves away he's going to take on b2 so what i propose folks is that we take care of this bishop immediately so that we can untie our hands we can wipe our hands clean of this and what does that allow us to do that allows us then to repurpose our queen from a defensive piece in a piece that is mired in in just crap on the queen side to a piece that actually helps in the attack now when i say helps in the attack what do i mean where does the queen be long if you could point to any square on the board here where does the queen be long how do we get it there it definitely belongs well ultimately where does it belong everybody's saying the correct move but what i'm asking people exactly so h6 or h7 one of those squares on the h file is where the queen belongs he's probably going to go rook b this guy is playing probably like a 16 1700 and we are going to play one move b3 here to take care of the b file pressure then we are going to probably continue our plan with queen d2 clean h6 the other idea here the other way of executing this very same plan of putting something on the h file can somebody tell me what i'm talking about here let's say that we did not want to move our queen we wanted to keep our queen on c2 in order to protect uh some of these pairs what else could we have done we can exactly we can double up the rooks now before we even double up the rocks i'm looking at this knight on c3 and i'm saying there is a very very very juicy outpost for this knight this outpost will guarantee that he doesn't have any shenanigans down that c file uh could we get that knight over to that outpost exactly we get that knight over the outpost c5 how did i find this move well i asked myself what does he want and i recognize that he probably wants to play c6 and i don't like pins like this right i don't like my queen and my king both to be penned by like a measly rook so by improving the position of the knight i'm able now to resort to revert back to my original plan and i'm actually just gonna keep my queen on c2 so it just guards and supervises that knight on c5 lends some extra protection to it and i'm gonna i'm gonna delegate the task of checkmating him to my rooks at least initially he goes a5 so he's he's trying to execute an attack of his own but as you guys can see my attack is both faster and stronger uh and it's going to lead to checkmate a lot faster again these games are are very competitive i mean these players are good uh but at the same time i'm not doing anything crazy i'm just sort of playing typical attacking moves i'm improving my pieces and i'm winning the game okay so let's see what he does i'm going to catch my breath well that's the point of the speedrun though i'm not trying to suggest that it's easy uh but what i am trying to suggest is that most moves most people can make these types of moves on a regular basis and while chess mastery is a very difficult process uh this this this tendency to by by some people to claim that it's some sort of magic uh in the direct sense of the word is wrong uh there is logic that goes behind every one of these moves and i'm trying to at least partially uh you know expose that logic and and show what it looks like if only to you know inspire some of you to to pursue this kind of master okay so he resigns uh yeah uh so in polar bear bc five gifts it keeps me going and that's what keeps me going i appreciated polar bear uh thank you for the gift it's up to doe gator to shigeru to jusco and craig and knighting samurai cocaine um all right um so let me see we have over 2 000 subs which is awesome and the support has been unreal well thank you guys i appreciate it yeah this is definitely uh you know demanding of energy but uh it's the best kind of demanding and to have people who appreciate me is is honestly amazing so uh it let's get a first look at the first game here with the king's gambit now there's many ways to play against the kings yeah but and if you guys watch that old lesson i gave to tori there is even the move c6 here which i uh once showed to john davis uh it is a very interesting and very rare move it actually prepares d5 it's kind of like a karo khan within a king's gamut right you guys have seen the karo khan so this is kind of like the karo khan in the king's gamut uh you prepare the pawn break d5 so it's a very interesting one but in this game i decided to play very simply right i open up the center i get the knight over to to t5 and i earlier mentioned uh well i would recommend 100 end games you must know that is one good book on grand master on on theoretical endings now this is the moment that i wanted to focus focus on because a lot of people would look at this and say daniel aren't you giving up your pawn you had an extra pawn you're giving it up why are you doing that and this again allows me to reinforce the concept of transforming your advantage it is true that our opponent sacrificed upon a move too but that creates for us a bargaining trip we can use this pawn and we can give it away strategically in return for other advantages such as the fact that he no longer has an attack against our king we have the two bishops which is a tangible advantage and we well it's not even compensation it implies that you're down material we're not down material material is equal so here we can go c6 just defending that pawn and staking a claim in the center we've got the two bishops we have a very comfortable position i wouldn't say that black is better necessarily but black is certainly very very comfortable here because of the two bishops solid position and good development okay so that is another thing you have to make sure you understand about gambits you can take that pawn with the intention of ultimately giving it away in return for other advantages all right so in the game he ended up not accepting that pawn for a very long period of time and when he finally did take it he allowed me to take on d4 with my queen and essentially force the trait of queens now somebody asked i think abdulrahman asked why did he have to take the queen why can't he just slide his king over and basically force me to retain my crappy pawn structure well can somebody answer that question for me what exactly is the reason behind yes queen takes p2 i mean simply you take the pawn and you're up another pawn now black doesn't win a rook but this is a very problematic i can even return to d4 so this is all very straightforward stuff ctxd4 rook b8 and at this point i just started that end game campaign i get my bishop to the best where i can go to now this boa constrictor style asking myself what my opponent wants and preventing an f6 g6 literally just stopping this knight from getting to any of these active squares it drives my opponent crazy right a5 stopping him from expanding and eventually right look i'm just sending every single piece away rookie 8 against top 95 and now c5 to cement the pawn on d4 and finally i'm preparing the decisive pawn break c4 that's some people ask like how do i actually how do i actually you know win the game when i do this well you have to start looking for bond breaks or you have to start looking for ways to actually start attacking your opponent's king uh but here i decided that a pawn break would be most fitting because of how stretched out his resources are but he made the task quite easy for me by just giving up a rook or rather an exchange and now the pawn break was even more effective because i have two rooks to one i trade rooks and he resigned so that's you know that's how that game went and again here he he essentially killed his chances for the whole game by playing h6 i mean i just don't understand that move at all because it doesn't even really prevent anything uh so it allows me to occupy the center now the book queen b3 and he's already in trouble right he's already in big trouble uh because f7 is hanging and b7 and honestly uh in this position i i remember that i actually missed a much stronger move i can actually play a preliminary tactic and only then take on v7 can anybody actually spot this tactic i miss this in the game and this is actually theory i remember this now it's actually not d5 well d5 uh is a bit counterproductive because the knight moves away you plug the diagonal it's bishop takes f7 good job queen takes f7 and the idea is that the knight is now undefended white is simultaneously attacking two pieces and white is going to end up up two pawns at the very least so that would have been even stronger than what i did but what i did was good i mean i have huge pressure on his position i went upon and we get this opposite side castling situation which often means that you have to immediately start attacking your opponent's king because time is going to be very limited and that's exactly what we do we attack our opponent's king by opening up the a trial we avoid the move bishop takes h6 because that would have plundered the rook we first play e5 then we take the pawn we don't take the pawn to win a pawn we take the pawn to open up that h file we clear it clarify the tension get the knight an outpost double the rooks and deliver checkmate on h7 yeah i mean not blundering this kind of stuff takes practice right it takes that sort of metal detector if you will in your brain that that can only be built up through years of training in a blundering like this all right okay guys so that was i think enough speed running for this evening i'm feeling pretty drained uh because these games were actually pretty uh pretty rich you know they were full of life [Music]
