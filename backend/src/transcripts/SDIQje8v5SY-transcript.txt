okay so we're gonna play d4 and i'm gonna play a london system so i know that a lot of people oh i should get my notebook ready i know that a lot of people do play the london and uh i i'm sensitive to that so let's play a couple londons all right where's my charlotte chess center pen oh my god i didn't even come prepared this is ridiculous i can't i can't play without my pen okay it's fine i'll just play without my pen okay so [Music] we're going to go knight c3 here and transpose them to the jabal london um i've done that several times now you guys already know the drill uh this knight can potentially go to b5 but we don't want to go knight b5 here knight b5 here would be bad for what reason who wants to tell me why is knight b5 innocuous after bishop f5 that's why he played it correctly because of what specific move uh not queen a5 because of c3 but rook c8 and it's not actually the check that's a muppet that's the most popular wrong answer so now what we're going to basically say is we want control over this diagonal now what is blocking bishop b5 from being a check the knight on c6 how do we get rid of the knight on c6 we slam our knight into e5 that is one of the key ideas of the job london the move 95. now there are several ways to think about this this bishop on f5 is actually in more trouble than it may appear and what idea if you guys have been attentive to my actual games what idea does white have which exploits the hidden vulnerability of this bishop it's actually a henrik on the ball g4 and h4 and the thing is it's not that black loses the bishop but black may have to go h6 and if the bishop is on g6 and the knight is on e5 then knight takes g6 forces f takes g6 which is actually tremendously awkward okay so we're actually kind of spoiled for choice here let's actually see how this works g4 let's actually see how this works uh i had a really really cool game which happened which went exactly like this over the board game which where i beat a gm yufa daniel yuffa 2500 and this causes a lot of problems for black there's a lot going on here there's a lot to unpack but everybody should see that the bishop is being attacked right now okay now black has a complicating move here which may seem to offer a solution to black's problems what am i talking about here what move seems to offer black a solution to the problem of the bishop it's kind of an interest it can be thought of as an intermediate move the knight takes e5 right and the thing about knight takes c5 is that after knight takes c5 d takes e5 if you look very carefully both the knight and the bishop are hanging but black can play knight takes g4 but at the very end of that line don't forget about the main idea of the move 95 what move becomes possible one move becomes possible at the end of that line i'm asking you guys to do some visualization here not easy but what i'm asking you guys to visualize is knight takes d takes knight takes g4 bishop b5 check is devastating because there's nothing to block that diagonal the king has to move out to e7 which is actually quite devastating 250 thank you and uh that is just absolutely devastating when the king moves out to e7 in the opening that's generally not a good sign unless there's extenuating circumstances now of course we play the typical move f3 attacking the bishop forcing it back to g6 so i'll explain everything after the game i'll show everything on the board don't worry guys if you're having some trouble visualizing this is let me grab my pen in the meantime so bishop g6 h4 that is the bottom line and here we go h5 so now we play knight takes g6 now how do we how do we exploit the fact that the g6 spawn is weak how do we exploit this let me just write some stuff down yeah bishop d3 is correct thank you marco barr bishop d3 is correct bishop d3 attacking the pawn and of course knight takes d4 is not possible now knight takes d4 is actually not really a threat because bishop takes g6 check exposes the attack of the knight so the way that we need to think about this position okay how do we how do we arrange our pieces here what what needs to be done in such a position in order to increase the pressure and what we need to not lose sight of is the fact that we haven't completed our development and in order to complete our development and this is a concept that i'm going to flesh out after the game we're going to go g5 here which is not an intuitive move why am i closing down the position when it may appear white is the one attacking the reason i'm doing this is in order to give myself a little bit of time that i'm going to use to prepare castling long so here we're going to go queen to d2 remember that knight takes d4 is not worrisome i can actually just ignore that move entirely can i ignore this can i castle here is it possible to castle do or do we need to deal with this do we need to take the bishop yes or no yes says nanuka no no that's why we put the queen on d2 now we bring the rook into the game final piece comes into the game let's get rid of the knight and now a very typical winning move this move crushes when we have a pawn on g5 pawn on e6 is weak very thematic this kind of should be automatic to you guys in many of these positions boom goes the dynamite isolating the king is the second worst defender after the queen right the king is a very bad defender of anything because it can be easily attacked and a check needs to be dealt with by definition now if the king tries to cling to the pawn into one of these two moves what follows king f6 or king e7 meets with what response and that of course is you guys your tactical detector should all be on high alert in this position anyway and the fact that the king steps into the same diagonal as the queen should also be something you pay attention to yeah sexy car is in the is in fact in the chat and now we play rook takes c6 okay rook takes c6 now look at this uh scenario this is also something that should alert our metal detectors because uh what we should notice here is the fact that a mate on ea is actually very likely we already have some sort of distraction sacrifices which may help deal with that so what move helps um orchestrate helps in helps create the possibility let's say for the background maybe that is of course to double the rooks now um we don't need to overthink things all we need to do is simply collect the harvest as they say in russian let's take on d5 no need to do anything absolute no need to do anything outlandish in such a position we simply want to improve our pieces until an opportunity to win the game kind of naturally presents itself okay how do we go about winning this position who can propose a simple way to improve our position and what i propose is to play this gradually and slowly rather than do anything crazy or alternatively we can sort of try to understand okay let's think logically how do we get our rook to e8 let's create the item on our way we need an item on our wish list our number one item on the wish list is to get a rook to e8 and we know that we need to employ for this task the least valuable piece you guys are making the same mistake of employing the queen but we can actually employ the knight we can go knight c7 and the reason this is better than queen e3 is because we actually win black's queen that's the reason why involving the queen isn't such a good idea because ultimately we're going to capture with the queen and offer a queen trade we don't want that we want to win black squid not trade it i hope that makes sense uh this is a not an easy concept to fully explain but you guys can see it applied quite frequently here okay this no queen f5 does not work and i'll show that after the game it comes close to working but it doesn't it comes close to working but it doesn't no rookie immediately you are insane unfortunately you are insane 97 he would have just taken i wasn't sure that 97 is the fastest win 97 takes takes and why is 97 so good then he takes on g6 i'll show this after the game guys people are overestimating 97 check resigns okay okay so we get a jabba london right knight c3 bishop f5 first point why is knight b5 not dangerous here um i know that most people are attracted by this move but be careful about this move in general um queen a5 doesn't actually win the knight the knight is defended so when we move the knight out of c3 we can simply play the move c3 which by the way is a helpful move regardless the move c3 creates a pawn chain and protects the d4 bomb we don't want to help white play this move and the queen on a5 is kind of offsides think of a soccer player that's kind of offsides so the way to actually protect against knight c7 is to go rook c8 literally to defend the square and if you compare this to a scenario like this the main difference is that the move rook c8 is not possible that's why you need to get this bishop out of the way okay and black's next move is just going to be a6 kicking the knight away from b5 knight c7 check just to be very clear two pieces for a rook is not good for the side that gets the rook in just a regular middle game unless there's an extenuating circumstance okay so this doesn't actually work for white there's no way to enhance white's control of the square oh silo simon with a thousand bits thanks man and thank you for all of your support engagement valued member of the community silo uh thank you so much man i really appreciate you and uh thanks for the thousand bits always welcome enriching our discussions appreciate it merry christmas to you as well okay so um basically does that make sense that's why you want to be careful about the move queen a5 okay so knight f3 e6 and now knight e5 this is the key idea of the juba without this move this entire setup would be less than perfect and i actually think e6 is inaccurate i think knight f6 might be a little bit more accurate to leave open the possibility of moving back for the mission okay so just to reiterate just to reiterate 95 bishop e5 the whole point of the line is that bishop b5 check is a very big threat which drives the king out of e8 so if i were uh chess kid i would maybe do this okay just take and go e6 get the knight out of the center and go a6 i know this looks a little flimsy but you quickly develop your king's side i think black is fine here but after knight f6 g4 i basically am playing on both sides of the board now let's analyze the complications arising after knight takes e5 okay so d65 happens right now let's unpack the situation as i've advocated many times don't panic when you see a lot going on we can isolate the sort of separate elements of the position that'll help you understand what's happening no problem knight is hanging bishop is hanging two pieces are hanging at once okay now both pieces can be protected at once we can play bishop takes g4 and in the event of this move white has several ways to win the game could somebody propose one of them actually you want to be very careful you want to be accurate here well f3 is the obvious move but bishop b5 is the five head move check now you do have a way to block the check but whoa this leaves the bishop undefended and if king e7 not only is this bad at per se check and i win a second piece so bishop b5 is a very strong move knight takes g4 of course bishop b5 and in this position uh the simplest is i think to just kick the knight away and i know that a lot of people are like whoa whoa this is checkmate this is not checkmate remember there are three ways to deal with a check to move the king to take the checking piece and to block the check you need to check all three boxes before you assure yourself that it's made and here box number two is not checked you can go f6 and look at the bishop on f8 that bishop is actually very important defensive piece because after takes takes the bishop opens up its defense of the night you're not winning the piece so instead of doing something drastic the simplest as i've advocated for the whole speedrun is to go something like 2 and castle do not forget to complete your development when in doubt simply complete the development accumulate the pressure and actually the move queen d2 poses a hidden threat what is now being threatened let's say black plays something like rook c8 what move what can white now do and if you guys are very attentive to everything that this move accomplishes battery um battery equals another attacker bishop takes h6 wins a piece that is one of several things i can do i hope that makes sense yeah so i hope that makes sense so for that reason knight takes c5 doesn't work bishop e4 doesn't really help f3 bishop g6 h4 uh inducing f3 i think is neither good nor bad for black now black is forced to play this move h5 this allows me to ruin black's pawn structure uh around the king and now immediately go after black spawn with bishop d3 now if knight takes d4 then bishop g6 wins the knight okay so king f7 is basically forced now to move g5 i want to explain this move now there is a practical reason why i didn't just go queen d2 and this actually does give up a pawn now this is not the best pawn but i didn't want to allow this i i didn't want to allow this kind of avenue of play a lot of people were suggesting rook g1 and thinking ah let me x-ray the pun but now h takes g4 and don't forget the rook rook takes h4 my voice cracked again and black wins another pawn so the the reason i go g5 is because i'm temporarily closing up the king side in order to be able to complete my development without having to worry about stuff happening on the king's side so knight g82 now if knight takes d4 who can remind me of white's response in this position who can remind me of what to do and there's actually several things to do now bishop g6 is one move but what i would urge people to do especially at a higher rating if you're 2100 2200 you're listening to this but at all levels really do not rush to assume that you have to win the pawn back consider the move castles long the fact that black has taken the central pawn can actually benefit white because white's the one with two pieces on the d-file so these pawns on e6 and d5 they may look imposing but both of them are sitting ducks particularly the e pawn look at all of white's pieces clustered together in the center whereas black's pieces are barely developed so rook he one is going to come with devastating effect i would actually not force things with bishop takes g6 i think that we could get bit we could get better than that right so questioning your assumptions and not making these knee jerk response moves is actually a element of i think chess mastery at a higher level if that makes sense well knight takes f3 actually does our work for us now we open up the f-file the queen could come to f2 look at this look at this first of all the knight is trapped but even if it wasn't bishop c7 would expose the attack on the queen so i want you guys to understand that pawns in such positions when we're aiming for checkmate pawns can actually hurt us and sacrificing two three punts you need to be able to do that without a single second thought okay take that with a grain of salt that i'm not advocating for throwing pawns around and just giving them up willy-nilly but um in a situation like this black is so undeveloped that him taking another pawn is not going to make the difference okay i don't know if that if i'm explaining this in a clear way but my intuition here is just screaming that white is completely winning there's just no way black is going to defend this he's got not a single piece developed if you just compare the development of the pieces forget about everything else white's got all of his pieces developed black has literally just a knight on f3 that's it does that make sense so bishop d6 we castle here again we avoid the knee-jerk reaction we realize that the ah the queen defends the bishop we want him to take on f4 because then the queen enters the game dislodges the king from the pawn and then we play bishop takes g6 so knight g7 bring the last piece into the game knight f5 of course we take that knight and whichever way black takes he opens up a fatal avenue into his position if he takes f5 what is white's move we detect the change in the position and what do we do simple simple uh attentiveness to change oh yep pawn has lost its supporter knight takes d5 and if g takes f5 we we push through with g6 if king takes g6 this is a fork so the king has to go away rook takes c6 and now let's fast forward to this position now first of all queen takes f5 i understand what people are thinking which is that ah this is gonna be checkmate but remember there are three ways to block a check to defend against the check moving the king taking the checking piece and in any order or blocking the check so here categories two and three are both alive we can take the checking piece and now we can block the check so when you are about to do something like this my proposal my piece of advice is to actually go through those three check boxes and make sure that they are not checked make sure that you have accounted for them when you literally tell your brain check for ways no pun intended to block the check you're more likely to find queen fe than if you're sort of uh free rolling and trying to search around so queen c7 it's the same principle right a lot of people look at this and say well white is winning right because this is checkmate but hey is black forced to take on e8 black can just drop his rook back to c8 covering the eighth rank and at the end of the day we're gonna be down to rook very important not to assume that your opponent has to check take a piece now 97 check i really am not sure what attracted people to this move because of knight takes e7 and now you relinquish your control over the g pawn hey black is back in the game black is back in the game now knight e3 is good but a little bit too slow this is good if in the absence of other options but knight c7 wins the game on the spot literally because there's no defense to rookie none zero black can't interpose the file rook takes c7 doesn't help queen takes c7 followed by rookie eight the game is over how did i find this move i used the wishlist method i've advocated for the wishlist method uh a lot since i hit 2000. in such positions you create a wish list what is my number one ideal aspiration what do i want for birthday what do i want for christmas pretty fitting example i want a rook on e8 now am i crazy to think this is like what we ultimately want because the rook on ea would win his queen okay how do we get it there okay queen e3 comes to mind can we employ another piece other than the queen because we already know the principle if we can do something with a with a lesser value piece normally that's a better idea than doing it with a queen we leave the queen for the most important tasks and then we see knight c7 it takes a little creativity but knight c7 is not hard to see if we apply that particular logical chain okay so we've been experimenting with various openings holy smokes lion pride five tier one sums thank you let's go with another accelerated dragon let's go with another accelerated dragon and again he goes bishop b5 everybody seems to be doing this at this level now we keep the spirit of the accelerated by playing g6 this is called the rosso limo bishop g7 damn girl thanks eddie keeping that hype alive love it okay so now what move have i played in these positions i've played kind of the same way in these types of positions in order to institute a bind in the center this move seems counter-intuitive right because the bishop is good but we use the bishop as a cog in the machine and the machine is control of the center okay so now we get the knight to e7 we don't want to interfere with the bishop's control of the center 500 bits in crocodile style thank you so much man i really appreciate it that is a big time bomb now this is weird because this does give me a pawn now i know that pawn sacrifices of these n of this nature do exist but i'm not really convinced by this i'm gonna take twice okay i'm gonna take twice let's see what he has in store for us yeah let's take take twice okay so e5 now the reason that i'm skeptical about this way of playing is that the pawn on e5 is itself going to be weak and his entire his entire strategy hinges on him being able to sustain that pawn on e5 if the pawn is gone then his whole position comes unglued so knight takes d4 is is impossible really because of knight takes e5 now i know a lot of people probably want to go d6 at this point but that carries its own danger because d6 ed6 queen d6 opens up that e file so we might very well want to play d6 but we need to calculate we need to ensure that after d6 ed queen d6 and i'm actually very skeptical i'm not even going to engage in that i'm going to castle why why go for something like that when we have a perfectly good alternative in castling and i know a lot of people are like wait we can go queen b6 and attack the bishop but let's reserve that move in case he moves his bishop away from c1 which he does and he does that in order to overprotect the pawn now the other side of the board has gotten weaker so now we can go queen b6 and skewer the bishop to the pawn and now we can chase the bishop away okay so you can see the logic here in effect now he's actually playing this in a very interesting way bishop d3 would be the best move for white here and uh this pawn is very annoying uh it's not helping my bishop develop i think a6 was a little hasty so i wouldn't take the spawn the reason i would not take this one is after knight c4 i'll show this after the game i'll demonstrate this but that actually leads to some sketchy sketchy positional play so what should we do here now what i want to do i want to apply an idea that i've applied previously i do want to get b5 in i want to play b5 in order to liberate the bishop so what should i do how do we where should we move the queen so it's out of the way of the other pieces yeah so i've applied this idea in one of my early speedrun games i've even showed you and i'll show you guys again kind of the same idea applied in one of my games and this guy is actually playing legendary game right now this is going to get very messy now we're going to develop our bishop this guy is playing in legendary style right now we're gonna have to get his pieces off of their squares i've kind of underestimated some of this guy's play and he continues to play incredibly well so let's try to get this knight out of d6 how can we do that how can we get this knight out of dc well it doesn't work either no this is actually very bad for me so let's um let me think about this yeah let's go knight c8 let's let's try at least yeah all right this is not looking good guys um it seems it appears that i'm outmatched here but let's see well i i came close to losing a speedrun game yesterday but because these guys are now incredibly good guile pyle gilipili okay let's see what he does he did hold on to the pawn he won the battle but will he win the war will he win the war he has a very good move here i won't say the move in case you're watching stream which i don't think so but in case he has a really good move he doesn't play i thought knight e4 would have been super strong this i think gives me a chance um because what we have to do now is get our pieces out of their incredibly passive square so let's reactivate the knight we need to get that knight out of c8 it wasn't doing anything and then we need to get the rook to e8 really quickly we need to get those pieces pronto actually let's centralize our knight first let's send the queen back okay he has this move man this guy doesn't freaking quit um yeah this is very bad i actually missed this i'm losing my mind here i forgot about this move yeah this is probably just over let me think okay let's go f6 let's let's stop knight g5 at least no if he continues in this style it's over but we'll uh we'll at least test him a little bit okay so let's see what he does bishop e4 jesus okay so now knight takes e5 knight d4 okay i kind of have to do this i kind of have to do this and then knight d4 f5 i'm very close to losing that on the spot but somehow i'm holding on can i hold on here yeah the problem after knight d4 is that my knight is irrevocably caught in this pin it's irrevocably caught in this pin and there's just nothing i can do okay so he does whoa now that move is damn girl okay now wait let me think about this for a second that is an insane move um hmm yeah that's an incredibly good move he's not not paying attention to the the temptation okay let's try rook a8 actually let's get the rook involved let's get the rook involved let's continue testing him guys no accusations please we've been through this many times let's move the king out of the way otherwise he was threatening a discovery guys until we checked the game you must allow the possibility that i simply got outplayed which is which i've which i have gotten outplayed and these people are no longer you know this these games are all very competitive and i've been playing all day i'm a little bit tired so i'm for fully allowing the possibility that that i got outplayed he's spending a lot of time here and i think he's playing legit chess so this is this does not look like a oh my god but he's got this move holy smokes some of these ideas he's finding are just incredible okay let me think so let's go here actually let's go f5 i will check the game i check every game that i am on the cusp of losing i i uh advance i understand that it is unlikely that i get outplayed wholeheartedly by like a 2300 but unlikely does not mean we throw out accusations okay so we're losing a piece but actually i have two pawns for that piece so if he takes my rook um i'm going to try to flag him here although it's not going to be easy but i will try to flag him um let's see knight f3 that's another cold-blooded and incredibly strong move let's drop the queen back let's drop the queen back okay now he's he's very slow and what we're going to do here and by the way piece of advice if you're trying to flag someone the best way to do it is to do something like this right you go into this long end game and what you try to do you don't make any pre-moves you just you hope you try to stay alive as much as possible you you get a couple seconds here a couple seconds there and you want to confuse him so what i'm trying to do is confuse him make him calculate some moves okay make him calculate some moves make him calculate row k6 and okay he's spending like a couple seconds per move so i'm trying to slowly bleed out some of his clock okay now he has to look about rook h7 does he play it now we need next step is to get him below 20 seconds he's gonna check me okay no he's not now we need to run we run with the king because i know that that way i'm going to avoid checkmate for a long time although here i'm going to go king f6 verifying first okay now we bleed some more clock we bleed some more clock now we pin him you see bleeding more clock check bleeding more cluck and he did not get himself checkmated which was actually possible but he's not gonna make it because he's just spending i don't understand what he's doing but he literally is just going to sit this one out okay now i'm already in the game okay so that's how you flag these guys and let's i will check the accuracy obviously it'll be lowered by the low quality at the end of the game i mean this is what it is so we see 96.2 for us 91.7 very high quality game overall i mean very high quality game overall and um it see what this tells you is that this doesn't really address how the game usually goes like you can be losing and your accuracy per se can be higher than your opponent so let's actually look at the game i mean let's let's see so let me close it okay so why did i get in trouble now i won a very similar game to this myself that's kind of funny with white i think this is actually a mistake so what happens here this move d4 uh this is exactly how i sacrificed upon what this basically does uh and and in order to understand everything you need to understand uh that the battle revolves around the d6 square and you guys might be looking at this what are you talking dc what does this have to do with anything okay well what this has to do with everything is that you guys see this bishop right this bishop needs to get developed right if i don't develop this bishop my entire queen side is dead right dead and uh in order to develop the queen side effectively i have to be able to play d6 but if white gets a piece onto d6 then it's going to be an elephant sitting on me i won't be able to move my pieces around it's like the artery will be sliced between the queenside and kingside and that in effect is the idea of d4 what white is trying to do is carve out this maneuver that i have drawn on the board or this maneuver both of which result in a piece getting put on d6 or both okay now why can't black take this way and then this way this would be possible but in this position how can white prevent black from castling and by the way e5 would slice the bishop off of its base it's like a roomba that's gotten under the bed and uh it turns off right you can't get the bishop back to you i think this is even stronger than bishop h6 the computer indicates bishop h bishop h6 is the best move that would also be possible you can't get this bishop out of here look at this incredibly annoying bishop you can't castle white's gonna get a knight to d5 he's gonna start encircling you bishop takes b2 same principle that i just outlined i don't care about these pieces take all of them because look at black's position look at the development and now knight c4 knight d6 is basically just checkmate beautiful by the way look at this and i'll show you my game after this to give you some context into how this stuff happens so for that reason i played knight 64 and uh for that reason i played cd ed but now he goes e5 and the reason that d6 is not good is something like bishop g5 he just puts this guy on there and look at all of these pins crisscrossing the board now if d takes e5 what move does white play tactically speaking can white recapture the pawn on e5 and i want you guys to pay very careful attention to these two pins which means that both knights are immobilized which means immobilized means that this knight isn't actually defending that pawn knight e5 exposes both pins bishop takes c5 rook takes e5 and if black castles then bishop takes c6 picks off the knight does that make sense this would be an illustrative example of how d6 just doesn't work that's why i need to castle but guess what that comes at a price that price is that now d6 or d5 are impossible that just blunders upon so i decided to play on the other side of the board but what i didn't realize this move knight a3 is super good i missed this i missed this move it defends the bishop and simultaneously prepares what potential maneuver what potential maneuver is prepared by the move knight a3 aren't knights on the rim grim like why is he doing this who can tell me yeah knight c4 knight t6 right once this knight is slammed onto d6 it's actually incredibly similar guys insanely similar to a game that i had with the white pieces which i'm about to show you and by the way this is actually insane now um this is already like losing for black this is like literally losing i literally cannot move and what he now does is he just says i'm going to checkmate you now here i think he missed a winning move and i just checked the computer he had a winning move in this position this winning move is very hard to see in order to see it i need you guys to understand the concept of transforming the advantage right now there is this chest aphorism that good positions don't win the game good moves with the game we play to win the game so an outpost in and of itself and you guys are actually seeing the move you freaking beasts knight e4 the outpost has done its job now we need to get the knight to f6 and the bishop to h6 and literally just go for checkmate look at all of black species just visually clustered on the queen side so we immediately switch our efforts to the king side that's how i won my game and this is entirely unstoppable this is like plus five already this move wins on the spot so yeah so knight c8 he takes on b7 what he's trying to do is he tries to eliminate my strongest piece and then he's trying to go for checkmate so his idea also makes sense but it's not the best okay so i get my knight out of the doldrums but now i send this queen to h4 now he has this very grand prix attack style idea of piling up on the h7 pawn which is why i played f6 stopping knight g5 but now he goes bishop e4 skewering my knights i mean look how nasty this is 95 is forced and now rook 81 what he basically says this is the worst kind of pin the pin against the queen i cannot stop him from taking on d4 and literally just winning the night okay do you want me guys to show you an example of how 94 leads to checkmate i would literally now show you my game because i've made very much such a maneuver and it led to checkmate so let me show you my game which will help you then understand how these kinds of positions lead to checkmate let me demonstrate and i'm not trying to flex this is truly very pertinent you guys will see how similar the positions were they were almost identical now this game that i'm about to show you is from the tournament after i became a gm i was playing a very strong grand master from ukraine i was playing a very strong grandmaster from ukraine and i was able to win a really really nice game and uh i annotated it so you guys can see nerdy ski against andre waff 2581 so uh very competent very strong gm and i was 2503 feet at that point i had just because i just got my third norm uh in the tournament before and i was riding the i was riding a high i mean i was just really confident and i played another really good tournament so we can see same line and here i played c3 so slightly different mover he goes e5 guess what i do guys knight a3 knight c4 and d4 literally the same thing exact same pawn sacrifice and i get my knight to d6 so just uncannily similar and what i did i'm literally sitting on him rook a7 rookie c1 i played very patiently here and eventually what happened is this position okay this position happened and i have basically made all the necessary improvements in my position it is now time to transform the advantage and if i was able to do that and my opponent was able to do that 1984 there is an even better way of getting the knight into the attack and that is which move it's not knight e4 although that is fine which very pretty move gets the knight into the attack think g-file guys boom knight f5 if g takes f5 bishop h6 and because f6 is not possible checkmate is unstoppable so what i do here is i take the bishop and by taking the bishop i leave his king completely exposed and black tries knight takes e5 very interesting tactical idea queen e3 and i just drove his king out bishop takes f6 here bishop takes f6 by the way this move knight takes e5 that he made is really interesting if bishop takes c5 he goes queen takes e5 and because of the back rank this actually just liquidates in black's favor so instead i patiently move my queen away now bishop f6 queen takes c1 queen h6 tightening the noose around the king and now i drove his king out if king g7 then rookie 7 finishes the game so boom boom boom and he resigned here because it is checkmate in two moves check and queen g3 is checkmate so you guys can see along very similar lines i chose the right moment to exit the outpost right and this leads very quickly to the toppling of his the last remaining defensive piece and his king becomes essentially defenseless okay so transitioning back to the speeder and hopefully now you guys can better understand the sort of zen behind this move now knight f5 here doesn't actually work although it can be considered but knight e4 comes with a very similar idea you're trying to involve the knight in the attack and ultimately to trade this bishop so the way that he played was perfectly good as well and ultimately he ends up winning the piece so f4 is a really good move by him he attacks the knight if i move the knight he has bishop takes g6 with checkmate unstoppable because he's also attacking the rook and uh for that reason i had to give up the knight he's completely winning here we won't look at the rest of the game he correctly traded queens and basically he did everything well up until the very end um yeah if the queen was on g4 then knight f5 so literally you can see the similarity between these two games it's the timing i really struggle with one kind of good heuristic is have i made the necessary improvements right have i made the necessary improvements here look at how white has brought basically most of his pieces into the attack so most of his pieces are in the attack which means okay now we can switch to frontal attack 94 isn't such a big risk either it's not like you're sacrificing a rook or something you're just bringing another piece into the attack so you shouldn't think of this as such a committal decision or anything of that nature well my movie five was a mistake i think so somewhere here or maybe somewhere here i should have actually been bitten the bullet and got d5 i don't know probably i should have done this and after it takes takes uh if he goes bishop g5 here then i can castle maybe i can get away with this so i don't know these lines too well so this bishop b5 is super super dangerous for that exact reason that's another lesson to be very careful about playing these kinds of openings when you don't know exactly what you're doing my bad i i do try to answer every question but sometimes i miss them i bet so e takes f6 i don't know well i think knight takes f6 helps black because this brings my knight into the game and it defends h7 so it's actually a good thing this knight on d5 is like a sitting duck right white uses it as a tool to bring another piece into the game with tempo e-takes f6 would actually help this knight maneuver back into the defense straw man asks oh yeah queen takes b2 so why didn't i take on b2 back in this position and can i also show the idea of a6 queen a7 how did i know about this idea i'll show that as well so knight c4 comes with tempo and after queen before uh the sad reality ladies and gentlemen is that he can even go knight d6 again you guys might think oh he's coupon sound i don't give a knight is on d6 the fact that black has two on one here could not matter less if black is going to get checkmated so maybe i should have done this anyway and bitten the bullet but um it was very dejecting to just get the knight to d6
