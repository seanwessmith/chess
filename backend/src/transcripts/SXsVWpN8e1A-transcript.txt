[Music] ladies and gentlemen all right let's go we'll be getting some emotes any day now yes yes any day now guild wars okay let's go d4 this time let's go d4 let's play some main lines let's play uh names this is called the nimzo indian defense now i will explain this after the game properly but i'm going to play a move which i play as my main line that is the move f3 the idea behind this is very simple i want to play e4 eric thanks for the sub now we want to go a3 to chase the fish away worrying that i will explain all of the theory after the game basically you get this structure now what should you guys notice about the structure what does the battle revolve around the battle revolves around one very specific thing very specific thing it depends which way he takes knight takes okay is white going to make be able to play e4 is white going to be able to play for under the correct conditions i can't play e4 now even if i technically could i'm not developed so every action that i undertake from this point onwards is going to be directed at preparing e4 as fast as possible and developing this bishop is not essential to preparing e4 i need to develop the king side so that i can castle quickly so that i don't have to keep my king in the center when i do play four so let's let's see what i do e3 where am i going to put this bishop where am i going to put this bishop d3 then i'm going to put the knight on e2 i'm going to castle and i'm going to at some point be ready to play for this is the theoretical line black has several ways that he can go about trying to stop e4 uh but this is theory this line is not considered to be black's best but even magnus has played it before so it's it's very much legitimate and um 92 castles and i will explain afterward whether we will be ready to play e4 well if c4 then bishop b2 we don't have to worry about c4 c4 bishop c2 doesn't actually obstruct a rookie 80 stops it now where can this knight end up to prepare e4 where can this knight go with the express purpose of preparing e4 bingo g3 okay so it's not he does play c4 but here's the problem with the moves before he takes the pressure off of the pawn on d4 and can you guys see that now if i play e4 i also have to deal with this pawn becoming weaker once he plays c4 the pawn on d4 is better protected so i can direct all of my attention at preparing me for it would be possible to play before here but what do i need to do first as a good russian school boy that i am let's be patient and let's castle well space isn't important here space is a sort of okay transformational advantage space is like money i'll explain what i mean so finally we can consider playing e4 but let's be good russian skill voice and i guarantee you guys if we can prepare this well e4 is going to be a lot stronger so let's play knight g3 first why because ultimately the knight can go to f5 in some positions and there's nothing he can do to stop before once we play e4 we're going to just steamroll him on the king's side and i want you to watch very carefully how i go about doing that here we go yeah so time it goes okay so how do we do how do we do this there is a very typical idea here i will show you guys after this game a game in which i i applied this idea how do we make something of this pawn of these pawns can anybody tell me yeah we just pushed the pawns boom locking this in and then boom boom now we're not just doing this to win a piece although he can't avoid that even if this wasn't winning a piece this would just be crushing you guys should just kind of see that now bishop g5 is a good thought but he could play h6 and notice that the knight on g6 is covering the h4 square and the game is basically over so that's how effective this line can be if if black isn't very precise that's why i really play that's why i like playing and i've won a couple nice okay so five is a good move and here's the thing um what is the top item on our wish list the top item on our wish list is to eventually get our pawn to f5 and the move on poissant comes to mind but i actually am sound would be good but i'm going to play well actually yan poisson would be really good because the good thing about amphison is that if he recaptures then we have f5 winning a piece the problem without passant it is emotionally hard for me to part ways with my pawn sort of my pawn mass but uh you have to transform your advantage at some point and you you can't cling to something that's nice sometimes you have to kill your darlings as they say in literature yeah i'm writing down notes to explain after the game kill your kill your darlings is a phrase my english teacher used to describe you know something you have to do in writing where sometimes you get very clingy about a phrase that you think is good and that actually holds you up in terms of expressing your thoughts better so we're just gonna like autopilot this what do we do now just bash it in and this is the good thing right our pieces look at how well prepared they are to attack the king's side well queen g4 is tempting but actually queen g4 is a really good move yeah queen g4 is good but let's go f6 let's open up yeah this is very violent terminology i don't know where i i don't know why i'm all of a sudden said talking about the violently queen g4 would be good but um let's let's do let's do this let's open up the mission now let's figure out exactly what we want to do queen g4 here i know it's on a lot of people's minds but let's be methodical if we go queen g4 he can play bishop g6 and he can stop i will explain knight f6 we had bishop g5 so he can stop the bleeding on the g file so what we need to do is we need to find a way to bring another piece into the attack and we need to circumvent his attack on the g6 square his control of it there is a different square that this pawn now controls and that is the g7 square i know you guys are why the hell is he taking well by taking on f6 he's opening up the possibility of me pinning him remember how you decide whether a pin is dangerous is there a pawn protecting the pinned piece notice that alliteration in this case there is no pawn protecting the pin piece and so that pin is going to be absolutely deadly we're just going to pile up on this night and we're going to win the night and you're going to guys are going to see piling up all i'm doing is piling up in the night winning the night transforming our advantage up a piece in the end game the game is over that's it that's all i did let's bring the rook into the game and defend the rook okay now knight f5 here doesn't work because we lose control of our rook but we want to get the knights five so we need to move the rook first where should we move the rook we can also take on h7 that's a good move but let's go rook d6 that's the most active square for the rook because if his rook moves away from e7 we can go to d7 everything i'm doing should be making sense in terms of the attack okay so now that's a good move if we take it he takes back but we're going to do that anyway because now we can take d5 that was another reason i played rook d6 um well we keep getting sub bombs okay now let's just check again i want to emphasize that in the in this situation there are so many ways to win these positions sorry let me repeat though okay so i wanted to repeat moves i didn't want to lap to double get games guild and uh that was nice thank you and he also watches my stream so f3 the f3 is called the sameish variation and by the way yes it's it's the same issue in both the king's indian and in the nimzo indian friedrich samish had a thing for the move f3 and let me tell you he introduced some very serious lines into chess oh i am kyle iron man 500 bits f3 was first played in the year uh let's see when it was first played it was first played in the year 18 i'm sorry in 1930 by rottenstein but he didn't play it well boggle you off effin bubble you above max irva world champion played f3 samish actually i this is interesting so samish actually never played f3 but a3 is also the same as should often transposes why i can go a3 first and only play f3 later this is also the sameish and this samish actually did play so he sort of played this but i'm not sure why it's necessarily called the same okay now let's unpack what happened in the game i think that for black the move knight takes d5 is better because black immediately piles up on the base of the pawn chain this is a theoretical line i've also played games here i'm not going to delve into this but e takes d5 is the old-school main line now what should black do here black's main line is essentially to find a way to trade the bishop who can tell me how black can try to trade the bishop why do you trade the bishop to make it harder for white to prepare e4 because the bishop is the main supervisor of that all operation malcolm is on fire b6 and bishop a6 now you can say well no big deal i can step aside but now look at how good black's bishop is and in a situation like this it's harder to move the knight out because of the pin so it becomes quite a bit harder to prepare before so in this situation you actually don't do anything you just castle and that's that leads to some main light theory i'll show you guys the game in the slide so what are we so c4 is a mistake because it takes the gas pedal off of the d4 pawn at least keeping that tension would have made it harder for me to prepare for and once we play e4 it's almost winning for white because this is just completely unstoppable um i almost think this is losing i just don't know what black can do about this and let me show you guys a higher level game where i actually did something very very similar and beat a very strong player with this line now the game i'm about to show you it's a little bit more complicated so i want you guys to prepare for some more a little bit more messiness than in this game okay so basically this game i played f3 and i'll talk about space's money when we actually analyze well so you can you guys can see r dot cataloo 500 bits you guys can see um what he's doing here's knight g3 and now the move bishop b2 and i want people to help me explain this move why the hell are we putting the bishop on a square where it's literally blocked in buried alive by these two pawns exactly malcolm have tucker is on fire today i've noticed you're on a roll loving the engagement my friend so basically we support 600 bits from mine called iron man 400 500 600 here we go basically it it protects d4 so if we imagine when we do play e4 and i did uh you can see that in a situation like this the pawn on d4 is uh is b is being very well protected by the bishop and the bishop has a lot of what fill in the blank the bishop has a lot of blank link using terminology that we uh that we have formulated potential energy bingo potential energy all right bishop has a lot of potential energy it's bad right now but it's doing something really good rook c8 rook 81 rookie 2 so i didn't play e4 yet and the reason i didn't play e4 is because he takes and what super nasty move does black now have this is why patience is so important you have to always be attentive to why your opponent does what they do queen c2 so now laptop plays knight f8 e4 knight g6 threatening the fork so i step away with my queen if we go e5 here he counter forks my king and my queen and rock knight f4 we just go rookie f2 and now watch what happens watch what happens [Music] so basically this gets me these incredible pawns the game went on uh he didn't resign here but black is lost uh and it took me some finessing but eventually i played e6 his king was weak i got the bishop to a good square we went into an end game i got my pawn to e7 mozart of cheese thank you i won the other pawn and he resigned here because i'm just winning f7 and the pawns won me the game that's pretty symbolic essentially this is exactly what happens here e takes f6 and f5 fg and now f6 why am i playing this move well the logical reason is to open up the bishop but if knight takes f6 we go bishop g5 and his knight is busted also like you guys should look at this position and it should be very clear to everybody that white is completely winning i mean look at just look at the amount of pieces that are in the attack you shouldn't have to always worry about exactly how you're going to make things happen um you should use your intuition here to determine that you're going to have something here i mean black's position is just on its last legs and we do the same thing we did in the game why is space like money so money is something that society assigns value to money has no inherent value i can get out a one dollar bill or a 20 bill and somebody from a completely different culture would not necessarily understand its value it's a piece of paper and it we agree that it is value so you can use it to buy stuff and that stuff potentially has inherent value um something that we can all agree is valuable like a computer most people nowadays can agree it's valuable uh and don't nitpick you understand what i'm saying space and time in chess tempi time and space is the same concept space has no inherent value unless you make something of it so just grabbing space to graph space is sometimes good but it's only good in so far as you can transform it into some other advantage and uh some people i think have a hard time with this because uh space advantage is actually one of the most innocuous types of advantages you can use it very well i'm never particularly good with a big space advantage but you can also play when you're cramped to the last two rows that's not necessarily a deal breaker to some positions okay so just wanted to make that clear um i would say when you get to extra material that is closer to an inherent value kind of thing it's normally in any position an extra piece has immediate value toward winning the game space needs to be transformed into something before it literally wins you the game okay uh anyway so the rest of the game was very simple we um we win the piece here and that's it we're up a piece and the game is over so i really like the same variation of the nimso and uh it's black has other ways that he can play against the c5 as possible here that's probably black's most popular line in the modern day also he can drop his bishop back you can that's the hyper modern approach you could let white have a huge center and then chip away at it with a move like e5 that's another good line so i don't want to bog ourselves down with the theory but that was your introduction to the samish if you're a d4 player i would highly consider taking this on let's see how magnus went about preventing this stuff oh 300 bits thank you so much and it never stops thank you and c4 so here's how anand prepares it he goes g4 he gets the pawn out there first to fianchetto the bishop because this bishop will otherwise have a hard time developing carlson goes for the queen side pressure and you can see that anand does manage to organize e4 that's how he does it he puts the bishop on g2 instead of d3 anand was better in this game carlson won in the end it was a complicated game we're not going to go into it right now but um but but a non digi 4 in the end so you can see you found an alternate method of doing it let's get one last game in one last speeder in game and let's go back to playing e5 so knight f3 knight c6 and we have a four knights defense so there's many ways of playing against the four knights now one very topical line is to go knight to d4 here i'll explain this after the game okay so white goes for the drawing line yeah i was going to say the drawback of this is that white has this line which ends in mass liquidation so we have to take his knight he takes mine if i take on p2 he takes the bishop and he develops a lot of his pieces so we've got to take on f6 and um we get this very symmetrical position two bishops each it's not a draw but it's equal so we gotta develop our bishop he's gonna castle now can we castle or does this blunder upon on d7 can we castle or does this blunder upon these we're getting a raid oh my god don't tell me we're getting another raid by who we can why can we castle why is bishop d7 on a move because of rook d8 exactly guys very nice we pin him so we got to notice these things bishop d3 look at this bishop on c5 very carefully it's undefended which means he's threatening queen h5 do we need to stop queen h5 or could we defend the bishop and if so how what can we do zion pure and hard thank you for the raid sorry i might have a story d6 is exactly right good job guys d6 defense the bishop g6 defends against me this is probably still theory and now let's deploy the bishop now we got to be careful about where we develop it because actually let's not develop let's let's get the rook to an open file first let's be a little bit more flexible now we have to trade queens that oh okay queen h or wow this is still probably theory and i think i got myself in some trouble here i forgot about that move um [Music] do you guys see why i'm in trouble because bishop f6 is a big problem so here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna make a little envelope for the queen i'm gonna go h5 and the idea of this move is to get the queen to h6 uh at least my queen is in the game i am weakening my king side that is true but at least the queen is in the game um i haven't lost to anybody who wasn't using an engine yet but i will ultimately and uh you guys might be like well how do you know that it's worth making the week now a4 what is the threat what should we do yeah so this threatens b4 and a5 we need to create a hole for our bishop let's do that with the move a6 yeah it's making the best of an unfortunate situation you got to learn how to do that if you want to be good because a lot of people they blunder and they get so dejected immediately they don't realize that the situation isn't as bad as they're making it out to be so a5 would have weakened the b5 square which is a very minor point but just so you guys know the move a5 what we can be found out why am i not afraid of b4 i actually want him to go before because that would weaken the c3 plot i'm trying to lure him into creating weaknesses so that i can somehow counterbalance the fact that he has pressure on the king's side if that makes sense okay so rookie one let's get the bishop out um this should be six preserving the rooks on the board that gives the game a little bit more flavor we could have also gone bishop d7 that might have even been better uh supporting the rockanita kind of missed that move to be honest but this is fine um so let's see what he what he ends up doing still a pretty dry position not much going on um we have a nice bishop bishop f6 queen h6 is fine for us and um of course we want to play for a win here that's just what i want to do so let's see what he does maybe he over presses and um this is annoying no this line is very annoying i forgot about it to be honest okay so what should we do he wants to trade bishops we need to decide whether we trade and if we are going to trade we need to decide on what terms we want to trade so actually we are going to trade and the basic reason is i get his queen out of h4 where it was annoying me by preparing bishop essex now we have an opportunity we need to use this opportunity to try to seize control of the e-file the e-file is the main artery to his position how do we do that right because one rook defends the other but we have the move rookie five the rook gets onto a defended square it's like a checkpoint and our idea is to double hooks now you guys might look at this and say well wait a second he can go bishop f4 i know people are thinking this but if he goes bishop f4 then the rook can reposition to f5 that does give up the e file that is true but it puts a lot of pressure on his bishop and by extension on his pawn on f2 what i'm trying to do here is unbalance the position trying to get some intrigue going some tactics so that he has to calculate now he has a decision to make which is a good thing in blitz he's going to burn some clock decides to take of course we take with the queen now this is on our is under under our control talking too fast what should we do now where should we put our queen we have several good options several good options let's complete that five thousand same idea as workout five pressuring f2 now look at this bishop what can you guys tell me about it it's a what what what it's a type what what and what should we do here so we can just drop our bishop back right he can't take on c7 because it's a type type two undefended piece which means we need to notice that bishop and start calculating tactics in relation to it uh that also means the queen is tied down and if we attack the queen it's going to have a very very hard time keeping the bishop protected which is why he drops it back now we need to start playing aggressively here which often means sacrificing something so i have a very interesting idea in mind what yeah rookie 8 now we're sacrificing a pawn in order to grab control of e file but i have made a judgment call the judgment call is that seizing control of the file is so important that it is actually worth giving up the c7 over and potentially even more pawns i also have a tactical idea after queen takes c7 he's deciding whether to capture i can see the wheels turning in his head okay now let me explain this idea what is our top wish list item what would be like the ideal scenario here wait not rookie 2 because of rook f1 let me let me kind of justify it so the wishlist scenario is checkmate on e1 we want to get the queen to e1 if we go queen e4 we telegraph the pass right he can go h3 so can we set up a situation where we can simultaneously threaten checkmate in something else the move is h4 now he has to take i think otherwise he loses f2 with main we get the bishop on a type one on defended square and then we fork it by playing queen e4 there's complications there he can try to defend the bishop and made against at the same time but that creates other weaknesses then we threaten the bishop that's it that's the whole logic this is not that complicated i think h4 is a really really strong move that's what i saw when i sacked the pawn i'm sure there were other ideas here and i think he probably has some sort of a defensive resource but we'll see if he finds something right so bishop takes d6 don't forget why we played queen f5 in the first place don't forget that we're x-raying that pawn and he's paying the price for that now that pawn is gonna be unattended and if we take it we can then get a rook or a queen to e1 that's a sexy move yeah i think he's okay so i saw this too and this is a very strong defensive idea he wants to play hg queen takes a7 that queen is guarding f2 so how do we need to think about the situation well we need to first of all we still have the idea of bringing the queen t1 we cannot go queen e4 because he trades queens but um we can uh what can we do here what what are our options well we can play queen take c2 but then he takes a7 so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go queen e6 i'm gonna go queen e6 i'll explain type 1 and type 2 guys but you have to let me you have to understand that there are people joining the stream or new oh my god he defended he found a way to defend amazing because rookie 70s got a check all right i'm gonna have to take okay this is bad but there's the good news the good news is his king is still very weak uh which gives us hope but in general uh we're fighting for a draw now we're gonna snag off one of his pawns he actually found a brilliant offensive idea here we'll talk about it after the game for now we have to defend we're going to be down upon at the end of the day which is fine because his king is still quite weak our pieces are very active and we're only down upon and he's got a weak pawn in a4 but i don't want to trade queens if we want to keep winning chances alive we need to activate our pieces asap how do we do that how do we activate our work where do we put it what is so brilliant about rook well nuke i think it's a nice move i'm sorry if it was very obvious so first of all let's yeah rookie five is correct okay now we're gonna lift the rook up we're gonna lift the rook up thread checkmate okay we're going to thread and check and now what what do we do now he's weak in the diagonal how do we exploit it quickly help me out heroes how do we exploit it boom and he has to go f3 but now let's snag the pawn intermediate move snagging the pawn making sure the material is equal now let's go in for the let's go in for the kill queenie two threats checkmate it threatens a lot of checks we're gonna take here we're threatening checkmate again king h7 i don't see a defense and he's lost he has to give the queen up boom goes the dynamite thank you brett toad for the prime so we won in the end but that was a very back and forth game but it was a really interesting game so in the four nights defense knight e4 so type 1 and type 2 undefended pieces guys type 1 undefended by anything type 2 defended only by exactly one piece so he plays this line with e5 one of the main lines here is bishop back to c4 you don't really want to give that bishop up but he goes for this very drawish line where there's a lot of trades we develop our bishop castle castle bishop d3 and somewhere here i made a mistake i'm not sure exactly what the theory is here but um i think it's somewhere here ah so i think here i shouldn't have played queen uh actually this is fine but hero g6 was a mistake g6 was a mistake what should i have done instead h6 is correct and um we stop bishop g5 and we defend against mate i just didn't realize that the holes i'm making on the king's side are significant i forgot about this move and actually this move happens whatever we do i can't defend against bishop g5 which brings us into a very nasty situation now if we just pretend that nothing's happening he gets the bishop here and he clamps down and look how passive this is he can bring the rook to e1 he's got lobster pincer ideas i didn't want to allow this to happen now one second okay so basically if we go rookie six to try to defend against the f6 square then bishop c4 okay and uh we have to bring our rook back so we have to allow it but i did that by setting up the h6 square for our queen so we at least keep some pieces active a4 a6 again a5 would have weakened the square and also i wanted to lure him into going b4 so that he weakens these squares right so bishop b6 takes and rookie five now the battle revolves around the e file battle starts revolving around the evo who can get control of the e file if he goes bishop f4 i can reposition to the file you have to be flexible he takes and in this position i have a choice i can maintain my control over the e-file how can i do that if i wanted to maintain control over the e-fund where should i put my queen yeah i should have put it not only to have learners to queen not queen e6 guys because then he takes and he gets control of the but on e7 you shouldn't be afraid to make retreating moves at various wins then i can go but i wanted to play more adventurously so we got queen f5 uh trying to exploit the weakness that i have to also i'm attacking c2 okay so this is where i made the judgment call to sacrifice on c7 and in retrospect that might have been wrong so i could have gone c6 here and defended it he cannot take on d6 because f2 drops perhaps i could have done that um and instead i decided to stack the pawn so here let me unpack for a second the idea of h4 so h4 basically tries to lure his bishop onto an undefended square if we go queen e4 immediately sorry that is what i compare this to is telegraphing the pass in basketball that's like holding the basketball over your head and looking at your the person you're going to pass the ball to well the opposing team is going to see in football that's the thing is going to see who you want to pass it to and he can prevent the man with h4 so instead we lure the bishop onto h4 and then we're going to go with 84 and this creates a fork against these two pieces if he goes g3 he weakens his control over f2 we can slide our queen into f3 okay um and i think this creates very very big threat i'm not sure this is winning it creates big threats against skin black has a pretty strong attack uh donations we got a donation i'm sorry i i might have missed it oh one dollar from bracket boy thank you so much sorry i missed that donut one dollar from bracket boy um but yeah i try to read donations when possible because i have the alerts on okay so queen f3 would have been very strong but instead what did i blunder queen takes b7 is super strong fable thank you for the spawn if hg he goes queen takes a7 and simultaneously defends f2 this is what i missed so i decided to go queen e6 sticking to my old idea but now rook f1 is super strong he gets the rook onto f1 so that this move is no longer check and he doesn't have to take my queen he can just take the bishop for example okay and what i decided to do and at the end of the day uh i'm in trouble at the end of the damn troll because if i now move my bishop back maybe this was correct actually but then he plays bishop takes h4 and i can no longer get the queen onto e4 the great thing about this move isn't that it only takes the pawn it also brings the e4 square under control so look for these kinds of intermediate moves okay so rock f1 i acquiesced to a bad position but at least black has peace activity and return for the plot i think winning this would be really hard i actually think black's drawing chances outweigh white's winning chances activating the rook and here he made a very big mistake how should he have defended the pawn on g2 without weakening his king side not a not a pretty move but i think that g3 set him up for trouble so there's two possibilities here that would have both been better than g3 the first is f3 which at least is not as bad but i think windage would be the most circumspect it is true i can take his pawns now but it's a draw g3 set him up for trouble because now he has all of these weaknesses and this is so hard to defend in a blitz game i'm pretty sure you can still make a draw but in a blitz game these kinds of positions are super hard to defend because it's a it's a king weakness okay um so that basically won the game very back and forth very well played by my opponent which is awesome my opponents are putting up a great fight and we're almost at 2200 so we're 300 points away from the conclusion of the speed run it's been an amazing ride so far but i think i'm going to stop for today here i've got a lot of work to do guys unless there's serious objections um i think this might be a good good time to pause for the evening rent crow thank you for the prom skis thank you for the prime i see people trying to bribe me 245 from luki there's objections objection your honor yeah just give me a second let me let me sip some water yeah the thing is guys this does take a lot of energy you know i'm trying to really every move i'm trying to engage in the position and uh oh here come the brevis happy pineapple double oh seven five gifted fair enough okay we'll do an encore one more we'll do one more five three six one that's a great number we'll do one last one guys uh just give me a second to compose myself yeah you're very welcome thanks happy pineapple double007 gifted five appreciate it very much okay um oh my god here we go to seeb's matching it five gifted as well this man is on a tear today tess seems thank you for the five gifted um no i'm not trying to elicit people's like sympathy i i really enjoy this this is a lot of fun but uh this is awesome okay um so let's go into the pool i think i'm good now have a little coffee compose myself get my wish back holy smokes that's awesome julian all right um let's play one last one guys hey guys this is john okay now everything is going to be up on youtube oh thank you uh mad knocks my man oh i might have missed it sorry madness i'm really sorry i'll look back at it okay so let's go back to the sit sil actually let's play malachi now so a lot of people wanted me to play a jeep ribbik another sub wanted me to play an alakan i will respond now this position we can take the knight the issue with taking the knight is that he can take with the d-pawn and he accelerates the pace of his development so what we're going to do is we're going to drop the knight back to b6 and we're going to come we're going to control the center ourselves either with d5 but the alakan is what kind of opening fill in the blank now we need to go 85 to stop it from doing that and who can summarize to me the sort of fundamental logic behind these types of openings it's called a hyper modern opening the hyper modern it's not about it's not about controlling the center with as many pawns as possible it's about making sure that you can attack your opponent's center of the species you want to provoke your opponent into controlling a lot of the center julian berman thank you so we can't go d6 that was the point of his move now what should we do unless he doesn't control the center then we can actually finally you know we can we can make a claim to the center but let's actually go so knight c6 he would have d4 and i want to keep the c file let's go let's actually go c6 let's get the bishop out and and let's go d5 so our opponent has decided not to control the center at all so we have nothing to attack so again flexibility flexibility flexibility uh in any opening you want to have the idea of changing your strategy if your opponent does something weird you can't put your head down and always do the same thing every time people get into trouble because of that how should we go about developing this bishop without obstructing this bishop if we play bishop g4 he can start chasing our bishop around yeah we fianchetto and we attack e5 good job bishop g4 he would play h3 that would be kind of an empty pen okay so he's gonna fianchetto his own bishop let's let's castle let's complete our development now let's take a look at this knight let's take a good hard look ooh h4 okay now action on the flanks as we know from a very important principle is oftentimes met with action in the center what does that mean how do we ensure active development of this knight bingo c5 knight c6 now why are we putting the knight on c6 it's more active if we go knight d7 we block our own bishop and we potentially can consider c4 pressuring his position that doesn't trap the bishop because he can play bc and get the bishop to e4 so we need to be careful about that one second okay so knight c6 attacking e5 knight c6 attacking e5 and then uh if knight f3 what now are we going to do thanks again guys for all of the support and the engagement most of everybody being engaged makes this better and uh yeah this is awesome okay so bishop g4 is correct now we pin him because the spin is a very specific purpose we are trying to win the e5 pawn now let's unpack the situation we have many good moves here there's many approaches to the position he cannot push the pawn because his bishop is type 1 how do we apply pressure on this pawn how do we apply pressure on the c5 and that would be the most consistent strategy we can also go night before we can consider c4 there's a lot of possible moves here but let's keep things consistent with our general approach which is to win that central pawn thank you dovah 7. and you know this is annoying because it's hard to defend against consistency appreciated nova 7 priming uh but we shouldn't necessarily play bishop f3 bishop e5 so we can win the pawn we can play bishop f3 and bishop e5 but there's a little bit of complication there so let's let's do it we also have to be careful our king's side okay which way should we take the pawn very very important which way should we take the pawn so not bishop takes because of knight takes d5 we should take it with a knight to attack his queen if we had taken with a bishop we would have allowed knight takes d5 now we attack a screen and believe it or not there's something i missed here and yes i do miss tactical details occasionally he actually can still play knight takes d5 because it attacks my queen uh and that leads to a very interesting and very complicated situation i think he's calculating this i i will still be better uh because we will be able to move our queen away and force him to take his night to take my night with his bishop weakening his own king i'll explain that situation if he takes on d5 that's not an easy thing to see because a lot of people would automatically bring their queen back or take on e5 which would be even worse because we could checkmate him but we will see if he finds it yeah so you just got to be attentive to this stuff and that's a mentality that's a mindset in my opinion that's a mindset of not taking things for granted and always questioning your opponent he doesn't now what's the issue the issue is twitch let's go thank you divina rating 51 appreciate it we're attacking we're doing the speedrun attacking the queen and attacking the knight does that make sense guys if he moves the queen we take his knight if he moves his knight we take the queen so he has to take on e5 now which way do we take i just gave it away doesn't queen take c5 blunder knight takes b6 same mentality we don't take things for granted we don't assume anything about what we have to do we consider all the options no because a checkmate he's got to drop his knight back amazingly he holds on now we have an opportunity we need to strike we need to strike while the iron is high what does it mean to strike in such a situation couple of things to notice number one knight is tied down if the knight moves he gets checkmated boom we need to open up files for our pieces and notice that i'm making this move without calculating i just want to open stuff off it's only sacrificing a pawn it's not a big deal and we're opening up the c file and if he takes of the pawn then we can actually play knight takes a4 oh that is a very bad one that is panic but let's be logical in our thinking the knight is hanging can we defend the knight with tempo and then win the bishop yeah simple move rook a b8 queen has to move and then cd so he might trade queens here but we're gonna be up a piece once again excuse me transforming our advantage yeah that was panic but he was already in big trouble okay so he's creative but uh but this is not good enough so actually here if we want to play for maximum what he's allowed us to do is an opportunity let's not rush with taking the queen i know a lot of people want to take and take but we can just move our queen to c5 because the situation remains his queen is attacked and now in addition to everything else our queen has access to the a3 square in fact i'm telling you guys we might not even need to take the bishop we might checkmate him even without that that was impulsive but it was also panicky and i understand why so well just in case i'm putting out one video today my editor is working very hard as you know i have a lot of things i'm up i'm up to so it takes time now actually who with a keen tactical eye can find the wind here forget the bishop we have a better move remember that you're that his knight is tied down well we are speedrunning the editing believe it or not it's harder than it seems bingo good job guys knight is tied down pawn is pinned queen be too threatened he's made it in one simple effective and strong and we didn't even need to take the bishop that is why you don't rush because you find things out about the position when you take your time when you look at the whole board all right good game we're gonna go over the game then we're gonna pause for today i know a lot of people people like to bribe me but i you know this is gonna be the last game i still appreciate the bribes so okay again make it look easy well i mean that's the point hey harry shadow gets the sale all right so 21.99 i know what people thinking the alakan now knight c3 is a move but here bishop b5 was weird i mean he starts to he starts to just move his pieces around he should have gone d4 and then we go d6 and this is sort of a main line of the allagan wolfie encounter the bishop we will attack e5 we're trying to get him to take on d6 to give us more freedom white is slightly better in these positions but it's interesting we've played this before so bishop d3 is a bad move for the very elementary reason that it obstructs the bun i think he already at this point had the idea of fianchettoing but it's just janky d5 he could have unpassanted us but then we would have taken and developed our bishop to e7 and then castle black is completely fine i think he should have done that though he goes 92 and now g6 fianchetto in the bishop there should be two castles h4 he starts attacking so the principle dictates that uh when our opponent is playing on the flank the g moses another thousand thank you appreciate it when our opponent plays on the flank he takes his attention off from the center so we should do something in the center um and i can show you guys a lot of instantiations of this principle in complicated positions this is something that applies at a grand master level um i have a couple favorite games that really illustrate this concept um and sometimes cole drobo think for the prime you know sometimes playing the center involves doing something a little crazy sometimes striking in the center involves sacrificing so let me show you guys very quickly this is complicated but i won't delve into any of the complications uh korchnoy against luke mcshane british player very strong and this position court schneider is h4 so luke mcshane takes on d5 and what seemingly crazy move do you think he plays by the way i want you guys to notice the x-ray that is going to be important boom e5 ripping open the position and the reason he does that is that white is not developed enough on the king side now the point is if f takes c5 and knight c6 is a beautiful move using the x-ray and if bishop takes b6 then black has a humongous attack in return for the peace and um this is just scratching and if bishop takes c5 then we have that e-file machine didn't end up playing rookie 8 but now we use the bishop to accelerate our development and black gets a big initiative mcshane won the game so there's there's there's many details there but i just wanted to show you guys this does actually is is applicable the grand master level very much so um so remember that so c5 now knight f4 i think is a very expensive waste of time you should have probably gone h5 but now he gets in big trouble because his e5 pawn is indefensible we pressure it now we play bishop takes f3 and bit knight takes e5 if bishop takes e5 he plays knight takes d5 some of you might think oh wait a minute we fork his king a knight but he can just drop the knight back it's very important for us to keep the bishop because this bishop is the main attacker as you guys saw in the game 965 good job by my opponent but it doesn't actually really help because of this and now c4 opening up the position if b takes c4 what would we have done well i understand his panic because he's on the cusp of getting checkmated yeah knight a4 is very simple so he plays bish queen b7 but if bishop takes c4 then we'd go knight c4 and we could go queen c5 where we go rook cnn there's a lot of moves here that end up with the same results and uh this is just pretty crushing so he goes queen takes b7 and after rook ab8 f4 queen c5 we don't even need to play rook takes b7 and cd so this is just winning queen a3 knight takes a4 and queen a1 is checkmate and um that's just a very simple attack we didn't even have to take the bishop so this is just winning yeah 1pm tomorrow bullet championship so that basically was again it was the speedrun we're almost at 2200.
