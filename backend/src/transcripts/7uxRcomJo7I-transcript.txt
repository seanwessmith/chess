we are playing menger mania 1962. now i'm going to play the opening that i have been playing against 1d4 which is the king's indian defense those of you just joining describe i will explain once again the main sort of ideas of this opening if you've never played the king's indian it can look terrible what am i doing i'm giving him full control of the center and that's the point of the king's indian what you do is you give your opponent control of the center with the ultimate aim of attacking that center with your pieces from a distance [Music] it's called a hyper modern opening so here's the thing i'm going to go e5 and here we have it right attacking his center with my pawns this is the main move it does not blunder upon uh and i'll explain everything after the game it's up string good to see you and we're gonna open up the center so that we can more easily attack the e4 pawn with our pieces how should i attack the e4 pawn did somebody tell me the simple way bingo rookie 8 he's got f3 what is this move done immediately remember what i told you last game whenever the f pawn is pushed you need to understand the drawbacks of every move that your opponent plays now this is just a general weakening move but look at this bishop on e3 this bishop is undefended what does that mean that means that if we can get this pawn out of e4 that's going to be something a sticky situation now we can't go d5 immediately right because he takes with this one but can we prepare the move d5 can we prepare the pawn break d5 hoping to exploit his this is theory by the way he's he hasn't done anything wrong this is the main line but if white doesn't know exactly how to play here he can get in very big trouble he plays it correctly with queen d2 we've got d5 anyway because even though the bishop is defended it's still very flimsy all right this goes back to the concept of okay so e5 just gives up a pawn that's definitely not the best way to play it and uh we've gotten everything we've opened up the e file which we wanted and we've won a pawn okay so now let's continue our development by playing knight to c6 if he takes my knight we take with the pawn and then we are able to support the pawn on d5 queen e8 was possible but then he could have just dropped his bishop back right we don't want to like put all of our aces on the table at once so okay what should we do who can this is an interesting situation there's many ways to play it but um i want you guys to sort of be be engaged here in the in the development now rook takes e3 is interesting but it doesn't work and i will i will show this after the game so in if we were to follow the rules by the book we would say okay the bishop is not developed we need to develop the bishop where should we develop it i don't like bishop f5 because it allows knight takes f5 so we're just going to go bishop d7 remember what i always say not every one of your pieces needs to be working on you know the coveted vaccine distribution you could have a piece that's just sort of chilling you know on a beach somewhere and that's the bishop okay the point of playing bishop d7 is to just develop it connect the rooks uh and and and you're fine okay so what should we do now well i'm looking at the knight and that's setting the metal detector off of my head whoa wait a second knight's defended by the queen but there's a bishop here i can take on d4 i can get his queen onto a very vulnerable square why is it vulnerable because it's x-rayed by the bishop this is called an x-ray and the x-ray is a precursor to a discovered attack or a discovered check where you move you basically you tear the cover off and then that bishop is going to attack the queen but we want to get the most bang for our buck and as you guys are indicating knight h5 is the way to do it making contact with the bishop and now comes the winning idea once he takes what should black now do look at the position carefully how has it transformed what can we do to win the game that's why i love the king's indian you know white white makes one move incorrectly and he loses the game we chop off the defender of the bishop on e2 type one and type two undefended pieces come into play i will recap that concept for you after the game and we are gonna be up a full piece okay so i'm just making some notes about what i want to talk about it's very hard for me to sort of set in an adequate manner introduce the king's indian because it's such a complex opening let's unpin ourselves but i'll do my best and i've already talked about it on some occasions okay so uh he wants to go h5 some shenanigans let's let's cut that let's snip that in the butt uh not necessary but still now he's created a weakness on h4 queen is tied down to the pawn okay let's not forget that he threatens uh rook takes d7 where should our bishop go what would be a nice active solid square for the bishop not bishop b5 because that would blunder it but bishop to c6 right why is this a good square because it's defended by a pawn that's the only way to make sure your piece is really safe is when it's defended by fun i will delve into that after the game and once again a huge shout out still we have six thousand viewers amazing stuff thank you guys so very much for all the support all the hype and and the engagement everybody's engaged and i love to see that so now we have this rook on a it feels sad sad it's left out um let's make sure it's not left out by by creating the alakine gun alakine's gun is essentially when you triple your pieces i think technically it means like queen behind the rooks but informally it refers to any kind of tripling along a file named after alexander alekhine early world champion um fourth fourth world champion from russia and now if we remember something about his move h4 right it created a weakness we always need to sort of like a librarian we need to catalog all of our opponent's weaknesses what should we do check now let me all right guys i'm gonna rub it in a little bit we can okay he resigned i was gonna rub it in we could have gone rookie one with the checkmate or queen f2 but we had a pretty checkmate by sacrificing the rook we could have stacked the rook to open his king up further and guess what rookie 2 is a simple mate but if we wanted to rub it in even further who can tell me a very pretty follow-up that we could uh put on the board here further ripping open his king position queen g4 is possible yeah but also bishop f3 sacrificing the bishop check rook cuts off the king has to go back and now the ladder mate rookie two queen g2 okay so there was an abundance of mates here and he graciously resigned all right so king's indian first played in the in the year 1850 did not become popular until the 1920s 1930s and still rarely played until the 60s and 70s why because if you think about chess history i've explained this before when chess was first starting to be a thing uh people followed the rules right people follow the rules and the rules said that you had to control the center and in the king's indian black most certainly does not control the center with his pawns he controls it with his pieces that's why the king's indian is called a hyper modern opening because in the 1920s there was a group of uh pretty interesting people they were from all parts of europe and they were called the hyper modernists hyper modernist says guys let's let's all chill out let's uh you know sip on some wine and the people from california said let's you know let's uh you know do something other than sipping on wine uh let's all chill out for a second let's understand something you don't always have to control the center with pawns in order for your development to be effective what they said is that let's let our opponents control the center with his pawns and then let's shoot these pawns down from a distance that's why they deploy the bishop here and and that's why black sort of holds back white center without actually immediately contesting it and only black puts pressure on that center when he is ready to do so that's sort of the philosophy of the king's indian and the movie five comes right immediately striking the pawn on d4 i've played the kings in my whole life um now why doesn't this blunder upon why can't white just take the pawn there's a small tactic here uh and without this tactic the king's indian would simply fail yeah and i take c4 exposing the attack on the knight equalizing the material and white's gonna have black's gonna have a massive bishop here on e5 all right now commonly in the king's indian white pushes d5 this creates a locked center and then white castle's king's side this is what makes the king's indian fascinating it's an attack on either side of the white attacks on the queen side black attacks on the king side black goes for checkmate so it's a very ambitious opening it's an opening for aggressive players it's a very hard opening to learn instead he decided to keep the center open i opened it up and uh queen d2 was played now using chess base which i've as i told you guys i have used it to show you these these these games i am going to check for a second to see whether this has ever actually happened in tournament play and one thing that you can check using chess space which has the largest uh database of official tournament games ever assembled millions and millions of them i can check this position to see who's played like this before so queen to d2 100 okay over over 500 games uh and gary kasparov had a game here with the black pieces d5 is the main move and c takes d5 is rare only 22 games and then the move e5 was only played once in 2004 rook takes e5 so this position only occurred once in recorded tournament play in 2004 uh and of course i'm just much better because i'm up i'm up a pawn and i develop my knight in that game black played rook takes c3 which i completely don't get i think it's premature to do this even though black actually won the game icelandic player bjornsson uh i think he went like this maybe trying to pin anyways development bishop to d7 um now type one and type two undefended pieces very quickly um there's three types pieces can be categorized broadly speaking into three departments number one undefended type one i i formulated this myself it's a little clunky but mark my words i think it's helpful type one undefended piece is a piece that is literally unprotected by any other pieces or pawns does either side have any type 1 undefended pieces and the king we exclude from this category and the queen is in a special category i'll explain that um in a moment no he does not right then type 2 undefended piece and a type 2 undefended piece is a piece that is only defended by one other piece not a pawn not a game not a game practice one other piece which type 2 undefended piece jumps to mind using that definition who can tell me the key of course the bishop now the third category is a defended piece and in my definition black technically has a type 2 on on g7 right i sound like a dentist now is the g7 bishop vulnerable no because white has no pieces there okay so this is all only important if it's relevant now a defended piece is a piece that is protected by a pawn or by more than one piece okay this knight is defended this bishop is defended okay now again this is just something i created to facilitate making the right observations now here's the thing when this position is reached how does my how does my brain process the position that's on the board well there's a couple of things i notice the first is you guys all see this right the x-ray but then and this is the key bishop on e2 what kind of a bishop is it using our categorization is it defended it's a type addicting heir thank you for the prime it's a type 2. how about the bishop on a4 what can you tell me about this bishop it's a type 2 now the queen i told you i'd talk about that later the queen is always undefended no matter how many pawns or pieces are in contact with it the reason the queen is always undefended is because when the queen is attacked by any piece other than another queen it must move does that make sense so you can have 50 pieces quote-unquote defending it but it's still going to have to move because it's the most valuable piece so there's three undefended pieces in sort of the same zip code that's why i see knight h5 and this bishop type 2 undefended only the knight is defending it we chop the legs off and we win the bishop that's sort of the logic hopefully that makes sense and the rest is very straightforward okay um that's i don't know about that luke but you can go pretty far i think uh does queen before for him there defend i don't think it does i think he's pretty much busted uh queen before is the same exact thing we take the knight sorry we take the bishop or we could have also taken the knight first and then take the knight um so honestly i think this is an underestimated way of thinking about certain positions you can do a lot by simply constantly harping on the type one and type two undefended pieces in a position and if you guys just give me one moment please let me see if i can find a very quick illustrative game from my own chess career like can you actually you know prac do you actually practice what you preach daniel you might be asking and i try to when possible let me see if i can oh let me see if i can find a game from early in my chess career where i did something like that ah yes i can actually i remember a nice little combination i had which sort of exploits this concept 2005 november 5th four days before my 10th birthday this position appears on the board i'm playing a 1400 yes i was 1800 once bishop takes f3 so it looks like everything is fine for white right i mean material is equal we can trade bishops but what does that really do right but here's the thing what can you guys tell me about this bishop what kind of a piece is it it's a type 2 undefended piece only the rook is defending which means it's incredibly vulnerable to tactics and the move is rook to d1 distracting the rook from f1 it's got to take my opponent resigned because now i pick up the bishop and simultaneously fork the rook so there's another tactical idea that's involved here but you spot this by initially understanding that the bishop on f3 is incredibly vulnerable as is the rook on f1 this is the type 1 undefended piece so both are exploited here if only white's king was let's say on g2 none of this would have worked that's how important this difference is to make why does bishop d3 not work for white in a situation oh so any questions by the way about this game so type 1 is a piece that's not defended by any pieces type 2 is a piece that is defended by only one other piece and not a pawn uh mycon asks when you move bishop c6 why couldn't you activate the rook by going rook to t8 a fantastic question so and i'm actually sorry i'm not sure where oh because the reason is because this would have self-pinned me right and now i can't move the bishop away because the rook on date is going to be hanging you got to be careful about that he could even put pressure on the bishop and i might even lose this bishop black has ways to get out of this but that's basically the reason right why did 94 not work in that position another great question thank you for uh being brave 94 did work kind of but he could have dropped his queen back to d3 and the problem is even though the bishop 2 is a type 2 undefended piece there's no other undefended piece to exploit the two bishops are not forkable what's wrong with e5 instead of knight f6 well the movie e5 here is the england gambit that's not a great opening but it's possible why are pieces covered by a pawn automatically defended in another fantastic question that's the the last question that will move on um so here's the logic right here is the logic um and once again let's take a skeleton position on chess space okay so essentially yes there are no kings on the board i'm just trying to illustrate a concept here okay so basically now my ocd is coming in i gotta gotta make sure the board is perfect now i gotta make sure my webcam is flush with the board because i can't look at this yeah it's gotta be perfect even though this is gonna take me about two seconds to show there we go you guys you guys know what i mean right i mean perfect okay um here's the thing um you see that the bishops are in a standoff right bishops are gonna stand up now let's consider two distinct situations number one let's move black's pawn out to b7 okay does black's bishop and let's let's say that white spawn is on g2 does either bishop have to move like is either bishop actually threatened here yes or no no no because the pawns are defending each pawn their respective bishop now let's consider a different scenario let's consider a scenario where instead of that pawn on b7 black had a knight on d8 guarding the bishop panda panic thank you for panic thank you for the prime what can white now try to do in order to remove the defender can you guys give me both moves that accomplish this task bishop b6 is one of them bishop g5 is the other exactly and the other ones just kidding i can this is a cool feature in the new chess space i can make illegal moves and i can even take my own pieces but anyways uh that's sort of the bottom line now if we compare these two situations right do you guys see how much harder it is to undermine a pawn than to attack a piece that's the bottom line you can't undermine this point if you had a pawn on a5 you could have done this potentially but this is very hard to orchestrate that is why uh that is why i think that you know pawns protecting a piece are the safest form of defense so that's why we call them defended okay so let's play something different okay let's play a modern uh modern is the move g so that's like a king's indian against e4 it's an opening that i have played for many years now this is different than a king's indian in the king's indian white goes c4 so i can transpose the game into the king's indian but you should be careful about assuming that this is the same thing this opening is quite a bit more dubious than the king's indian but it's still a very reputable opening you know it's not it's not been refuted once again if you guys are paying attention to my explanation of hyper modern openings this is a literally called the modern because look at what we're allowing white to do we're allowing white to build massive control of the center what we're going to do in return after developing our pieces is attack that center from a distance thank you cloud nine point so now we're gonna castle we're going to develop and white has several ways yep so he plays the annoying move we're going to take the pawn and our fundamental strategy here is going to be to somehow find a way to undermine this pawn chain but first our knight is hanging where should we put this knight so that it remains active knight d7 97 is a little bit passive although that might be the theoretical move but knight h5 knights on the rim are grim 98 is passive knight g4 allows him to chase that knight to the rim with h3 knight d5 is the move don't disqualify a move just because it leads to a trade trades can be good in fact this one is he goes bishop c4 that's a good move and now a very instructive moment should we or should we not take on c3 what do you guys say well i'm going to tell you this we shouldn't we shouldn't because even though he uh has doubled pawns and i'll explain this in greater depth after the game what happens as a consequence is that the pawn on c3 lends support to the pawn on d4 that creates a pawn chain so we're basically helping him uh buttress the pawn so instead we're going to go bishop to e6 developing the bishop and defending the knight we're going to keep the blockade on d5 going strong okay so knight take c3 is only a move that we're going to make if we get desperate if we have to take on c3 but remember people sometimes get obsessed with doubled pawns the way to think about double pawn they can be actually good he just made a big mistake what did he just allow he miscalculated he's gonna lose two pawns in the end we'll look at the bishop type one undefended type one undefended piece there's a standoff boom goes the dynamite that's a discovered attack now he saw this he saw this knight takes c6 that's his idea and the thing is if we take his knight that's out of the question he takes ours but of course we take the queen he takes our queen we take his knight what he didn't see was that d4 is now hanging we have succeeded in our strategy we have literally we have won both of his central pawns that's the ideal scenario we are going to be up two puns in the end game okay so he tries to trick us here um that's actually not a bad move at all that's quite an interesting move i should say let me calculate for a second guys let me actually think before i make any recommendations because there's several things that we can consider doing here okay we're fine so what should we do what we should do is number one we should ask ourselves can we defend the knight can we defend the knight we can roof takes d4 now the reason i was hesitant here i'm not trying to flex the name i was genuinely trying to calculate this out is because of this nasty little check right our king is a little bit in trouble here even without the queens i had to make sure that there were no shenanigans in relation to the in relation to the to the king so he goes c3 to chase away the rook oh but he found a really nice idea which i actually miss he's going to go bishop b3 that is actually brilliant by him he's opening up a little window to the night he's going to win back the night that's not a problem though the reason oh he doesn't do it he should have done that he would have still been in very big trouble had that happened what does he allow us to now to do and this i calculated this i saw this is what i had actually expected we can take b2 that knight is a very slippery piece he does take c7 but it's not a problem we move a rook to c8 i know it looks scary but remember we are up a piece the queens are off the board and look at this trooper here on g7 it's covering everything up it's making everything safe and he's gonna run out of gas it's just crucial that we develop very fast right we don't want to dilly dally any longer we want to make sure that we get our pieces out super super fast and i really mean it in fact what move can we now make do not automatically assume that you have to move the knight what can we do knight d3 is possible but in the interest of rapid development we can simply go knight to c6 undefended pieces type one knight c6 trades are in our favor we've linked up the rooks we can take a deep breath we're chilling we're living we're grooving and now we can remove remove our knight from b2 and go after the c5 pawn he can push that pawn to e6 but that's why we deployed our knight to c6 it's not going any further than that okay well he's taken b7 which is possible but now we can chop the legs off of that pawn and all we need to do now is be a little bit careful because he's got some pinning ideas and some action here what should we do to you know reduce some of the you know turn the volume the volume dial down a little bit on the heat we should go rook b8 and chase after this rook now then i didn't mean a premium of that the knights defend each other which is an ideal scenario but we also need to be careful if he had a pawn on f2 right if he had a pawn on f2 he would have gone f4 and then we would have been uh in trouble so let's take the rook here we can just keep the knights like this because they're unassailable he's not actually threatening anything right so that makes sense to you guys he's not actually threatening to take either one of the knights because they're completely self-sufficient so we can infiltrate to the second rank and he resigns great game okay so what happened the modern g6 fiance the bishop now the first time that the modern was actually played and again i love to give you guys these multiple choice questions uh historical now in recorded history do you guys think that the modern was played in for the first time in it i'm going to give you a multiple choice 1700 1800 approximately 1850 1900 or 1950 1700 increments of 50 17 1750 18 1850 19 1950. it's called the modern okay a lot of you guys are hitting it right on the money i'm seeing the right answer more often than not the modern was first played by a guy named pierre charles sentiment he was one of the strongest players of the 19th century was first played in london in 1842 by sandman against john cochran and he didn't play it quite in the way that we do now it was then played in 1852 1880 and by the early 1900s by the by the second half of the 20th century it had become very commonplace so you could have counted on one hand the amount of times basically that it was played before 1950 those were some brave souls so santa mancapo blanca played it a lot of interesting people played it i've played it many times myself now he played what's called the austrian attack why is it called the austrian attack i don't actually know um i guess maybe it was first played in austria let's do some investigating this this move f4 was first played in 1951 in switzerland so not quite in austria it was first played in the in in switzerland by a very good player joseph copper and i think he might have been austrian no he was swiss i don't know maybe that's the austrian swiss attack is what it should have maybe been called but uh openings are not always named after the first person who played them this will be on the test anyways e5 pushing is pawn we take it blockade on d5 i hope it made sense my explanation why we didn't put the knight anywhere else and now why not knight takes c3 people consistently underestimate sorry overestimate how good it is to have your opponents have doubled pawns in fact i tell this story often when i was growing up in the san francisco mechanics institute chess club there was a guy named arthur was about 1700 he was a good club player arthur had a literal phobia of doubled pawns he would he would take you know the most insane measures to avoid having a pair of double puzzle double pawns can be good look at this you open up the b file for him good point you allow him to have a pawn chain and okay the pawns are ugly you're not gonna invite these pawns to prom but that's fine right because they do other other stuff okay bishop e6 what should he have done to make sure that this standoff is not going to just kill him here this is a very typical move and if you guys are paying attention to my demonstration of defended and undefended pieces on chessbase you can connect the dots here bishop e3 is exactly right now queen e2 is fine but then the bishop is only a type 2. bishop b3 and look at how secure this bishop is you're never going to have to worry about losing it that's what white should have done knight g5 knight takes c3 now if he takes on d1 and that's probably what he missed boom boom and we're up two pawns in the end game yeah so e6 and c6 are both possible e6 creates some weaknesses so between those two moves i actually think c6 might be the main move okay why not bishop takes knight there where i'm not sure where you meet where where are you referring to anyways he goes castles uh pawn to p3 would be fine uh except it would it would but but you would hang the knight right you would create another undefended piece make sure that when you're trying to solve a problem in chess make sure that you're not creating another one in its place very typical cause of blunders if you're troubleshooting you're like okay there's one thing i need to solve here make sure that you're not tunnel visioning right a words that are in charlie's nightmares tunnel visioning is when you zero in too much on one particular concept forgetting about others so castles brook takes d4 bishop f7 kings now here he should have gone bishop b3 and you guys can see that this knight is trapped now when your piece is trapped you shouldn't panic what you should try to do is figure out whether you can give that piece up for the maximum amount of material so what does that mean there's two possible moves knight c3 knight b2 now knight p2 helps him develop we don't want to help our opponent develop so knight takes c3 is the move bishop takes c5 birch thank you for the sub phd you see always logical so here it looks scary but there's nothing if he goes bishop e6 by the way it looks like the rook is trapped but now we have this square and we skewer the bishops so here knight c6 not nothing automatic no knee-jerk reactions developing the knight and now the smoke clears we trade the rooks we infiltrate to the second rank and we win the game why not rook d7 instead of rook c8 um why not rook d7 instead of rook c8 oh yeah rook t7 was possible but i was a little bit concerned about leaving that back rank unattended although i don't think he actually has anything this would have been possible so something like this was what concerned me and then he can play the move e6 with tempo also i thought maybe i'd leave the d7 square available for them why did he resign because he's down a piece in an end game which is quite an overwhelming advantage at this level
