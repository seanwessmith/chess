i have not yet lost but i will eventually lose i mean probably you know any time now i'm already over 2 000 so eventually someone will come around who catches a blunder or something like that okay we're gonna go with another e4 game [Music] the openings are less important here than the games themselves though and now we're going to play lopez which is my main opening that's sort of the high level defense okay and he plays the berlin now um there's many ways to play against the berlin but we're gonna go straight into it and we're going to go into the end game uh we're going to go into the berlin end game because i want to show you guys that it's not just a draw it really okay he doesn't go for the berlin he does not go for the bull and he goes d6 which is a very passive move but that's like the stein it's defense that's a legitimate variation and previously we'd been responding earlier by going c3 and d4 but now we're at a higher rating let's play more topically let's play d4 immediately opening up the center why do we open up the center because he's played passively so in order to exploit that we want to maximally open things up so that we can emphasize our advantage in development now the theory in this position is to capture on c6 with the bishop keeping our knight centralized making a little defect defect in his queen side pawn structure now here's the thing what do we want to do he wants to play c5 to dislodge our knight from the center right and it would be very very nice if we could put our knight on f5 but if we put our knight on f5 let's say right now then he will capture that knight and if we capture with the pawn uh that makes our king side pawn structure bad and it removes upon from the center b4 would be a little bit artificial because that would weaken the night it would weaken the pawn we don't actually need to prevent c5 what we need to do is we need to prepare the move knight f5 in response to it remember that prophylaxis can come from both directions you can prevent the move itself but you can also prepare a response against the move and queen f3 is the best way to do that because that is also conducive to the general goals of the position you simply bring a queen a piece onto a better square and we can continue to do that by bringing the bishop in we don't have to go knight f5 yet we we can only do that in response to c5 now we have a lot of pressure on his position he goes knight g4 okay so hmm let me think yeah so we can win a pawn here we have a cool way of winning upon who sees it yeah so the knight on g4 what jumps to mind for me actually it doesn't win a pawn there's ooh there's some really cool complications it actually does not win upon never mind and i'll show you guys this after the game um scrap that scrap that i'll show you guys why it doesn't win a pawn but not right now because uh because our time is ticking so let's take the bishop and obviously this knight is super annoying so let's kick it away let's go h3 get out of here get out of here now where should we move our queen in the interest of the fact that we are trying to attack his king where should we position our queen what's sort of the typical square of the typical squares of course g3 and potentially we can chase the knight away with f4 although i would i i would not play this move prematurely okay so he's gone c5 in such situations we always ask ourselves first and foremost what squares does a move like this leave behind obviously knight f5 was what we previously attended now it's not quite as strong but there is the move knight d5 and noticing the queen and now we can go knight f5 i previously said that it's not ideal that we have a pawn that lands on f5 but the situation has changed a little bit now this pawn is actually an asset why is it an asset because we can go f6 and combine with the queen let's apply the same logic f6 what square does this weaken can we get a piece to that square tell me the maneuver exactly knight f4 and knight e6 very methodical look at this juicy outpost on e6 with the knight his knight on e5 is not on an outpost we can always chase it away by playing f4 we don't need to rush with that move but when the time comes we can play that move f4 now why shouldn't we rush with that move there's a deep logic behind this what do we not want him to do what we don't want him to do is to trade off this knight and the only way that he can trade off this night is by using his own knight okay so what we want to do dr along with job is rookie one we are anticipating that he's eventually going to try to trade off the knights and so we're adding some beef to that knight in preparation for that now we go rookie for dual purpose move number one we can double to lend more supports than a number two we can rook left that would be another drawback of the move out four we would prevent our own ability to rook lift okay so he he loses his patience decides to exchange sacrifice but the hesitation should tell you that he's realized that he missed something and that is the move f4 of course attacking the queen it's not that simple he can move his queen away and attack the knight but i saw that this is also why we played rookie four let's not forget the other purpose what's the move what's the move now we play the simple the simple darker thank you for the sub well queen e3 would violate the small principle we talk about which is that when you have a task that you can do with one piece you should usually do it with that piece rather than the queen the queen should be left at the sort of most important tasks we double rooks and we get to e8 if he moves his knight away yeah backrank mate is not going to happen cleanly because he can get his knight to f8 but he's going to be driven very much to the back but let's not rush and this is the importance of not rushing i a lot of people would immediately give a check on ea but we need to spend a couple seconds in any position asking ourselves like is there something better is there something that maybe wins the game in a slightly cleaner way and that is the rookie seven rookie also wins but he has knight fa and somehow he's holding on there i could go rookie seven but what i want to show is that principle right you spent three four five seconds nobody's died over three four five seconds and uh we find a move that ends the game immediately because we have a fork against uh the knight in the pawn and the game is over so he loses his knight he loses the game very simple sort of straightforward applying principles by the book and that can produce some very effective chess now let's do piggies on the seventh and um he goes richard so he continues to play he's completely lost how do we win this position there are several approaches i think the most again if we're playing this by the book the simplest approach is to try to get a rook on on this on the eighth rank uh and in order to do that we finally involve our queen we go queen e3 and rookie a that would be the most sort of you know kind of like okay it's not the best but it's the simplest right we trade rooks and when we trade rocks the win is going to be super simple we don't need to take immediately either we can first help ourselves to a couple pawns that's going to lighten our load a little bit i'm sure that there were faster wins but again part of the the in the speed run i'm never playing badly on purpose but sometimes i'm playing uh differently than i would normally play in order to illustrate the range of ideas available to us now instead of trading rooks well we can actually just go rook c8 here that would be the simplest we take he's actually kind of hanging on here which is kind of funny but we can give a check here and now the simple idea would be to get a rook to the sixth rank how can we get the rook to e6 we want the rook to get to e6 how do we do that who can tell me rookie 8 and rookie 6 is going to end the game one way or another it's going to be either checkmate or it's going to win the queen rookie 6 queen h4 queen f7 is going to be mate and queen f7 here he's going to be a pretty mate we can even troll him a little bit if he goes king h4 if he goes king h4 we control him by taking on h6 or what's going to be the actual checkmate who can tell me what the mate is going to be let's see if i can ah let me let me do some professional trolling let me do some professional trolling i was gonna go i was gonna sack my queen i was gonna go here and and then here but uh sadly he didn't didn't allow us to to do that um i was gonna see if we have a way of sacrificing both the rook and the queen that would be pretty cool but no okay let's look at the game so the berlin is knight take c4 uh we won't delve into the theory here god forbid uh but uh the the berlin the idea behind the berlin is is this end game right you guys all probably know that this leads to the berlin end game and at some point i might talk a little bit about the berlin game uh you know i might talk a little bit about the berlin game uh but but not right now this is you know extremely theoretical so he goes d6 which is kind of um which is kind of passive and d4 directly follows the principle of opening up the center when our opponent plays a little bit passively why is this move passive because well because it prevents his bishop from developing to c5 which is the most active square this is not a bad line i've played d6 myself but it's a little bit um you know it it it is something that you have to play if you know it very well because you can easily slip into a bad position which is essentially what happens so take stakes bishop d7 knight c3 developing bishop e7 uh bishop takes c6 which is the theoretical move right uh we are trading bishop for night leaving our knight in the center and forcing him to introduce a defect into his spawn structure if he takes with a bishop we can take that bishop or we could consider putting the knight on f5 straight away so he takes to the pawn and we go queen f3 now when would you play c3 before d4 so we could have played c3 even in this line it's often a matter of taste here i wanted to just illustrate a slightly different way of playing now um the idea behind queen f3 as i explained during the game if we make just any random move he goes c5 and we have to drop our knight back because if we go knight f5 he takes on f5 and this is actually quite unpleasant right we don't want to get our pawn to f5 which is nicely blockaded by the knight and can be easily attacked by the queen and our pawn on e4 was controlling the center so now he has this an kind of nasty idea well defense and pawn structure actually don't matter that much and that's something i've been explaining throughout uh it's just that the higher you get right the more and i explained this the last time the more importance is assigned to these small factors because small factors when taken together uh can decide the game and one of those small factors is differences in pawn structure while they don't usually decide the outcome of the game in and of themselves you you know you don't just want to make free weaknesses if that makes sense so queen f3 preparing to get the knight to f5 so that we can capture with the queen okay he castles we go bishop g5 and he goes knight g4 now here a lot of you were wondering why i didn't play knight takes c6 and the the point of this move is it's a simple overloading tactic the bishop on d7 is doing two things at once it cannot um accomplish them it's defending the knight and it was protecting the pawn so we take the pawn overloading the bishop now bishop takes c6 problem is we cannot take the knight immediately because uh he he plays bishop takes g5 and wins a piece now we're also attacking the queen here so if he takes immediately then we win as queen but it seems that white can simply take the bishop on e7 and now i started thinking about intermediate moves and black is a desperado sacrifice the knight is hanging he's going to lose it anyway so he might as well give it up for a pawn but it's very important that this move also attacks white's queen so if we count up the pieces queen knight bishop takes queen knight takes queen we get an equal pawn end game white's got a ruined kingside pawn structure not impressive of course we can also take the knight but then black takes the bishop and black's bishop is super good here it's pressuring the pawn black and combine that with f5 so this moon knight takes h2 what did i say about details defining games at this level that's what i mean now you might be rated a thousand and hopefully i've explained this in a way where you should understand the rationale behind this line right it's not that it's impossible to understand but calculating this in the heat of a game can be difficult really that's all there is to it it's not that it's particularly complicated now if you and if you take on e7 first and i take c6 now it's well it's actually different why is knight takes h2 not the same thing who can explain to me why this is not the same thing first of all and second of all for extra credit what is black's move in this position similar concept knight takes queen comes with check and even if it didn't this square is undefended so what should black do instead very nasty little move what black can do here is and i'm not sure how bad this is but queen h4 is what i didn't like he's attacking mate and threatening c6 it gets complicated i decided not to go for that good job so we played h3 chasing the knight away reposition the queen on g3 where x-rays the king c5 what is the drawback of this move a high weakens d5 can we go there immediately no we can't knight is being attacked but wait a second yes we can because it attacks the queen could we have gone knight f5 yes absolutely not a bad move takes takes but i was a little bit worried about trading too many pieces remember that when you're up in space and when you're trying to attack trades can lighten the load for your opponent so you know i just wasn't sure i didn't think this was a necessary thing to do immediately and this would not have been bad can you explain the decision to trade dark square bishops well uh you know i suppose we could have dipped our bishop back but i didn't want to let him activate his bishop and put it on the long diagonal so this isn't something i'm like i love to do but the alternative wastes more time and it allows him to put his bishop on a super good square okay uh so anyways so queen g3 c5 knight t5 and now we play knight f5 and it's very important as i've preached several times to use the method of comparison to understand the differences between two different things compare them don't try to understand each individually that can be tough comparison can yield tremendous levels of instruction about a set of ideas or a certain position and specifically here i want you to compare this position to this position in both positions we've got this little defect in our pawn structure three pawns here and upon an f5 doubled but there's one key difference as i hinted at during the game what is that difference there's many differences of course but um there's one difference that makes this good for white well number one the queen is more active that's that's an ancillary phenomenon but all of this is leading up to the fact that the pawn is not blockaded and it actually wants to go to f6 even if he goes c6 we go f6 because we threaten checkmate forcing him to either create tremendous weaknesses in his kingside which sets up a potential lobster pincermate or create weaknesses in his king side like this when we can basically coordinate for a second away with the attack so this one difference again small differences make the game go make the world go round he plays f6 to blockade the pawn but now he creates a massive weakness on e6 which we occupy immediately now the move f4 very tempting wrong because it actually helps him get his knight to d8 and trade off our knight so what we do is we preemptively play rookie one f4 is not going anywhere his knight alone is not going to cause any problems to us right and um we're only going to go out for when we are ready to protect this knight in addition uh we are preparing to lift our rope why rookie wouldn't well d1 orwell would not really uh go about defending this night uh you know he can move his queen away i get that you wanted to pin the queen but this rook is kind of lame and i can't lift it because d4 square is protected absolutely why did i choose a rook and not the f1 i'll put it this way guys i think in this specific case both moves are perfectly fine but visually and i went by my intuition here it just seemed a good idea to keep another rook near my king for whatever reason i wasn't exactly even sure why but i thought that maybe you know maybe when i play f4 this rook will somehow maneuver through f3 to g3 it's a minuscule difference i think this was just as good but there was something about that particular concept that i liked that's really all there is to it i don't think it really matters here it's it doesn't make a huge difference in every case you shouldn't overthink it uh so now we go rookie four as planned and he loses his patience now i already think he's basically lost if he tries to get his knight around to trade we can do two things we can lift our rook up and we can follow that up who can tell me a very very powerful attacking idea here white wins the game with a very pretty tactical sequence queen g6 h6 and now we notice type 2 on defended pieces rook h7 i don't think quite does the trick we notice that black's queen is overloaded knight takes g7 overloading very important rope takes h6 is a little more complicated i think you've got to be careful here i don't see a follow-up here remember when you only have two pieces in the attack be super careful about sacrificing keeping it simple often pays a lot of dividends in the end so he goes rookie six and now f4 either wins the night or uh allows us to infiltrate the back two ranks a rookie 8 would have also been perfectly good uh but we decided to play it very simple and just win as night the rest is the rest is very straightforward okay it would take c7 broke cc8 forcing the trade on our terms and that basically ends the game what if he plays rook g8 where oh at the end of that line well if he plays rook g8 we just check made up on h6 right once we take a pawn like this we remove the bottom jenga and the whole thing collapses any questions about this game i feel like it was relatively simple conceptually and i want to show you guys one really really instructive moment from one of my games that builds on a concept that we that we talked about here the concept that we talked about here is the notion of supporting an outpost right we had this outpost on e6 and our opponent expressed the desire to treat it by maneuvering migrating his knight to d8 and that can actually change the game whether or not we can retain a piece on an outpost can can really be the game-changing phenomenon and so one of the hardest things to do in chess one of the things that you do you learn to do when you become good is to find creative ways of maintaining a piece on a particular square particularly maintaining a knight on an outpost and i had the chance to do that in a game that i played a couple years ago when i was in im and i believe that i found a very very nice idea which i'd like to show you guys this game is from philadelphia open 2013. i made my second grandmaster norm at this tournament and uh the following position arose in round two i am playing with the white pieces my opponent 2100 in this position i found a very nice tactical idea i call this a positional combination because it's tactical in nature but the goal is positional it's like a tactical maneuver and it's not that difficult to see if you make the proper observations for keeping that going so drum roll the move is knight d4 and the idea is to get the knight to e6 and uh once the knight gets on e6 that's a beautiful outpost it's protected by the pawn now there's a couple of things that uh that need to be explained about this but philly boy 44. some people notice that the move knight h4 creates two threats knight takes f5 and knight g6 problem with this move is that um and let me actually remember what the problem with this move is uh knight's rule is actually not bad but but there was something i think i can play queen f7 and if you take the pawn you expose a very nasty little attack down the f file black can move his knight away and uh if white's knight moves then queen takes f2 is going to be quite unpleasant this is not bad but it leads to some uh questionable consequences now the key question about knight d4 what makes this tactical is the fact that you have to evaluate knight takes d5 but what you guys have to understand is that this puts the knight and the king on the same diagonal and the move bishop b3 is going to be absolutely devastating the knight is being attacked queen f7 is the only defense and now queen f3 is a simple move that wins not only this night but also the other night you're gonna win both nights with the bishop there it is now why is bishop e3 immediately bad the reason is that in basketball you know you can telegraph the pass you know when you when you go like this you know exactly who who you're going to pass it to and you signal to your opponent hey i want to play knight t496 what's the opponent going to do bonus good no you're not oh you i'm going to move my queen queen to d7 guess what the only reason that knight d4 was possible was because of the temporary phenomenon of the pit and that's something you have to exploit immediately knight d4 does that make sense okay 2796 rook fe-8 now now he does threaten to take on d5 because he's gonna chop the legs off of the knife so queen f3 is what i played okay knight takes d5 i'm gonna take with the bishop witho the queen now he goes knight to d8 here's what the battle revolves around is he gonna be able to trade that knight on e6 and obviously the answer is yes there's nothing i can do about the trade but what do i do what do i do in this position in order to make sure that that knight is going to be replaced by something even stronger bishop3 is correct queen takes f5 would be inferior on the count of knight takes d5 and the knight loses its support so i go bishop b3 right and if he takes on e6 i take with the pawn he has to move his queen and look at this beaut on e6 it's not a knight but it's the next best thing okay uh and after rook a7 i play queen takes f5 and he plays king h8 and in this position i found the move uh and the reason that i'm showing you this game consists in this move now what is my opponent threatening why did he play king h8 the move that he played here is knight takes the move that he intends is knight takes d5 this is a simple undermining sacrifice well not a sacrifice sorry tactic you cannot take this knight because the queen is pinned and if you play bishop takes d5 then he plays knight 66 restoring material equality and i know and most importantly i no longer have an outpost on e6 so i've really achieved very little here uh well yeah dirty devin i'll mention that later but my question then is man i really want to keep this knight on e6 you know i really i don't want to just give it away and i can't take on d8 because the queen hangs if you go knight takes g7 then he's just gonna take on g7 with the queen or the king by the way so what the hell do we do and in this position i was able to find the kind of thing that i described to you guys prophylaxis in a tactical way so nobody's seen the move yet actually now let me tell you how was how i was able to find the move this is hard guys and g4 i would say is probably the second best move although it's a little weakening now the way that i thought about it is this let's imagine and i call this the worst case scenario test when you're trying to find a prophylactic move that is when you're trying to find a way to stop your opponent's threat and it's not obvious how to stop it what i suggest doing is first assuming that your opponent accomplishes that you let him do whatever he wanted to do all right you and i'll get to people's suggestions in a moment you let him do what he wants to do and you think okay let's fork let's broadcast to the final position and let's look at this for a second what move could white potentially have here what would it be nice if white had in this position he can't make this move but what would it be nice yeah bishop c6 wouldn't it be nice if you could play bishop c6 and bend the queen to the rook and i thought wait a second i can set this up and so in the starting position rook a to c1 is the move and this move i was quite proud of this is and i think you guys would agree with me not only is this prophylactic but it brings a piece into the game it's a productive move as a standalone move and it prevents knight takes d5 he did this anyway so i'll show you guys what happened in the game but that's how i thought about it and that's the logic that i want you guys to apply in many many different cases i can give you another test position where that logic is applied directly now some of you okay knight d4 is a very interesting move but it fails tactically because after ed queen d7 rook d7 the knight defends the rook on e8 now g4 i think is quite good and i really like that people came up with this the idea being after knight takes d5 knight takes d the queen is protected and so bishop takes d5 is going to follow i love that mode g4 is probably almost as good i would say that it's a tiny bit weakening on the king's side so maybe he can do something like this and you know he's still kicking because because we've got some of these weaknesses but i think g4 is also very very good rocket thank you for the sub queen h5 blunders the queen and uh i think the other moves have you know small tactical defects queen f3 is also very good but i wanted to keep my queen active maybe here he plays knight f7 and tries to get his knight to g5 so rookie c1 he took on d5 and then bishop c6 happened and now i play the move queen e4 and d4 much like we did in that speed run game the idea being if knight takes d4 queen d4 because of the pin he loses so knight take rook takes c5 and he resigned in this position uh that basically was why i wanted to show you this game this idea of working backwards starting from the final position trying to set up an idea that could have occurred in that final position is uh is an interesting one and let me show you guys one more example of me doing that and then we'll play one last game so i had one other example that i can remember where i managed and i was quite proud of doing this where i did something similar okay so this is my game from 2006 against an international master he was also my first coach okay so this guy was good it was a night off yeah that's what i used to play okay that's what i used to play and um in this position i was able to find what i think is a really nice prophylactic idea now in order to understand this what is the purpose of the move h4 what is my opponent's next move going to be and i'm not asking a trick question here obvious question i mean just go on no not no don't overthink it h4 what does he want h5 he wants to play h5 you know let's play h5 and then he wants to play h6 i don't want to allow this i don't want him to do this i also don't want to play h6 because that creates a hook which you can then use to play g5 using the pawn as a battering ram so i applied the same logic and i asked myself okay wait a second let's imagine that he plays h5 and let's try to detect thank you wolf what new weaknesses in his position are created well wait a second i thought this is a type 2 undefended bishop it's only protected by the queen that seems like a vulnerable piece could i try to preemptively set up a tactic against that bishop in the event of h5 thank you jose mvp with the rate of the party of 51 really appreciate it hope you had a great team welcome guys we're doing the speed run we're doing some lectures and you guys are getting it the move is queen to d8 i was really proud of this move during the game move his queen to d a now it's not necessarily the best move according to the computer what is the idea the idea is if he goes h5 then i play knight takes e4 and exposes the attack on the bishop if bishop takes e7 this is a check and if rook takes c4 then i play bishop takes g5 and i win the pawn uh this would not have been possible without the queen on d8 because i would not have had enough attacks on the bishop he would have simply recaptured it segfaulting for the prime appreciate it now queen c5 would also do that with the same idea uh and i think queen c5 would have been interesting but maybe here he goes bishop e3 and he x-rays the queen in the game he also played bishop b3 and i had time to maneuver my queen to maneuver my pieces i didn't have to move my queen knight d7 f4 and back to f6 and i was able to slam my knight in t but this is not a trick i mean does this look like i'm going for tricks no this is i think this is pretty high level prophylaxis i'm actually trying to stop his ideas and and i won the game so i'm not saying this is the best uh but i'm trying to give you guys an example of this kind of backwards thinking you assume that your opponent accomplishes his threat and then you try to detect retroactively the drawbacks of that and then you try to i was meaning to say retroactively exploit them in the starting position clear okay let's move on i know that i'm dragging on about this but hopefully it's somewhat helpful and let's uh finish with uh one more one more speed run game okay at what age did you first beat a master i think it was like probably 2004 maybe eight or nine [Music] you
