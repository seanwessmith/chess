[Music] let's do it okay 1368 from russia all right so i'm going to jettison the bishop here with bishop a3 all right i know i know you guys will laugh but okay this is a serious experiment so okay i'm down a bishop all right i'm down a bishop now what do i do first of all you don't want to go crazy and give up all the rest of your pieces right you're already down a piece and this is true also when you blunder i see this all the time somebody blunders a piece and then they immediately oh okay i'll sack the rook in two rooks and i'll just pretend this was a sacrifice let me lose the game like two more moves there's no need to you know own up to your blunder right don't try to pretend that you saw it and i have really funny stories with that and then sacrifice more pieces out of some sense of necessity now okay queen f3 now what does he want what does he want he wants to take on f6 and potentially he's clearly trying to trade right but let's use that to our advantage right because here's what i notice folks when he takes on f6 with his bishop that rook on a1 is a little bit weird and he's got a bunch of these dark squares right around his position that are kind of flimsy so i'm going to go queen e7 here i'm going to tempt him into taking on f6 because what i what that gives me the chance to do is take with a pawn why is taking with the pawn good doesn't it amen tie it seems like i'm ruining my pawn structure but this is actually potentially a blessing in disguise because what advantage does this pawn structure give me well first of all of course i avoid the queen trade i mean i can't trade queens well it gives me the g file and i also have the b file so let's think about what i can do here one thing that i can do here to try to muddy the waters right and win back some of this material look at this pawn on e4 in the time that his king is still in the center i can try to exploit that in my favor by the way guys the move queen e5 doesn't actually do very much due to knight c3 so i can go either d5 or i can go f5 i can go either d5 or f5 i will go d5 i would have personally got f5 uh were i playing alone but uh this is a more thematic move and by the way don't rush to take the pawn on e4 because taking the pawn on e4 notice opens up the diagonal for his bishop i want to take this pawn on my terms what does that mean what move do i think about playing then and this f5 right we want to play f take c4 and establish a pawn chain so that his bishop remains locked up so we have already won a pawn back and as people have indicated we have that g-file that we can use to stir things up on the king's side let's try to stir things up on the king's side crook g8 no rocket science here i'm just trying to do what i can i'm still lost i mean king h1 he's very good uh and the other thing is that despite being down material that doesn't mean we throw caution to the wind and we just violate all principles right we still want to develop our pieces uh and and we won't get any anywhere without developing our pieces and enhancing the quality of this pawn chain i do actually like the move f5 oh i actually really like the move f5 so let's actually go f5 to really just cement our control over the center because that's the only thing we have but now let's develop our bishop uh and potentially prepare castling long although i don't think i'm gonna do that okay now i see an opportunity we can attack the pawn on g2 and people have realized that queen to g7 are right now if he goes g3 that would already be a mistake he's got to go queen g3 but that is not an easy move to find and already he is in a little bit of trouble because if he goes g3 and i think he's realized it wow this guy is really good actually so what do we do now notice that the queen is the worst defender the queen is the worst defender i cannot repeat that enough what can we do here where can we go with our queen in order to keep yep queen h8 or we can go queen f6 right a little bit more active uh hello grant uh well i would ask the same of you and and here's what's going on what's going on and queen h8 would have been actually better now than i think about it we're attacking his queen his queen is on a very thin line with his knight but if we go f4 and open up the attack on the queen he has knight takes e4 and i will explain that after the game so this is the time for us to do what we need to make a move before we play f4 and this move we have prepared precisely for this kind of eventuality we need to castle we need to get our king out don't worry i will explain this after the game why is f4 bad but this guy is extremely underrated he's seeing some pretty cool tactical ideas okay so he's got 92 well we gotta throw our lots in the center of the table let's go four ooh there's a really cool idea oh my lens oh my goodness there is a really cool idea i'm just gonna make the move right now and i will explain it later because i want him to think that we have blundered our queen in reality this is the other thing thank you sicilian salad and joshua yalday for the sub oh my goodness now who can spot who another queen sack who can spot the sequence who can spot the sequence in its entirety fake bow test gambit it was a sacrifice made in three what's the first move can somebody give me the whole line yes f takes g2 now what we can even make a rook double check forcing his king on to f1 and bishop h3 is mate this is checkmate all right so how did i come up with this tactic well here's the thing i will i will make i mean that was a yeah i mean this is a cool tactic but honestly he should have he should have suspected something now well i appreciate it yeah the hype is real so yeah the guy is uh he's i wonder what he's doing right now 100 bits thank you uh kk detroit for the support uh he could have done g3 but then i would have won my uh brought my queen aside and this pawn is very dangerous so the the advice that i can share on the basis of this is that you want to when you've blundered when you're down a piece you want your opponent to believe that you're basically tilted and blundering more that's where these tactics come from he feels like i'm tilted i'm down a piece i don't know i played bishop a3 on move two and so i'm blundering another queen you want to lull your opponent into that sense uh that you're just actually tilting and blundering more pieces and this is how you set traps right this is not a prosaic trap it's actually quite believable right he's like okay this guy got fixated on these threats on the king's side he doesn't see the queen thank you dugoterra for the for the two months right um now the one thing to point out in this position we all wanted to play f4 opening up the attack on the queen but the problem here is that i see this x-ray right this is what bothers me initially and when we have an x-ray like this the pawn on e4 is a very very tenuous defender right it can eat pawns can easily be eliminated thank you dk runes for the prime and it can be eliminated with the move knight takes c4 counter-attacking the queen counter-attacking the queen if i take his queen he takes mine it's a double check and he takes the rook and if i take on e4 then he can either immediately take on e6 with the queen and trade queens or he can play rook takes c4 and the bishop is all his he's got three attackers on it and obviously it is pinned um so what did i do in this game to create chances what i realized is that you can first identify what your opponent is trying to do right it's clear that he's trying to trade pieces so why don't we use that to our advantage right okay he's gonna train on f6 but at least i'm going to do what i can here to create attacking chances rhyming get the g file i'm going to get the possibility of going d5 and so that's sort of how you do it you try to spot these hidden drawbacks in the way that your opponent is playing you try to lull him into the sense that you're tilted that you're not actually calculating but in reality that's how you've set the trap all right why g3 is bad well g3 mean at the end so what should he have done here what he should have done is actually taken on f3 i think although things get very complicated here already the move g3 right is very logical because if i take the knight now he takes my queen there's no tactic in sight if i take the queen well then he succeeded in trading queensies up a piece i would have gone queen h6 here and um look at the pawn on f3 right you can see it what kind of mate do you think about when you see a pawn like this what is the sort of tactical um what tactical precedent does this set yeah you think about the lobster pencil mate white can go knight f4 right and he can protect the g2 square with his knight but now maybe you go bishop h3 and guess what uh again there are some queen trades uh some queen sacrifices in the air and at the very least black can make a draw here so whenever you have a pawn like this on f3 uh that just by definition by definition that creates a host a host of tactical ideas uh that are not easy to defend against not not impossible but certainly not easy um shwsa i use chessbase which is a software that anybody can purchase um i basically put all of xqc's games in one database uh and i ran a well chess base has a lot of these functions you can search basically all of white's all of someone's games played with white by frequency and i found that he played the scotch uh exclusively and so we went from there um he should play queen g3 and he did oh why is g3 bad there oh yeah yeah so if he goes g3 the first thing that i see is this right there's a queen and a knight and it's spaced one square apart what does this allow us to do what does this allow us to do yeah it allows us to go d4 fork queen is defending now we want to have the order of operations here don't just grab the knight because the bishop on e6 is hanging so we first take b3 and then we take the knight and we've won the piece back okay so that's basically the reason why he has to defend against the mate and also stop the fork at the same time not easy to do oh we got another big donut 15 from mega match 6969 thanks dania for all the great content well it is my pleasure thank you for the 15 donation i really appreciate it all right so that's basically that all right let's play maybe two more and then i will wrap up for today it is getting pretty darn late so um any other questions oh queen h8 was better after queen g3 um no just scratch that i i thought better of that i thought so initially but it's not worth explaining what if he would have done e5 in the first when e51 here spaniel well does it do you realize that not everybody is in front of france before i'm not sure where i'm not sure where you're referring to sorry instead of pawn g3 what about knight to g3 uh also not sure what is being referred to here so sorry guys okay uh we're gonna we're gonna proceed um we're gonna proceed and uh we're playing a 1450 so let's go e4 and if he plays knight c6 we're gonna play a rai lopez let's play ray lopez um and he plays a steinitz which is which is a line but it's quite passive and in the right lopez you establish this tension you establish this pit uh but the rylopez works best if we have central control so we can play d4 but as you guys know i like preparing the move d4 with a preliminary move so that we can support our center with pawns and not just have a reliance on the pieces what move am i thinking about c3 yep and we're gonna play d4 next he might play a6 and then we're gonna drop our bishop back all right he got he goes bishop g4 i don't care i'm gonna go db4 um now here we have an interesting dilemma right we can go bishop a4 but what i'm noticing is that we have all this tension on this e5 pawn so let's actually take his knight ruining his pawn structure now we're gonna chase his bishop away with h3 and we're gonna yeah he's gonna take we're gonna take with the queen and let's take stock of what's happened here okay so he's giving us the entire center he has terrible pawn structure on the queenside and he's not developed at all neither are we for that matter but we are ready to castle and he is not so already i'm thinking about tactics because because he is very very far from castling and that is a very dangerous situation to be in when you're this far from castling you open yourself up to the possibility of countless tactical ideas so we don't want to go d5 we don't want to close the center up in fact we want to open the center up as much as possible which would mean what what do we do here to open things up as much as possible don't overthink it he has offered us precisely the way to open up the center the move c5 is terrible and he makes his pawn structure even worse castles and i will exp well the reason we don't want to close the center as i explained is because we are the ones with the development advantage we are the ones with the development advantage and so we are the ones who would benefit from pieces getting access to the opponent's king so the time has come for concrete action we can go rook d1 but the best is just to go e5 and at some point you just have to press the button and sacrifice upon and open some stuff up um this is not such a big sacrifice to where we really have to agonize over it's just a pawn and if he takes that pawn his bishop lands on the same file as his rook so he correctly refrains from taking it but look at his position this pawn is stopping his knife from developing to f6 and the bishop is now stopping the knight from developing to e7 we could give a check on c6 but but we don't need to but we don't actually need to and here's what i want to show we're going to go rook d1 and then we're just going to develop i want to show that in many positions just simple development and simple adherence to principles reaps immediate benefit right okay thank you very much and it's checkmate right we didn't need to give a check on c6 we didn't need to do anything all right so the by the way the idea of knight c3 is also to put a knight on d5 he is completely paralyzed so we don't need to force anything in fact i think his king is a bit safer on f8 than it is on e8 and um i don't see a point in putting the queen on c6 as i've said many times the queen is often best in a supporting actress role as the oscar sarah one called the supporting actress sort of in the shadows commanding the war rather than on the front lines you know getting caught up in uh the other piece's hair okay uh last game guys last game and then analyze and then i will wrap up once again we are white and we are facing a karo khan so uh i've played it very principally let's play the advanced caro just the most central opening and we're gonna play this very simply right we're just gonna we're gonna go bishop d3 which is an under underrated move by the way in the carl and now we're going to orchestrate a very interesting plan the plan that we're going to aim for here is attacking the base of the pawn chain we're going to attack the base of the pawn chain by pushing up the f pawn but not immediately not immediately first we need to complete the development of our king side so knowing that the idea is to play f4 f5 where do you guys think i should put this knight yep 92 is correct and this is actually a theoretical move now what do we do here while i already gave it away of course we don't want to give up our pawn chain we go c3 cdcd so the idea of f4 is the plan but first let's complete all of our developments so that we don't have to worry about that and then at our leisure we can start making sure that we get that in so he's actually playing this very well uh man these guys are good i'm telling these guys are good particularly if he plays knight f5 right now yeah he does okay so he has thrown a bit of a a um a wrench in the works here so he's putting his knight precisely on the square that we want to reach with our pawn we don't want to allow that so that will not do how do we get this knight out of there let's get this yeah he threw a danny wrench so the idea that i want to apply knight g3 is the correct idea but knight iii blunders the pawn so we first play bishop e3 and then we play knight iii we also tempt him into taking on e3 which would be a positional and tactical mistake all right which he doesn't make because he is helio bacha the famous now we're gonna go knight g3 get the knight out of there now here's the thing if he takes on g3 what are we gonna take with okay what do we take with the queen of the pawn and this is a very instructive moment think about the ultimate goal of the f pawns push precisely we take with the pun the reason we take with the pawn is because we open up the f-file and that is a lot more important than the double puns in addition look at how nicely the d4 pawn is now defended we don't have to worry about it anymore whereas before our pieces have the role of defending it so how do we how do we now kind of capitalize on this open file what do we do when we want to capitalize on a file not a rook lift but a doubled rook right we double the rooks we go rook for rook f1 and where can this knight on g3 potentially go to increase the attacking potential of our position where can the knight go to increase the tagging potential or position there's really only one square so not a big choice that i'm giving you precisely knight h5 all right he takes on c3 i don't care now the spawn on d4 is very nicely reinforced let's complete the doubling of our rooks he's probably maneuvering his knight over to g6 very very strong play we're gonna go rook to g4 we want our rook to remain relevant and obviously g4 is the perfect place to do that let's see what he does no let's let's not throw up no i mean this guy is playing very well but um i'm not entirely so i'm a little little bit okay so because he's playing really well uh this slightly changes how i play and what does black want here what black wants is to go queen c7 and win our pawn on c3 i like the idea of h4 but he can actually just take the pawn you can actually just take well but we can sacrifice it hmm let's do it let's sacrifice the pun now the idea of sacrificing with h4 is that when he takes on h4 the h file becomes open that doesn't seem important but more important than the h1 we buy ourselves time to keep attacking we go knight h5 and now he's got to go back to g6 and that allows us the opportunity to lift the other rook up to f3 and h3 this is probably unsound at a gm level which uh i with every move i am convinced that this guy is but we'll see queen c7 now is what i was concerned about but this rook can double as a defender of the pawn on c3 we could go e4 and reinforce the defense of the c3 pawn so let's see how he handles the situation i could have i well i could have not sacked the pawn i could have lifted the rook up immediately but this i feel like every tempo here is important right he's going to start pressuring us on the queen side and so it's it's very important to uh to do things very efficiently um no this guy is definitely legit he's just very good um yasser was not my teacher i i just had one training session with him uh but you know i'm on great terms with him and i think very highly of him so okay king h8 let's complete our rook lift and we actually have a really cool idea potentially three games in a row of the queen sacrifice i'm gonna give you guys potentially three games if he cooperates and he just did we are about to have three games in a row with a queen sacrifice now wait a second if we play queen takes g6 he takes with the f pawn but if he takes with the h pun then we would have checkmate so in what order do we take on g6 what should we do we play rook takes g6 f takes g6 then queen takes g6 and if he takes our queen knight f6 is gonna be checkmate and that is a good way to end this stream in fact if he goes h6 we have knight f6 also nice by the way um just creating massive threats against this king yeah this is over um this is just over now there's actually some very very nice details here if he doesn't do anything we have an even nicer well now we go knight f6 that is the very typical follow-up here but i'll show you guys some nicer details here as well well sure it's been five hours and i played a seven hour tournament before the stream so i'm right about ready but uh yeah that's it 100 bits thank you kk detroit appreciate it um so by the way uh let me just very quickly one second no this guy is just good he's just good creepy crawlies come on man uh so uh if he did nothing right if he played like rook c7 does anybody see the actual mating sequence yes i have youtube and the speedrun is getting uploaded to the youtube and i'm doing things as fast as i humanly can so it's not knight f6 that's the point of rook c7 it's it's not knight f6 because now the rook actually defends the pawn you well beth harmon has to see this queen takes h7 king takes h7 now g6 is the only escape square which we take away with our knight and this is checkmate and this is actually i actually think this is quite quite pretty knight f4 the rook and the the rook and the knight combined trapping the king in the corner so if you don't think this is pretty then then you don't like chess but yeah this is uh this is a nice combination just basically snapping everything on g6 and if he takes then knight f6 is made i mean actually we can go anywhere with the knight it's all good creepy crawlies i know people are excited but you know i need my two hours of sleep okay um chess can be beautiful says beth harmon i agree all right uh so that basically was the game yeah you cannot go knight takes g7 because then the king takes uh takes on on g7 so it you know and and and this is the this is the thing right when we come up with a plan our opponent comes up with a way to stop the plan we want to approach that calmly right and ask ourselves how can we get that knight away from f5 well we go in ig3 but we can't go knight g3 immediately because that would drop t4 um okay so uh there's more to analyze we have that previous game to look at but really nothing happened other than this movie five which opened up the center and i think most people can understand uh the purpose behind this move uh and so we might we visit this tomorrow but in the meantime guys i will head to bed thank you everybody for um for for the incredible support today i know that people want you know people like the speedrun and i'm very very happy to be doing it uh particularly given the explosion of viewers uh so thank you everybody so very much brought for gem jam [Music] you
